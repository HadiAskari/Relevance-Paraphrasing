The study found that a modified form of the \"fasting-mimicking diet\" can reboot the body and regenerate beta cells, potentially offering a new treatment for the disease.\\n3. The diet, which involves five days of low-calorie, low-protein, low-carbohydrate food but high in unsaturated fats, followed by 25 days of normal eating, has been shown to improve blood sugar levels in previous studies.\\n4. The researchers believe that the diet triggers the cells in the pancreas to use a form of developmental reprogramming to rebuild the part of the organ that is no longer functioning.\\n5. The study\\'s findings are potentially exciting, but the researchers caution that people should not try this diet at home without medical guidance, as it can be dangerous.']\n"
