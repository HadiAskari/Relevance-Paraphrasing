"well this was around 9 years ago when i was a 2nd grader. so basically it was some kids birthday and since it was primary school most kids brought cupcakes and the teacher would pass it out to the class. me being the hungry little shit that i was i was desperately in the mood for some vanilla cupcakes but the teacher decided to pass out the chocolate ones first. after she had finished passing out the chocolate ones she picks up the vanilla ones and says, ""raise your hand if you want vanilla!"". at that moment i was talking to a friend and it took me a bit to process the fact that she just asked who wanted vanilla. i proceed to raise my hand and it turns out the cupcakes were right above me. i knocked the cupcakes out of her hand and they spilled  all over her. she got bat-shit angry and begins to make a scene in the middle of the whole cafeteria. she explained how i ""ruined her brand new shoes"" and the bitch even asked me if i had an allowance so i could pay for her shoes. she had asked me at the time if i was messing around and i said yes because i literally didn't know what else to say. after numerous emails from my mom to the teacher things finally cleared up and all was back to normal.**","When I was a second grader, I accidentally knocked over a tray of cupcakes that my teacher had just passed out, causing them to spill all over her and her new shoes","When I was a second grader, I accidentally knocked over a tray of cupcakes that my teacher had just passed out, causing them to spill all over her and her new shoes",** i wanted vanilla cupcakes so i raised my hand and knocked a whole box of cupcakes all over my teacher.
"this was a few months ago when i had just sort of received my learner's permit after getting like 98% or something on the test and had just started driving my manual car. this is going to be difficult to explain without making myself look stupid, but anyway: i was driving down station street with my dad supervising in the passenger seat and we're quietly chatting about all manner of nonsense as i trundle along at about 60km/h when suddenly a fire truck comes right up behind us, sirens blaring and travelling at at least 80, so my dad explains that i should pull as far to the left as i safely can to let them through, so i cautiously guide my car into the bike lane, making sure i won't kill any cyclists in the process. the fire truck safely screams pass and i pull back out onto the road. i get into the town of chelsea and go through the lights at the 4-way intersection. i'm halfway to the next street corner when i spot another fire truck in the distance coming head-on towards me. now, from the start i've got no idea where the fire is and where the fire truck wants to go. so i go across past the side street and this fire truck starts veering over into my lane, which has had its width severely reduced by the cars parked along the corner in front of the pizza shop and all i can see is this huge truck flashing its lights at me as it tries to go through my lane to get into the side street, my dad pushing himself down into his seat bracing for impact and the cars parked next to me. all i can hear is my dad screaming 'woah, woah, woah! woah! woah woah woah' in my left ear and the fire truck's sirens and horn in my right ear. i continue through at the same speed gripping the steering wheel like my life depends on it, concentrating very hard on not crashing into anything. i get past everything and go around the corner that made this entire situation much more complicated than it would have been on a straight road. the rest of the drive is my dad freaking out at me and telling me i was millimetres away from the parked cars. within a week though, he was much more relaxed about the whole event and let me back out on the roads again.","While driving with my learner's permit, I had a close call with a fire truck when it suddenly swerved into my lane, causing my dad to brace for impact and creating a tense moment","While driving with my learner's permit, I had to suddenly swerve into the bike lane to let a fire truck pass, but another fire truck veered into my lane, causing a tense moment with my dad screaming in my ear and the fire truck's sirens blaring","i nearly crashed into some parked cars and a fire truck in chelsea in a bizarre situation that wasn't included on my driving test, probably due to it being incredibly specific."
"good lord, this happened four months ago and even thinking about it still exhausts me. i was taking a study abroad course in costa rica with other students from my college. we stayed with host families in san jose, the national capital, and took daily spanish classes at a local school. every day after class, we would go on excursions with instructors from our college to places like museums and monuments. one day we saw a musical performance at the *teatro nacional*. it was still early in the afternoon when it was over, so we were all free to go shopping, get something to eat, or go home. now, up to this point i had usually stuck with whatever group was going to go somewhere interesting, but after a week of arguing and rushing around to places that i didn't really care about, i decided to explore the city by myself. the theatre was very close to our school, so i knew how to get around the area. i took this time to go to places that i had been wanting to see, especially chinatown (yes, san jose of all places has a chinatown.) i browsed a few shops but didn't buy much, and i concluded my adventure by having a smoothie at an ice cream shop. afterwards, i made my way toward *parque central*, which was my reference point for getting to the homebound bus. i retraced my steps to get back where i wanted to be, and it seemed like i was doing okay until i didn't recognize the shops around me. i backtracked and turned a different corner. nope, in still didn't recognize anything. this happened several times. i was starting to get annoyed, but i thought that one more turn would get me where i needed to be. it look at least an hour, but i did indeed get to the park. then i needed to find my bus stop. once again, i turned corners and went down streets and still couldn't find where i needed to go. the infuriating part was that i was going in circles over and over and recognized everything around me, but i just couldn't remember which turns i was supposed to make. there came a point where passers-by could tell that i was walking in circles, and a girl pulled me aside and asked if i needed help. she barely spoke english and i barely spoke spanish, and she realized that she didn't understand anything that i was saying. she took me to a local bank where she knew there would be english-speakers, and i asked a man how to get to the *barrio pilar* bus stop. he spoke to the girl for a minute and she told me that it was exactly five blocks ahead. i thanked her as much as i could and did what she told. thankfully, the bus was right there. i thought my predicament was over, but then there was the matter of getting off at the right stop. all of the houses in the neighborhood started blending together, especially as it started getting dark. i was confused, because i suspected that i had passed my stop but i recognized some of the landmarks i was passing. i got off at the stop that i thought was closest to mine and started walking. i still had no idea where i was going, and i didn't want to use google maps because (a) my phone battery was under 10% and (b) international data usage was insanely expensive. once again i recognized my surroundings, but still couldn't seem to navigate. it was starting to get really dark, and i was starting to get really scared. the streets were insufficiently lit, and some streets weren't lit much at all. i once passed by a loud barking dog that frightened me so much that i nearly cried, which is a testament to how paranoid i was because i love dogs. my eyes and ears were on 360 mode, looking out for anything suspicious. any time i could see or hear another person approaching i would run in the opposite direction; it didn't matter who it was. it was late at night in a urban neighborhood, and i couldn't take any chances. i walked and walked and walked, desperately trying to remember where my host family's house was, but no matter what i did i just got more lost. i eventually gave up and used google maps, praying that my battery wouldn't die on me. to my great relief i finally found the house. my host mother wanted to know what in the world i was doing out and about at 11 pm, and i explained that i had just gotten very, very lost. i flopped onto my bed, incredibly thankful that i was somewhere safe. an interesting side note: i found out via an email from my psychiatrist a week later that i have inattentive adhd. that may have had something to do with it.","The author became lost in San Jose, Costa Rica while exploring the city by themselves after a musical performance at the Teatro Nacional","The author recounts a harrowing experience of getting lost in San Jose, Costa Rica, after deciding to explore the city on their own during a study abroad program","i hate people so i wandered off by myself in the largest city in costa rica, got very lost, got help, then got very lost again. also, my phone was dead.**"
"i'm going to start off by saying that i hate birds. no particular reason why, they just give me the creeps. also, this happened yesterday.anyways, there's this beach by my house with a snack bar that serves things like ice cream, fries, hotdogs etc. on this day i was craving fries and gravy real bad. did i mention that the seagull population was surprisingly bigger than normal that day. i order my fries and immediately get the attention of the seagulls. i then grab a handful of fries and throw them as far away as possible to distract the seagulls so i can get away. here's where it gets bad. the fry toss may have distracted about 10 seagulls, there were still about 30 more. literally a tornado of seagulls started swarming me, getting about half a foot from my face. one seagull even ate fries right from the tray in my hand. here's where it gets funny. there's a park there with a bunch of kids and their parents. obviously i'm freaking out, i'm swearing, they're all laughing, i end up throwing my tray of fries, hitting a cloud of seagulls in the process and running away as fast as i can. terrible day.","You had an intense desire for fries and gravy at the beach snack bar, but your attempt to distract the seagulls with a fry toss only attracted more of them, leading to a swarm of about 30 seagulls surrounding you, with one even eating fries from your tray","You hated birds and had a bad experience at the beach with a group of seagulls that were attracted to your fries and swarmed you, causing you to throw your tray and run away","bought french fries, attacked by  seagulls, got scared and started swearing next to a park, everyone was laughing at me, threw my fries and ran."
"this fuck up actually happened today, what a privilege it is to share it will all of you. first and foremost, i must say that i just recently mastered the art of cooking with a skillet. i'm about to graduate high school and was just recently released from the confines of only knowing how to construct and consume cold sandwiches. today, i had what you might call an intense craving for a quesadilla of my own design. i'm only available to cook quesadillas on weekends, so as you can imagine, i went all out: chicken, onions, spinach, three kinds of cheese, and ready to serve with salsa and guacamole. you know the old saying, ""good things come to those who wait?"" unfortunately, i didn't adhere that advice at 12:43 p.m. on saturday february 13th. i usually like my tortillas a little bit overdone so they are nice and crispy. hearing and smelling my delicious mexican cuisine simmering away in the skillet, i decided i was too hungry to wait for it to be well done, and decided to precede to flip it over. problem was, i couldn't find a spatula: so i used a fork. what proceeded could only be described as horrendous and heart-breaking.the prongs of the fork caught the tortilla at an awkward angle and opened it, gracefully dropping it face-down and spilling all the ingredients into the pan. had i waited longer for the cheese to melt, this could have been avoided. not wanting the cheese to melt into the pan (becoming harder to scrub off), i lifted the pan from the stove to put in the sink. in my haste, i tipped the pan sideways and spilled scalding-hot ingredients all over the floor and all over my nearby dog, coating him in the searing remnants of the wonderful goodness that was once a vessel through which the culinary soul could be moved. you know that feeling you get when you accidentally hurt your pet? yeah, i am shit. as my dog yelped i yelled, ""fuck!"" at the top of my lungs. normally i wouldn't use this kind of language in the household, but knowing my parents weren't home, i let her rip: or so i thought. turns out my dad was at the front door talking to our super conservative stain glassed ass neighbors, whom i heard audibly gasp from the kitchen. safe to say, i won't be getting fundraiser sales from them this year.oh, and i burned myself as well. all my ingredients gone, i had to settle for a cheese quesadilla instead. my dog now rolls over in fear every time i come near him. all for a quesadilla. a quesadilla. edit: dog is okay. just a little freaked out.","The author recently mastered cooking with a skillet and attempted to make a quesadilla, but their attempt ended in disaster when they used a fork to flip the tortilla and spilled hot ingredients all over the floor and their dog","The author shares a humorous and unfortunate story about attempting to make a quesadilla, resulting in a series of mishaps, including spilling ingredients on the floor and burning themselves","tried to make a quesadilla, ended up burning my dog and disgracing my family in front of out fundamentalist neighbors."
"happened last night, but still posting here. i was in the shower last night, sat down in the tub to scrub my feet and legs with my back facing the spigot or whatever it's called. whenever i try to stand up, i hear a loud scraping noise and feel a quick tinge of pain. i look back and see blood seeping through my skin with a long cut next to the scraped part. it's about an inch to the left and a tiny bit above the top of my butt crack. i grabbed the nearest bottle of soap and washed that fucker out. we didn't have any bandaids big enough to cover all of it with the padded part, so i put the pad on the worst part and now whenever i rip it off, it'll be pulling on the wound. oh, i forgot to mention i have gym class later and i'll surely be feeling it when we're doing stretches. kill me now.","Last night, while showering, the writer experienced a loud scraping noise and pain while trying to stand up, resulting in a long cut near the butt crack with blood seeping through the skin","Last night, while showering, the writer experienced a loud scraping noise and pain while trying to stand up, resulting in a long cut near the buttocks with blood seeping through the skin",cut/scraped my left buttocks on the spigot in my shower and i'll be feeling it during gym class.

"tonight i (white male 20) decided to have a few drinks with friends (two white females 20/21) in my room and drive them up town in our college town to the clubs. no big deal. i do this all the time. it is getting time to leave and i decided to grab my car from the near by parking lot and pick up my friends at the door. on my way tot he lot i come up to a very intoxicated women (black and very underaged) in the grass struggling to put on her shoes. she has lost her phone and her keys but has had enough to drink she doesn't care one bit. i know that recent events in my college town, two women getting raped in the past three weeks, means it is not safe for me to just blow this off. i made a choice to help her back to her dorm and mostly make my friends late to the clubs up town. i struggle to get her to comply, but she agrees it is for the best for her to go home. in the process of taking her back to her dorm and attempting to be the stable anchor for her while she meanders in the general direction, i receive an infuriated call from my friends, demanding i bail on my new ward and accommodate the original plans. i explain the situation and they are having none of it. they leave without me to walk up to the club. after i successfully check the strange woman into her dorm, i attempt to meet my friends halfway and drive them the rest of the way. i park my car in a near by business, get out and try to explain in person the situation. again, they were having none of it. so now i am certain that my better judgement has cost me a preciously cherished friendship.","The author, a white male, made the decision to help an intoxicated black woman get back to her dorm after finding her struggling in the grass, despite the potential risk to himself and his own plans with friends","The author, a white male, decided to help an intoxicated black woman get back to her dorm after finding her struggling in the grass, despite the recent rapes in the college town and the risk of jeopardizing his plans with his friends",drunk bitches be tripping
"here's the skinny. i (28f) have somehow become the designated driver at our work. the business van is a [sprinter](http://www.mbvans.com/sprinter/home) with no side windows and i hate driving it. backing it up is stressful, but i don't tell my boss this.two days ago i had to pick up stuff from other greenhouses to bring back to ours. three destinations down and two more to go, at the fourth destination, the pickup area was this small area with short cement dividers. while trying to back up and turn at the same time, i hit the bumper on one of the dividers. ''tis but a scratch, nbd right, so i continue my duties for the day.later i had to get something from our production site before going out on the last drive of the day. one of my boss's have a dog on site who is terrible, she appears from no where, quickly getting behind and in front of moving vehicles, and letting her hound bark rip. i'm backing up and turning around, she shows up, i just happen to see her when she let's out her usual hound scream. i turn harder and hit the compost trailer. i get out to see if she and the sprinter our okay. she's perfectly fine because i dodged her but the damage to the sprinter bumper 'tis not but a scratch. i'm rattled. today is not going well. i stare down the dog who stops barking , feels my wrath, and leaves. i go off on my drive, in low spirits. pick up 15 glass panels from another greenhouse, bc a wind storm hecked up a part of our retail section. by this point in the day, it's 4:30pm, my shift ends at 4:30 and i run my own dog training business for which i have a training appoint scheduled for 5. on the drive home, i'm driving so carefully. speed limit or just below. a couple yards out from a green light, it turns yellow. sh*t,.. if i keep going i'm going to run a red. if i slow down to stop, i risk breaking the glass panels. i opt for not being hit running a red. i hear the glass slide out of position, first slowly, but they are picking up speed and making it's way to the back of my seat and *smash* into thousands of little pieces. the tears begin to roll.get back to work, tell my boss in  my boss and one coworker cleaned up the mess for me. i apologized the next day. i planned to clean it the following day since i got back to the greenhouse at 5 and we were done at 4:30.'tl:dr i fucked up by wrecking the work sprinter's bumper, narrowly miss running over my boss's dog, and smashing glass panels we needed to fix the gaping holes in the greenhouse wall.edit: was supposed to say ""crashing"" not ""rashing"" in the title...","In a series of unfortunate events, the author (a 28-year-old woman) damaged the company's Sprinter van, narrowly missed running over their boss's dog, and smashed glass panels while driving for work","In a series of unfortunate events, I (28f) wrecked the work sprinter's bumper, narrowly missed running over my boss's dog, and smashed glass panels we needed to fix the gaping holes in the greenhouse wall","format, ask to leave and just walk out."
"so for those of you who don't know, there is a google survey app for android you can download where you get to take surveys. after completing the surveys, you receive anywhere from $0.10 to $2.00 for doing a survey to use on the google play store. now with these surveys i have always lied. the more i'd fabricate these answers, the more ""valuable"" it makes my opinion. the more valuable my opinion is, the more surveys i get which means more play store credit. if i had been honest, i would not have gotten any surveys much like when i told my friend about the app and never got a survey after his first one. so far, i've received about $35 in play store credit by doing these surveys. so this morning, i got a google survey on my tablet. it was a 3 question survey. the survey asked if i had ever been to a water park called kelp water parks. i said yes. then it asked what my favorite slide was. i just chose a random name of a ride and proceeded to the next question.only then did i find out it wasn't a survey, but it was designed to fish out people like me. people who lie on their surveys. it told me that the kelp water park didn't exist. google then proceeded to scold me saying lying is a bad thing and it will most likely not consider me for future surveys. google caught me lying and left me feeling like i lied to my own father.","The author has been consistently providing inaccurate information through Google surveys to receive Play Store credit, but was recently caught by Google and scolded for lying",The author has been taking surveys through a Google survey app for Android and has been dishonest in their responses to receive more play store credit,lied to google. received a virtual spanking over their survey app.
