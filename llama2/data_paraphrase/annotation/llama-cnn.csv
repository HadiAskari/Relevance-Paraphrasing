"(CNN)The Palestinian Authority officially became the 123rd member of the International Criminal Court on Wednesday, a step that gives the court jurisdiction over alleged crimes in Palestinian territories. The formal accession was marked with a ceremony at The Hague, in the Netherlands, where the court is based. The Palestinians signed the ICC's founding Rome Statute in January, when they also accepted its jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed ""in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, since June 13, 2014."" Later that month, the ICC opened a preliminary examination into the situation in Palestinian territories, paving the way for possible war crimes investigations against Israelis. As members of the court, Palestinians may be subject to counter-charges as well. Israel and the United States, neither of which is an ICC member, opposed the Palestinians' efforts to join the body. But Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad al-Malki, speaking at Wednesday's ceremony, said it was a move toward greater justice. ""As Palestine formally becomes a State Party to the Rome Statute today, the world is also a step closer to ending a long era of impunity and injustice,"" he said, according to an ICC news release. ""Indeed, today brings us closer to our shared goals of justice and peace."" Judge Kuniko Ozaki, a vice president of the ICC, said acceding to the treaty was just the first step for the Palestinians. ""As the Rome Statute today enters into force for the State of Palestine, Palestine acquires all the rights as well as responsibilities that come with being a State Party to the Statute. These are substantive commitments, which cannot be taken lightly,"" she said. Rights group Human Rights Watch welcomed the development. ""Governments seeking to penalize Palestine for joining the ICC should immediately end their pressure, and countries that support universal acceptance of the court's treaty should speak out to welcome its membership,"" said Balkees Jarrah, international justice counsel for the group. ""What's objectionable is the attempts to undermine international justice, not Palestine's decision to join a treaty to which over 100 countries around the world are members."" In January, when the preliminary ICC examination was opened, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described it as an outrage, saying the court was overstepping its boundaries. The United States also said it ""strongly"" disagreed with the court's decision. ""As we have said repeatedly, we do not believe that Palestine is a state and therefore we do not believe that it is eligible to join the ICC,"" the State Department said in a statement. It urged the warring sides to resolve their differences through direct negotiations. ""We will continue to oppose actions against Israel at the ICC as counterproductive to the cause of peace,"" it said. But the ICC begs to differ with the definition of a state for its purposes and refers to the territories as ""Palestine."" While a preliminary examination is not a formal investigation, it allows the court to review evidence and determine whether to investigate suspects on both sides. Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said her office would ""conduct its analysis in full independence and impartiality."" The war between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza last summer left more than 2,000 people dead. The inquiry will include alleged war crimes committed since June. The International Criminal Court was set up in 2002 to prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. CNN's Vasco Cotovio, Kareem Khadder and Faith Karimi contributed to this report.","The Palestinian Authority officially became the 123rd member of the International Criminal Court (ICC) on Wednesday, giving the court jurisdiction over alleged crimes in Palestinian territories The ICC has initiated a preliminary examination into the situation in the Palestinian territories, potentially paving the way for investigations into possible war crimes committed by Israelis and Palestinians The accession to the ICC is seen as a move towards greater justice and accountability for alleged crimes committed in the occupied Palestinian territories, but both Israel and the United States have objected to the Palestinians' attempts to join the court","The Palestinian Authority officially became the 123rd member of the International Criminal Court (ICC) on Wednesday, giving the court jurisdiction over alleged crimes in Palestinian territories The ICC opened a preliminary examination into the situation in Palestinian territories in January, and the formal accession of the Palestinian Authority as a member of the court paves the way for possible war crimes investigations against Israelis The ICC's decision to allow the Palestinians to join the body despite opposition from Israel and the United States is seen as a step towards greater justice and accountability for alleged crimes committed in the region","Membership gives the ICC jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed in Palestinian territories since last June .Israel and the United States opposed the move, which could open the door to war crimes investigations against Israelis ."
"(CNN)Never mind cats having nine lives. A stray pooch in Washington State has used up at least three of her own after being hit by a car, apparently whacked on the head with a hammer in a misguided mercy killing and then buried in a field -- only to survive. That's according to Washington State University, where the dog -- a friendly white-and-black bully breed mix now named Theia -- has been receiving care at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital. Four days after her apparent death, the dog managed to stagger to a nearby farm, dirt-covered and emaciated, where she was found by a worker who took her to a vet for help. She was taken in by Moses Lake, Washington, resident Sara Mellado. ""Considering everything that she's been through, she's incredibly gentle and loving,"" Mellado said, according to WSU News. ""She's a true miracle dog and she deserves a good life."" Theia is only one year old but the dog's brush with death did not leave her unscathed. She suffered a dislocated jaw, leg injuries and a caved-in sinus cavity -- and still requires surgery to help her breathe. The veterinary hospital's Good Samaritan Fund committee awarded some money to help pay for the dog's treatment, but Mellado has set up a fundraising page to help meet the remaining cost of the dog's care. She's also created a Facebook page to keep supporters updated. Donors have already surpassed the $10,000 target, inspired by Theia's tale of survival against the odds. On the fundraising page, Mellado writes, ""She is in desperate need of extensive medical procedures to fix her nasal damage and reset her jaw. I agreed to foster her until she finally found a loving home."" She is dedicated to making sure Theia gets the medical attention she needs, Mellado adds, and wants to ""make sure she gets placed in a family where this will never happen to her again!"" Any additional funds raised will be ""paid forward"" to help other animals. Theia is not the only animal to apparently rise from the grave in recent weeks. A cat in Tampa, Florida, found seemingly dead after he was hit by a car in January, showed up alive in a neighbor's yard five days after he was buried by his owner. The cat was in bad shape, with maggots covering open wounds on his body and a ruined left eye, but remarkably survived with the help of treatment from the Humane Society.","A one-year-old dog named Theia survived being struck by a car, despite suffering head injuries from a hammer attack and being buried in a field Theia was found by a worker at a nearby farm, badly injured and severely underweight, and was taken in by Sara Mellado, who is caring for her and raising funds for her medical treatment Theia requires surgery to help her breathe and has a fundraising page set up to cover the cost of her care, with donations already surpassing the $10,000 target","A stray dog in Washington State survived being hit by a car, being hit on the head with a hammer, and being buried in a field The dog, named Theia, was found by a worker on a farm four days after she was believed to have died and was taken in by a local resident Despite suffering from a dislocated jaw, leg injuries, and a caved-in sinus cavity, Theia is receiving care at a veterinary hospital and has inspired a fundraising campaign to help cover her medical expenses","Theia, a bully breed mix, was apparently hit by a car, whacked with a hammer and buried in a field .""She's a true miracle dog and she deserves a good life,"" says Sara Mellado, who is looking for a home for Theia ."
"(CNN)If you've been following the news lately, there are certain things you doubtless know about Mohammad Javad Zarif. He is, of course, the Iranian foreign minister. He has been U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry's opposite number in securing a breakthrough in nuclear discussions that could lead to an end to sanctions against Iran -- if the details can be worked out in the coming weeks. And he received a hero's welcome as he arrived in Iran on a sunny Friday morning. ""Long live Zarif,"" crowds chanted as his car rolled slowly down the packed street. You may well have read that he is ""polished"" and, unusually for one burdened with such weighty issues, ""jovial."" An Internet search for ""Mohammad Javad Zarif"" and ""jovial"" yields thousands of results. He certainly has gone a long way to bring Iran in from the cold and allow it to rejoin the international community. But there are some facts about Zarif that are less well-known. Here are six: . In September 2013, Zarif tweeted ""Happy Rosh Hashanah,"" referring to the Jewish New Year. That prompted Christine Pelosi, the daughter of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, to respond with a tweet of her own: ""Thanks. The New Year would be even sweeter if you would end Iran's Holocaust denial, sir."" And, perhaps to her surprise, Pelosi got a response. ""Iran never denied it,"" Zarif tweeted back. ""The man who was perceived to be denying it is now gone. Happy New Year."" The reference was likely to former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who had left office the previous month. Zarif was nominated to be foreign minister by Ahmadinejad's successor, Hassan Rouhami. His foreign ministry notes, perhaps defensively, that ""due to the political and security conditions of the time, he decided to continue his education in the United States."" That is another way of saying that he was outside the country during the demonstrations against the Shah of Iran, which began in 1977, and during the Iranian Revolution, which drove the shah from power in 1979. Zarif left the country in 1977, received his undergraduate degree from San Francisco State University in 1981, his master's in international relations from the University of Denver in 1984 and his doctorate from the University of Denver in 1988. Both of his children were born in the United States. The website of the Iranian Foreign Ministry, which Zarif runs, cannot even agree with itself on when he was born. The first sentence of his official biography, perhaps in a nod to the powers that be in Tehran, says Zarif was ""born to a religious traditional family in Tehran in 1959."" Later on the same page, however, his date of birth is listed as January 8, 1960. And the Iranian Diplomacy website says he was born in in 1961 . So he is 54, 55 or maybe even 56. Whichever, he is still considerably younger than his opposite number, Kerry, who is 71. The feds investigated him over his alleged role in controlling the Alavi Foundation, a charitable organization. The U.S. Justice Department said the organization was secretly run on behalf of the Iranian government to launder money and get around U.S. sanctions. But last year, a settlement in the case, under which the foundation agreed to give a 36-story building in Manhattan along with other properties to the U.S. government, did not mention Zarif's name. Early in the Iranian Revolution, Zarif was among the students who took over the Iranian Consulate in San Francisco. The aim, says the website Iranian.com -- which cites Zarif's memoirs, titled ""Mr. Ambassador"" -- was to expel from the consulate people who were not sufficiently Islamic. Later, the website says, Zarif went to make a similar protest at the Iranian mission to the United Nations. In response, the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations offered him a job. In fact, he has now spent more time with Kerry than any other foreign minister in the world. And that amount of quality time will only increase as the two men, with help from other foreign ministers as well, try to meet a June 30 deadline for nailing down the details of the agreement they managed to outline this week in Switzerland.","Mohammad Javad Zarif, the Foreign Minister of Iran, has been in the news lately for his role in negotiating a potential end to sanctions against Iran For example, Zarif has a background in education and has spent time studying in the United States, where he was born to a religious traditional family in 1959 or 1960 (the exact date is not certain) Zarif has also been involved in controversy, including an investigation by the U","Mohammad Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, has been in the news recently for his role in negotiating a potential end to sanctions against Iran Zarif was born in 1959 or 1960 (sources disagree on the exact date) and received his education in the United States, where he was active in protests against the Shah of Iran Despite his important role in Iranian politics, Zarif has faced criticism and controversy, including an investigation by the U",Mohammad Javad Zarif has spent more time with John Kerry than any other foreign minister .He once participated in a takeover of the Iranian Consulate in San Francisco .The Iranian foreign minister tweets in English .
"(CNN)Five Americans who were monitored for three weeks at an Omaha, Nebraska, hospital after being exposed to Ebola in West Africa have been released, a Nebraska Medicine spokesman said in an email Wednesday. One of the five had a heart-related issue on Saturday and has been discharged but hasn't left the area, Taylor Wilson wrote. The others have already gone home. They were exposed to Ebola in Sierra Leone in March, but none developed the deadly virus. They are clinicians for Partners in Health, a Boston-based aid group. They all had contact with a colleague who was diagnosed with the disease and is being treated at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. As of Monday, that health care worker is in fair condition. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta has said the last of 17 patients who were being monitored are expected to be released by Thursday. More than 10,000 people have died in a West African epidemic of Ebola that dates to December 2013, according to the World Health Organization. Almost all the deaths have been in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Ebola is spread by direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person.","Five American individuals who were being monitored at an Omaha hospital after being exposed to Ebola in West Africa have been released, with one of them having a heart-related issue on Saturday but has been discharged and is still in the area The others have already gone home, and they are all clinicians for Partners in Health, a Boston-based aid group None of them contracted the fatal infection, and they had come into contact with a colleague who was diagnosed with the disease and is currently undergoing treatment at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland","Five Americans who were monitored for three weeks at an Omaha, Nebraska hospital after being exposed to Ebola in West Africa have been released One of the five had a heart-related issue on Saturday and has been discharged but has not left the area, while the others have already gone home The group was exposed to Ebola in Sierra Leone in March, but none developed the deadly virus",17 Americans were exposed to the Ebola virus while in Sierra Leone in March .Another person was diagnosed with the disease and taken to hospital in Maryland .National Institutes of Health says the patient is in fair condition after weeks of treatment .
"(CNN)A Duke student has admitted to hanging a noose made of rope from a tree near a student union, university officials said Thursday. The prestigious private school didn't identify the student, citing federal privacy laws. In a news release, it said the student was no longer on campus and will face student conduct review. The student was identified during an investigation by campus police and the office of student affairs and admitted to placing the noose on the tree early Wednesday, the university said. Officials are still trying to determine if other people were involved. Criminal investigations into the incident are ongoing as well. Students and faculty members marched Wednesday afternoon chanting ""We are not afraid. We stand together,""  after pictures of the noose were passed around on social media. At a forum held on the steps of Duke Chapel, close to where the noose was discovered at 2 a.m., hundreds of people gathered. ""You came here for the reason that you want to say with me, 'This is no Duke we will accept. This is no Duke we want. This is not the Duke we're here to experience. And this is not the Duke we're here to create,' "" Duke President Richard Brodhead told the crowd. The incident is one of several recent racist events to affect college students. Last month a fraternity at the University of Oklahoma had its charter removed after a video surfaced showing members using the N-word and referring to lynching in a chant. Two students were expelled. In February, a noose was hung around the neck of a statue of a famous civil rights figure at the University of Mississippi. A statement issued by Duke said there was a previous report of hate speech directed at students on campus. In the news release, the vice president for student affairs called the noose incident a ""cowardly act."" ""To whomever committed this hateful and stupid act, I just want to say that if your intent was to create fear, it will have the opposite effect,"" Larry Moneta said Wednesday. Duke University is a private college with about 15,000 students in Durham, North Carolina. CNN's Dave Alsup contributed to this report.","A student at Duke University has confessed to hanging a rope noose from a tree near a student union, according to university officials The student is no longer attending the campus and will be subject to a review of their conduct, as criminal investigations into the incident are ongoing The incident is one of several recent racist events to affect college students, and has sparked a strong response from the university community, with students and faculty members marching and holding a forum to condemn the act and express solidarity with victims of racism","A Duke University student admitted to hanging a noose made of rope from a tree near a student union, according to university officials The student, who has not been identified, is no longer on campus and will face student conduct review The incident has sparked outrage and a march was held on campus with students and faculty members chanting ""We are not afraid","Student is no longer on Duke University campus and will face disciplinary review .School officials identified student during investigation and the person admitted to hanging the noose, Duke says .The noose, made of rope, was discovered on campus about 2 a.m."
"(CNN)He's a blue chip college basketball recruit. She's a high school freshman with Down syndrome. At first glance Trey Moses and Ellie Meredith couldn't be more different. But all that changed Thursday when Trey asked Ellie to be his prom date. Trey -- a star on Eastern High School's basketball team in Louisville, Kentucky, who's headed to play college ball next year at Ball State -- was originally going to take his girlfriend to Eastern's prom. So why is he taking Ellie instead? ""She's great... she listens and she's easy to talk to"" he said. Trey made the prom-posal (yes, that's what they are calling invites to prom these days) in the gym during Ellie's P.E. class. Trina Helson, a teacher at Eastern, alerted the school's newspaper staff to the prom-posal and posted photos of Trey and Ellie on Twitter that have gone viral. She wasn't surpristed by Trey's actions. ""That's the kind of person Trey is,"" she said. To help make sure she said yes, Trey entered the gym armed with flowers and a poster that read ""Let's Party Like it's 1989,"" a reference to the latest album by Taylor Swift, Ellie's favorite singer. Trey also got the OK from Ellie's parents the night before via text. They were thrilled. ""You just feel numb to those moments raising a special needs child,""  said Darla Meredith, Ellie's mom. ""You first feel the need to protect and then to overprotect."" Darla Meredith said Ellie has struggled with friendships since elementary school, but a special program at Eastern called Best Buddies had made things easier for her. She said Best Buddies cultivates friendships between students with and without developmental disabilities and prevents students like Ellie from feeling isolated and left out of social functions. ""I guess around middle school is when kids started to care about what others thought,"" she said, but ""this school, this year has been a relief."" Trey's future coach at Ball State, James Whitford, said he felt great about the prom-posal, noting that Trey, whom he's known for a long time, often works with other kids . Trey's mother, Shelly Moses, was also proud of her son. ""It's exciting to bring awareness to a good cause,"" she said. ""Trey has worked pretty hard, and he's a good son."" Both Trey and Ellie have a lot of planning to do. Trey is looking to take up special education as a college major, in addition to playing basketball in the fall. As for Ellie, she can't stop thinking about prom. ""Ellie can't wait to go dress shopping"" her mother said. ""Because I've only told about a million people!""

"(CNN)Governments around the world are using the threat of terrorism -- real or perceived -- to advance executions, Amnesty International alleges in its annual report on the death penalty. ""The dark trend of governments using the death penalty in a futile attempt to tackle real or imaginary threats to state security and public safety was stark last year,"" said Salil Shetty, Amnesty's Secretary General in a release. ""It is shameful that so many states around the world are essentially playing with people's lives -- putting people to death for 'terrorism' or to quell internal instability on the ill-conceived premise of deterrence."" The report, ""Death Sentences and Executions 2014,"" cites the example of Pakistan lifting a six-year moratorium on the execution of civilians following the horrific attack on a school in Peshawar in December. China is also mentioned, as having used the death penalty as a tool in its ""Strike Hard"" campaign against terrorism in the restive far-western province of Xinjiang. The annual report catalogs the use of state-sanctioned killing as a punitive measure across the globe, and this year's edition contains some mixed findings. On one hand, the number of executions worldwide has gone down by almost 22% on the previous year. At least 607 people were executed around the world in 2014, compared to 778 in 2013. Amnesty's figures do not include statistics on executions carried out in China, where information on the practice is regarded as a state secret. Belarus and Vietnam, too, do not release data on death penalty cases. ""The long-term trend is definitely positive -- we are seeing a decrease in the number of executions (worldwide),"" Audrey Gaughran, Amnesty's Director of Global Issues, told CNN. ""A number of countries are closer to abolition, and there are some signs that some countries will be abolitionist by 2015. (There are) signals of a world that is nearing abolition."" While the report notes some encouraging signs, it also highlights a marked increase in the number of people sentenced to death in 2014. At least 2,466 people globally are confirmed to have been handed the sentence last year, an increase of 28% compared with 2013. The report notes that the spike in sentencing is attributable to mass-sentencing in countries including Egypt and Nigeria, ""against scores of people in some cases."" The organization found ""positive developments"" worldwide, with most regions seeming to show reductions in the number of executions. Opinion: Sharp spike in death sentences . Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, saw a 28% fall in reported cases, and executions recorded in the Middle East and North Africa were down 23% compared to 2013. ""Even though we've highlighted some of the negative developments... I think we would always highlight that there are positive developments,"" Gaughran said. ""Across the board, with the exception of Europe and Central Asia there were fewer reports of executions in every region."" The resumption of the use of capital punishment in Belarus -- the only country in Europe and Central Asia to execute people -- after a two year hiatus spoiled an near-universal decrease in countries using the death penalty by region. The United States has the dubious distinction of being the only country in the Americas to conduct executions, but the number of convicts put to death here fell slightly, from 39 in 2013 to 35 in 2014. The state of Washington also imposed a moratorium on executions last year. The U.S. remains one of the worst offenders for imposing capital punishment, with only Iran (289+), Iraq (61+), and Saudi Arabia (90+) executing more people in 2014. While figures are not available, Amnesty estimates that China also executes ""thousands"" of prisoners each year, ""more than the rest of the world put together."" The report also highlights the imperfections in the judiciary processes that lead to many sentenced to death. ""In the majority of countries where people were sentenced to death or executed, the death penalty was imposed after proceedings that did not meet international fair trial standards,"" the report stated. ""In 2014 Amnesty International raised particular concerns in relation to court proceedings in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, China, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Sri Lanka."" The United Nations Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, last year stressed the need to move toward abolition of capital punishment. ""The taking of life is too irreversible for one human being to inflict it on another,"" he said, in marking World Day against Death Penalty in October. ""We must continue to argue strongly that the death penalty is unjust and incompatible with fundamental human rights."" Amnesty estimates that at least 19,094 people were believed to be on death row at the end of 2014.","According to Amnesty International's annual report, governments worldwide are exploiting the specter of terrorism to justify the use of capital punishment, resulting in a rise in death sentences and executions The report notes a mixed trend, with a decrease in the global number of executions by nearly 22% in the past year, but a significant rise in the number of death sentences handed down, particularly in Egypt and Nigeria Despite positive developments in some regions, the use of the death penalty remains a contentious issue, with the United States and China being among the worst offenders, and the United Nations Secretary-General calling for abolition of capital punishment as it is unjust and incompatible with fundamental human rights","According to Amnesty International's annual report, governments around the world are using the threat of terrorism to advance executions, with at least 607 people executed globally in 2014, a 22% decrease from the previous year Despite this decrease, the number of people sentenced to death increased by 28% in 2014, with mass sentencing in countries like Egypt and Nigeria contributing to the spike The report highlights the use of the death penalty as a tool in countries' ""Strike Hard"" campaigns against terrorism, and notes that China executes ""thousands"" of prisoners each year, more than the rest of the world combined","Amnesty's annual death penalty report catalogs encouraging signs, but setbacks in numbers of those sentenced to death .Organization claims that governments around the world are using the threat of terrorism to advance executions .The number of executions worldwide has gone down by almost 22% compared with 2013, but death sentences up by 28% ."

"(CNN)Filipinos are being warned to be on guard for flash floods and landslides as tropical storm Maysak approached the Asian island nation Saturday. Just a few days ago, Maysak gained super typhoon status thanks to its sustained 150 mph winds. It has since lost a lot of steam as it has spun west in the Pacific Ocean. It's now classified as a tropical storm, according to the Philippine national weather service, which calls it a different name, Chedeng. It boasts steady winds of more than 70 mph (115 kph) and gusts up to 90 mph as of 5 p.m. (5 a.m. ET) Saturday. Still, that doesn't mean Maysak won't pack a wallop. Authorities took preemptive steps to keep people safe such as barring outdoor activities like swimming, surfing, diving and boating in some locales, as well as a number of precautionary evacuations.
