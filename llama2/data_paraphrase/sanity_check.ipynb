The Palestinian Authority officially became the 123rd member of the International Criminal Court (ICC) on Wednesday, giving the court jurisdiction over alleged crimes in Palestinian territories.\\n2. The ICC has initiated a preliminary examination into the situation in the Palestinian territories, potentially paving the way for investigations into possible war crimes committed by Israelis and Palestinians.\\n3. The accession to the ICC is seen as a move towards greater justice and accountability for alleged crimes committed in the occupied Palestinian territories, but both Israel and the United States have objected to the Palestinians' attempts to join the court.\"]\n"
