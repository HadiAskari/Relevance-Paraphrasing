      "For the following article: throwaway for obvious reasons but this happened on tuesday. i see myself as a straight male(considering i am married with 2 kids) but i do enjoy a little \"butt play\" here and there. so the other day it is my day off, my wife is at work and my kids are at school. i decide i am going to masturbate but add in a little butt play. my butt play object of choice? cucumber with saran wrap on it. so i grab me a cucumber(the smallest one because well i dont do this too often) and put some saran wrap on it and slather it up with lotion. i proceed to put it between the mattress and box springs and lay on my back. i lift my self up off the ground while simultaneously pushing myself onto the cucumber. all is good and well and i finish..for lack of a better term and get up to clean up. i go and dispose of everything and notice something feels \"off\" down there so i reach down there and i only feel one ball.....i start freaking the fuck out because one of my balls is stuck inside my body somehow. apparently the angle i was at combined with the movements i was making sent one of my balls back inside my body. so i am panicking...don't know what to do..i am jumping up and down for about a minute trying to get him to fall back down into my sack and it's not working. i am having a full blown panic attacking now and dont know what to do. so i start pushing on my abdomen and i finally feel my ball fall back down to where he belongs...needless to say i am definitely rethinking butt play time. \n",
