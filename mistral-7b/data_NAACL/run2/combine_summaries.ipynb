Hamilton's Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg\\xa0was third six-tenths of a second behind Hamilton. Hamilton has dominated Rosberg this season and has got pole in every race during the current campaign.\", \"Rosberg's deficit to Hamilton was six-tenths of a second on Saturday. He is also separated from the Briton by 17 points. But even more separates them as people. Rosberg grew up the son of privilege. His father, Keke, was 1982 world champion. He was brought up in Monaco. He attended a smart international school there. He speaks five languages. But his life is the quiet life. Not for him the Hamilton whirl of red carpets and celebrity acquaintances in Los Angeles. He is not tattooed from chest to leg. While Hamilton courts fame, Rosberg's dream evening finishes with him and wife, Vivian, staying in to watch an ‘educational documentary’, their yellow Labrador, Bailey, at their side. Family is important. He has known Vivian, an interior designer, since his teenage years. They make smoothies or ‘healthy’ pancakes when they home in Monaco or Ibiza. They gather fresh vegetables from their bio-garden. He relishes a bike ride to the beach for lunch. He loves his classic car — a light blue Mercedes 280SL Pagoda, as perfect as the day it was made in 1970. He bought it without Vivian knowing, but they both enjoy it now. He drives them through the sweeping mountain roads of southern France. Rosberg has a trait rare among modern Formula One drivers: a hinterland. He turned down a place at Imperial College to become a full-time racing driver. If he wins the World Championship this year he will do so with a book under his arm. He is the driver who never stops learning. Having married last year, he and Vivian are expecting their first child in August, during the sport's summer break. ‘Typical German precision,’ he jokes. ‘I’m very excited and very lucky,’ he says. ‘I just hope it all goes well. There is a link between your personal life and your racing life, naturally.’ But we know he is a nice, intelligent chap, more settled in life than his rival. The point when it comes to winning the most prestigious title in motor racing is whether he has the capacity — the skill and cutting edge — to beat such an extravagant talent as Hamilton, who eclipsed him last year. Rosberg has failed to match Hamilton this season, raising the question whether he will go the way of Mark Webber, who fell away after making his Red Bull team-mate Vettel fight him for his first title. Rosberg's deficit to Hamilton was six-tenths of a second in qualifying on Saturday. Jenson Button will start his 100th race for McLaren from last on the grid after his ailing machine again gave up on him during qualifying. It was the third time this weekend he had suffered a failure, the latest coming just four corners into his first lap. ‘It was a power cut,’ said Button. ‘I don’t know where it came from.' It is Rosberg who begins work with his engineers earlier and finishes later — and always turns up on time, unlike Hamilton — but genius sometimes makes its own rules. Raw talent is outstripping endeavour. As a barbecue was staged in a paddock here on Friday, he toiled in engineering meetings while the rest of us tucked in. He arrived after a brief stop in Dubai, relaxing and training, before heading to the track to face an inquisition. Why had he criticised Hamilton for slowing down seven days ago in China and thus imperilling Mercedes’ one-two finish? Rosberg answered in a relaxed and courteous manner. ‘Only today have there been millions of questions,’ he tells me once the wider interrogation was over. ‘Other than that I’ve had some distance from it all. I don’t think about it in terms of me getting under his skin or him getting under mine. For both of us it has been annoying to spend so much time on the topic. Hamilton and Rosberg pose together during their unveiling as Mercedes' new team in February 2013. ‘Lewis and I are\"]\n",
