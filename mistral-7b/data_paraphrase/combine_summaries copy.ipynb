Where am I going to live? Have I got somewhere where I can see my daughter.\"\\n\"You\\'re put out among the same sort of people doing the same sort of thing, and it\\'s difficult, it\\'s difficult to get away from it. It\\'s like every man for himself, there\\'s nothing.\"\\nMarc has now found stable accommodation with homeless charity Emmaus and said it had been life changing.\\n\"You feel safe, you got hot food, you\\'ve got company of people in similar situations to yourself but all dealing with different issues. It\\'s a constructive, helpful atmosphere,\" he said.\\nTom Clarke, chief executive of Emmaus South Wales, agreed there was not enough support available.\\n\"We do still see [people] homeless on the streets, so clearly they haven\\'t got accommodation and haven\\'t got provision,\" he said.\\n\"I think the key is connecting people with the services they need. I don\\'t delude myself that Emmaus can offer a one size fits all for everyone, we can\\'t.\\n\"But there must be other opportunities and given suitable encouragement I believe that can and should happen.\"\\nA Welsh Government spokesman said the national pathway for homeless services to children, young people and adults in the secure estate had prevented many people from losing their home whilst serving their prison sentence.\\nIt added there were already significant demands for one-bedroom flats across the public and private sector and it was providing 20,000 new affordable homes in the next five years.',\n",
       " 'Media playback is not supported on this device\\nThe Olympic silver medallist accused the organisation of \"ageism\" and having \"zero regard\" for her welfare.\\nShe is the latest high-profile cyclist to come forward after Jess Varnish, Nicole Cooke and Emma Pooley criticised the World Class programme.\\nHouvenaghel told the BBC she felt \"vindicated\" by a leaked draft report detailing British Cycling\\'s failures.\\nThe report said British Cycling \"sanitised\" its own investigation into claims former technical director Shane Sutton used sexist language towards Varnish, who went public last April about her treatment.\\nBritish Cycling subsequently admitted it did not pay \"sufficient care and attention\" to the wellbeing of staff and athletes at the expense of winning medals, an approach Houvenaghel attested to in her BBC interview.\\nBoth Sutton and predecessor Sir Dave Brailsford have now left British Cycling.\\nHouvenaghel, 42, spoke to BBC Sport during its State of Sport week, which on Thursday examines the issue of athlete welfare versus a win-at-all-costs culture.\\nA government-commissioned review, headed by 11-time Paralympic champion Baroness Grey-Thompson, into safety and wellbeing in British sport, is due to be published imminently.\\nIt is expected to recommend significant reforms designed to improve the way athletes are treated by governing bodies.\\nHouvenaghel claimed:\\nBritish Cycling said it \"has acknowledged and takes very seriously previous cultural and governance failings in the World Class Programme\".\\nIt said it has accepted the draft report\\'s findings and already put into a place a 39-point action plan to \"systematically address the cultural and behavioural shortcomings\".\\nThe statement added: \"Our new chair Jonathan Browning has apologised for instances where we have fallen short in our commitment to athlete welfare and has offered to meet with anyone who can help improve British Cycling.\"\\nWho else has spoken out?\\nHouvenaghel won silver in the individual pursuit at the Beijing Olympics in 2008, and gold in the World Championship team pursuit in 2008, 2009 and 2011.\\nShe retired in 2014, aged 39, after withdrawing from the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow with a back injury.\\nHouvenaghel was critical of both Sutton and her team-mates in the aftermath of the London 2012 Olympics, where she was left out of all three team pursuit races as Dani King, Laura Trott and Joanna Rowsell-Shand won gold in a world record time.\\nSpeaking to BBC Sport this week, the Northern Irish rider said that experience was \"very traumatic\" and she felt \"torment\" at having \"no explanation\" for her last-minute omission.\\nAt the time, Brailsford, then performance director, defended the selection saying they had to \"take the personal element out of it, and look at the data and be professional\".\\nHe added: \"I think when a team steps up and makes six world records on the trot and a gold medal, then I don\\'t think you can argue with that.\"\\nBritish Cycling reiterated that point on Thursday, adding it was \"proud to support Wendy in what was a wonderfully successful cycling career\" and she was \"part of a pioneering generation of riders who set new standards of excellence\", but was dropped in London 2012 \"based on her performance\".\\nOther elite cyclists, including King and Roswell-Shand have praised the leadership at British Cycling.\\nAsked whether she was simply not good enough for the 2012 team, Houvenaghel replied: \"It was definitely not about performance. I don\\'t think the fastest team on the day were permitted to race.\\n\"There are certain chosen riders on the team who will not have experienced the culture of fear and will not have been on the receiving end of that - the bullying, the harassment, being frozen out of opportunities.\\n\"It was horrid - it was not the training environment I expected. There was no choice. If you rocked the boat, you were out. There was no alternative.\\n\"Medals at any cost, that\\'s how it was whenever I was there, certainly in 2012.\"\\nHouvenaghel said she also witnessed the sexism that has been highlighted by other female riders, and also claims she was discriminated against because of her age.\\n\"I can certainly relate to the bullying,\" she said. \"For me personally, I felt it was more ageism - being a little bit older than my team-mates, it didn\\'t seem to be something that the staff necessarily wanted for our team in 2012.\\n\"They didn\\'t care about what happened to me afterwards. I never heard another thing from them.\\n\"After six years of constantly medalling at World Cups, World Championships, nationals, both on the track and on the road, they discarded me in a very undignified way from the team, which I don\\'t feel was right.\"\\nFourteen-time Paralympic gold medallist Dame Sarah Storey told BBC Sport that elite level sport in Britain is \"cut-throat\" but there are \"no excuses for crossing that line\" into bullying.\\nAsked about the balance between winning and athlete welfare, the 39-year-old replied: \"It\\'s a really difficult question because you have to be a human being, you have to allow for people to make mistakes. But the currency is race wins, the currency is gold medals.\\n\"It\\'s not an excuse but you have to have a thick skin in sport, you have to be able to take the rough with the smooth because of the racing that you go through.\\n\"But there are no excuses for crossing that line, and if those lines have been crossed they will be found out and they\\'ll be dealt with.\"',\n",
       " 'It\\'s no joke. But Kareem Badr says people did laugh in 2009 when he and two friends paid $20,000 (Â£13,000) for the Hideout in Austin, when it wasn\\'t making money and the previous owner decided not to renew the lease.\\n\"We took over a sinking ship and each brought a bucket to bail it out,\" says Mr Badr.\\n\"None of us had any experience of running a business. But we loved what we were doing enough that it carried us through.\"\\nThree years ago he was able to quit his day job and draw a salary from the club.\\nMr Badr says it\\'s still not as much as he used to make as a programmer (about $80,000 a year), but he now employs around 25 part time and contract workers.\\nAnd he recently expanded the premises, taking over the adjoining coffee house which sells alcohol, and leasing more theatre space.\\nMr Badr says: \"I think my background in computer science helped because I can take a big problem, break it up into small chunks, and figure out how to make it better and more efficient.\\n\"That\\'s basically what we did for every aspect of the business. And by doing that it naturally started to improve.\"\\nMr Badr may have been helped by national trends, which imply a growing enthusiasm for comedy clubs in the US.\\nAn industry report from data firm Ibis World expects total US annual comedy club revenue to grow by 1.8% over the next five years to $344.6m in 2020.\\n\"When the Hideout first opened it was the only improv theatre in Austin,\" says Mr Badr.\\n\"But now there are five [comedy] schools and four theatres. We were at the right place at the right time.\"\\nWhile the Ibis World report showed that dozens of US comedy clubs were forced to close in the wake of the 2008 recession, when fewer people had disposable income to spend on live entertainment, Stephen Rosenfield, director of the American Comedy Institute in New York, says stand-up comedy is now entering a new golden age.\\n\"The US has comedy clubs all over the country, not just in big cities, and they require talent,\" he says.\\n\"In any field there are those at the top who make dynastic fortunes. But because of the significance of the local comedy club, there is a career and a living to be made by good comedians who are not superstars.\"\\nMr Rosenfield says the growing popularity of stand-up comedy is fuelled in part by younger audiences, who view humorous TV hosts such as Jon Stewart, Jay Leno and Steve Colbert as their primary source for news.\\n\"It\\'s not just entertaining them, it\\'s also informing them,\" he says. \"There\\'s a new immediacy to stand-up that makes it much more appealing to a generation that\\'s on social media, tweeting, face booking and blogging.\"\\nBut clubs don\\'t only make money from entertainers. Alcohol alone can bring in as much as 40% of the night\\'s takings, and many clubs demand that audiences buy a minimum number of drinks per person.\\n\"A club really has three businesses going on,\" says Mr Rosenfield.\\n\"It\\'s an entertainment entity, a restaurant and a bar. They make money from selling drinks and dinners, and they make money from the cover charge.\\n\"There are usually three people on the bill. The opening act is the new comedian. They do about 20 minutes and introduce the other comics.\\nThe middle act does about half an hour, and then there\\'s the headliner. They almost always have TV credits, and are the ones people are coming to see. That headliner could be making six figures a year.\"\\nTop-tier performers make much more. According to Forbes, Canadian comedian Russell Peters grossed $19m with 64 shows in 2013, while industry veteran Jerry Seinfeld is the highest paid comedian in the US, set to earn $36m this year.\\nSteve Byrne, 41, is a veteran stand-up comedian based in LA, and star of his own television show Sullivan and Son, which ran for three seasons.\\nHe describes himself as a successful mid-level comedian who makes an annual six figure salary mainly from touring.\\nAnd although he was close to hitting a million dollars a year before his show was cancelled in 2014, he says most comedians make money at clubs and do television to boost their brand rather than their income.\\nMr Bryne says: \"Gigs vary because it depends what you\\'re contracted at.\\n\"If it\\'s somebody starting off in the business it could be $1,500 a show. For somebody who\\'s had some TV credits you could go from $4,500 to $7,500.\\n\"And if you\\'re just a knock out comic, then you\\'re coming in and getting a door deal. You\\'re taking all the tickets, and the club gets the concessions.\"\\nMr Byrne says hard work is the key to success. There is no magic short cut, and few lucky breaks.\\n\"The one single thing that an aspiring comedian should do is write, write, write. What is it that makes you laugh?\\n\"Your voice should resonate with your audience. So find your voice and you will find your audience.\"\\nWhile the music and film industries have been impacted by the internet, such as illegal downloads and reduced album sales, Mr Rosenfield says the online world has actually given live comedy a boost.\\n\"The format of comedy, particularly stand-up, lends itself to digital media like nothing else. One terrific joke can get a million hits,\" he says.\\n\"It\\'s become a new metric for a club manager. If a booker sees that a comic has 500,000 online followers - they\\'ll book him almost sight unseen. That\\'s it.\\n\"Digital is gigantically important and has been for a while.\"\\nBut in the end, the success of comedy comes down to a very simple fact - people need to laugh.\\nBack in 2001 Steve Byrne was a comedian in New York when terrorists flew two planes into the World Trade Centre on 11 September.\\nHe says: \"We all thought \\'who\\'s going to come to a comedy club? The dream\\'s over, I\\'ve got to get a real job now\\'.\\n\"But after a week, I forget which club was the first one to open its doors, but it was packed. People needed an outlet.\\n\"And I remember for months on end those clubs in New York City were just jam packed. That was the thing that told me that this was a profession that is foolproof.\"',\n",
       " 'Relieved that the giant telecoms company would not be broken up, they piled into the shares, sending them up 3% in early trading.\\nBT dodged a bullet - and, as the chief executive of Ofcom, Sharon White, admitted, it was for prosaic reasons.\\nShe said complications with land deals and BT\\'s giant pension scheme meant there were \"practical obstacles\" to a break-up that would delay the process several years.\\nIt\\'s the pension scheme that probably most influenced Ofcom\\'s thinking. BT\\'s retirement scheme, inherited from its time as a state-owned utility, has assets of about Â£40bn and a deficit, on some measures, of about Â£10bn, even though BT has poured in billions of pounds in recent years to redress the gap.\\nSenior sources at the company say that about 80% of the scheme relates to Openreach, the internet infrastructure provider that BT\\'s rivals would like to see spun off.\\nSeparating the pension as part of a break-up would be a costly headache - and there is the small matter of a government guarantee on part of the scheme, something that BT fought in the courts to preserve and won.\\nCreating two new pension schemes, with the risk of weakening the financial resources of one or the other, might be too hot a political potato, even in the pursuit of faster broadband.\\nBT\\'s share price reaction might turn out to be overdone. Ms White plans to enforce the separation by introducing not only a new board to run Openreach, but also new articles of association that will give directors a duty to serve customers of the network as much as the company\\'s owners.\\nThis holds out an obvious prospect of conflicts to come, and runs counter to the normal assumption that in private companies, the shareholder is king.\\nIt also carries an echo of the \"golden shares\" held by the government in Rolls-Royce and BAE Systems, two companies judged important for the defence of the realm. In each case, the golden share is actually enshrined by specific articles of association that give directors and the government powers beyond those normally enjoyed by company boards.\\nBT\\'s chief executive, Gavin Patterson, said he thought he could reach a compromise with Ofcom, but admitted they would need to see the detail of the new articles.\\nIf they prove too much at odds with BT\\'s own desire to control Openreach - which it will still own - get ready for a court battle and perhaps, eventually, a full break-up.',\n",
