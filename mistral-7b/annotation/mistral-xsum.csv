"Jordan Hill, Brittany Covington and Tesfaye Cooper, all 18, and Tanishia Covington, 24, appeared in a Chicago court on Friday.The four have been charged with hate crimes and aggravated kidnapping and battery, among other things.An online fundraiser for their victim has collected $51,000 (Â£42,500) so far.Denying the four suspects bail, Judge Maria Kuriakos Ciesil asked: ""Where was your sense of decency?""Prosecutors told the court the beating started in a van and continued at a house, where the suspects allegedly forced the 18-year-old white victim, who suffers from schizophrenia and attention deficit disorder, to drink toilet water and kiss the floor.Police allege the van was earlier stolen by Mr Hill, who is also accused of demanding $300 from the victim's mother while they held him captive, according to the Chicago Tribune.The court was also told the suspects stuffed a sock into his mouth, taped his mouth shut and bound his hands with a belt.In a video made for Facebook Live which was watched millions of times, the assailants can be heard making derogatory statements against white people and Donald Trump.The victim had been dropped off at a McDonalds to meet Mr Hill - who was one of his friends - on 31 December.He was found by a police officer on Tuesday, 3 January, a day after he was reported missing by his parents.Prosecutors say the suspects each face two hate crimes counts, one because of the victim's race and the other because of his disabilities.","The court was also told the suspects stuffed a sock into his mouth, taped his mouth shut and bound his hands with a belt","The victim was dropped off at a McDonald's to meet one of his friends, but was later found by a police officer a day after he was reported missing by his parents","Four people accused of kidnapping and torturing a mentally disabled man in a ""racially motivated"" attack streamed on Facebook have been denied bail."
"But there certainly should be.These are two of the biggest firms in the lucrative international business of making spectacles. France's Essilor is the world's number one manufacturer of lenses and contact lenses, while Italy's Luxottica is the leading frame manufacturer.It is not obvious that the merger is in the public interest, though the two firms certainly think it is.""The parties' activities are highly complementary and the deal would generate significant synergies and innovation and would be beneficial to customers,"" says Essilor.But there seems to be growing disquiet in the industry.Gordon Ilett, of the Association of Optometrists, says: ""This now allows the [enlarged] group to control all aspects of supply of product - from manufacture to the end user.""Those businesses who remain as their customers will be indirectly controlled by the terms and conditions imposed by them.""Whether their UK market share, following this merger, is sufficient for examination by the competition authorities is open to debate, but the effect of it will be reduced choice for the consumer, and will most likely result in reduced quality products longer term,"" Mr Ilett adds.If the deal goes through later this year the new company, to be called EssilorLuxottica, will become a behemoth of the industry.It will sell not only lenses and frames around the world but will also be stocking its own optician's shops as well, such as Sunglass Hut, and LensCrafters in the US and Australia, both currently owned by Luxottica.One long-standing independent UK wholesaler, who asked to remain anonymous, says the merged firm would be so powerful it would probably squeeze out some competitors.""If those two companies merged there would be a branded frame supplier offering you high-end branded frames, and also offering UK opticians a lens and glazing deal, to suit, so they will control almost everything [they offer] to both independent retailers in the High Street and even the chains,"" he argues.In his view this would amount, almost, to a stranglehold on the supply of high-end glasses, with some rivals giving up.""I imagine it would knock out quite a few glazing houses in the UK, and it would probably knock out other fashion frame houses,"" he adds.Unless you know about the eyewear business, or take an interest in investing in big European companies (they both have stock market listings) the names of the two big firms will probably have passed you by.But if you have been inside an optician's shop you will certainly have heard of the brands they own and make. For instance, the leading varifocal lens brand, Varilux, is made by Essilor.Just a year ago, in presenting its 2015 financial results to investors, Essilor boasted that it was ""an undisputed leader with only 25% market share"" of the combined world market for prescription lenses, sunglasses lenses and lenses for reading glasses.When it comes to just the prescription lenses, it has a 41% share of the world market.For its part, Luxottica owns several of its own brand names such as Ray-Ban and Oakley, and it also makes, under licence, spectacle frames which carry high-fashion names such as Armani, Burberry, Bulgari, Chanel, Prada, Ralph Lauren and Versace.In 2015 the Italian firm made almost 10% of the 954 million frames that were sold worldwide that year, and claims that about half a billion of its frames are currently perched on people's noses.The overall industry internationally is in fact quite fragmented with hundreds of other smaller manufacturers and related businesses such as glazing laboratories.Market research firm GFK describes the optical industry as ""a complex and extremely competitive market-space"".Even so, with the two firms having a combined turnover of more than 15bn euros (Â£12.8bn), of which 3.5bn euros were in Europe, on the grounds of size alone the proposed merger easily meets the requirements of the European Commission for a formal review.These are:An inquiry would see if the merged firm threatened to be too dominant, thus reducing competition and leading to higher prices for the customers.A Luxottica spokesman told the BBC that the firm was confident that any scrutiny would not hinder the deal.""The transaction is subject to mandatory submission to a number of anti-monopoly authorities including the European one, as is customary in transactions of this size and nature,"" he said.""We are confident that the transaction does not raise anti-monopoly issues and will fully co-operate with the anti-monopoly authorities to obtain the required clearance,"" he added.The EU itself says it currently has no comment to make and it has not yet been formally notified of the merger deal under the requirements of its own rules.But the leading chain of opticians, Specsavers, views the impending deal with caution.""Mergers are a continuing trend in optics, but this is a significant development which will result in huge supply chain and retail implications for the industry and consumers worldwide,"" the firm says.""It is unlikely that the impact of the merger will be felt by consumers straight away but we will watch with great interest how the new organisation will arrange itself.""If you have ever bought a pair of spectacles with anything other than the most basic frame and lenses, you may have gulped at the price, possibly coming to several hundred pounds.Of course, not all spectacles are expensive and not all of the sale price goes to the manufacturers.Opticians and the wholesalers that supply them are businesses that seek to make a profit.They also need to cover the costs of staff, equipment, shop and office space, stock and all that advertising.But for the manufacturers such as Essilor and Luxottica, it is a stonkingly profitable business.On worldwide sales of 6.7bn euros in 2015, Essilor made operating profits of 1.2bn euros.For the same year, Luxottica sold goods worth 8.8bn euros and made operating profits of 1.4bn euros.With cost-cutting at a merged business projected to save between 400m and 600m euros per year, profits could be boosted even further.Will customers benefit as well?",The two firms in question are Essilor and Luxottica,The merger of Essilor and Luxottica has raised concerns about reduced competition and higher prices for customers,"Since their impending merger was announced in January, there has been remarkably little comment about the huge proposed deal to combine Essilor and Luxottica."
"It's no joke. But Kareem Badr says people did laugh in 2009 when he and two friends paid $20,000 (Â£13,000) for the Hideout in Austin, when it wasn't making money and the previous owner decided not to renew the lease.""We took over a sinking ship and each brought a bucket to bail it out,"" says Mr Badr.""None of us had any experience of running a business. But we loved what we were doing enough that it carried us through.""Three years ago he was able to quit his day job and draw a salary from the club.Mr Badr says it's still not as much as he used to make as a programmer (about $80,000 a year), but he now employs around 25 part time and contract workers.And he recently expanded the premises, taking over the adjoining coffee house which sells alcohol, and leasing more theatre space.Mr Badr says: ""I think my background in computer science helped because I can take a big problem, break it up into small chunks, and figure out how to make it better and more efficient.""That's basically what we did for every aspect of the business. And by doing that it naturally started to improve.""Mr Badr may have been helped by national trends, which imply a growing enthusiasm for comedy clubs in the US.An industry report from data firm Ibis World expects total US annual comedy club revenue to grow by 1.8% over the next five years to $344.6m in 2020.""When the Hideout first opened it was the only improv theatre in Austin,"" says Mr Badr.""But now there are five [comedy] schools and four theatres. We were at the right place at the right time.""While the Ibis World report showed that dozens of US comedy clubs were forced to close in the wake of the 2008 recession, when fewer people had disposable income to spend on live entertainment, Stephen Rosenfield, director of the American Comedy Institute in New York, says stand-up comedy is now entering a new golden age.""The US has comedy clubs all over the country, not just in big cities, and they require talent,"" he says.""In any field there are those at the top who make dynastic fortunes. But because of the significance of the local comedy club, there is a career and a living to be made by good comedians who are not superstars.""Mr Rosenfield says the growing popularity of stand-up comedy is fuelled in part by younger audiences, who view humorous TV hosts such as Jon Stewart, Jay Leno and Steve Colbert as their primary source for news.""It's not just entertaining them, it's also informing them,"" he says. ""There's a new immediacy to stand-up that makes it much more appealing to a generation that's on social media, tweeting, face booking and blogging.""But clubs don't only make money from entertainers. Alcohol alone can bring in as much as 40% of the night's takings, and many clubs demand that audiences buy a minimum number of drinks per person.""A club really has three businesses going on,"" says Mr Rosenfield.""It's an entertainment entity, a restaurant and a bar. They make money from selling drinks and dinners, and they make money from the cover charge.""There are usually three people on the bill. The opening act is the new comedian. They do about 20 minutes and introduce the other comics.The middle act does about half an hour, and then there's the headliner. They almost always have TV credits, and are the ones people are coming to see. That headliner could be making six figures a year.""Top-tier performers make much more. According to Forbes, Canadian comedian Russell Peters grossed $19m with 64 shows in 2013, while industry veteran Jerry Seinfeld is the highest paid comedian in the US, set to earn $36m this year.Steve Byrne, 41, is a veteran stand-up comedian based in LA, and star of his own television show Sullivan and Son, which ran for three seasons.He describes himself as a successful mid-level comedian who makes an annual six figure salary mainly from touring.And although he was close to hitting a million dollars a year before his show was cancelled in 2014, he says most comedians make money at clubs and do television to boost their brand rather than their income.Mr Bryne says: ""Gigs vary because it depends what you're contracted at.""If it's somebody starting off in the business it could be $1,500 a show. For somebody who's had some TV credits you could go from $4,500 to $7,500.""And if you're just a knock out comic, then you're coming in and getting a door deal. You're taking all the tickets, and the club gets the concessions.""Mr Byrne says hard work is the key to success. There is no magic short cut, and few lucky breaks.""The one single thing that an aspiring comedian should do is write, write, write. What is it that makes you laugh?""Your voice should resonate with your audience. So find your voice and you will find your audience.""While the music and film industries have been impacted by the internet, such as illegal downloads and reduced album sales, Mr Rosenfield says the online world has actually given live comedy a boost.""The format of comedy, particularly stand-up, lends itself to digital media like nothing else. One terrific joke can get a million hits,"" he says.""It's become a new metric for a club manager. If a booker sees that a comic has 500,000 online followers - they'll book him almost sight unseen. That's it.""Digital is gigantically important and has been for a while.""But in the end, the success of comedy comes down to a very simple fact - people need to laugh.Back in 2001 Steve Byrne was a comedian in New York when terrorists flew two planes into the World Trade Centre on 11 September.He says: ""We all thought 'who's going to come to a comedy club? The dream's over, I've got to get a real job now'.""But after a week, I forget which club was the first one to open its doors, but it was packed. People needed an outlet.""And I remember for months on end those clubs in New York City were just jam packed. That was the thing that told me that this was a profession that is foolproof.""","There is no magic short cut, and few lucky breaks",Comedy clubs in the US expect total annual revenue to grow by 1,Have you heard the one about the computer programmer who bought a failing comedy club in Texas and turned it into a million dollar a year business?
"Relieved that the giant telecoms company would not be broken up, they piled into the shares, sending them up 3% in early trading.BT dodged a bullet - and, as the chief executive of Ofcom, Sharon White, admitted, it was for prosaic reasons.She said complications with land deals and BT's giant pension scheme meant there were ""practical obstacles"" to a break-up that would delay the process several years.It's the pension scheme that probably most influenced Ofcom's thinking. BT's retirement scheme, inherited from its time as a state-owned utility, has assets of about Â£40bn and a deficit, on some measures, of about Â£10bn, even though BT has poured in billions of pounds in recent years to redress the gap.Senior sources at the company say that about 80% of the scheme relates to Openreach, the internet infrastructure provider that BT's rivals would like to see spun off.Separating the pension as part of a break-up would be a costly headache - and there is the small matter of a government guarantee on part of the scheme, something that BT fought in the courts to preserve and won.Creating two new pension schemes, with the risk of weakening the financial resources of one or the other, might be too hot a political potato, even in the pursuit of faster broadband.BT's share price reaction might turn out to be overdone. Ms White plans to enforce the separation by introducing not only a new board to run Openreach, but also new articles of association that will give directors a duty to serve customers of the network as much as the company's owners.This holds out an obvious prospect of conflicts to come, and runs counter to the normal assumption that in private companies, the shareholder is king.It also carries an echo of the ""golden shares"" held by the government in Rolls-Royce and BAE Systems, two companies judged important for the defence of the realm. In each case, the golden share is actually enshrined by specific articles of association that give directors and the government powers beyond those normally enjoyed by company boards.BT's chief executive, Gavin Patterson, said he thought he could reach a compromise with Ofcom, but admitted they would need to see the detail of the new articles.If they prove too much at odds with BT's own desire to control Openreach - which it will still own - get ready for a court battle and perhaps, eventually, a full break-up.","Creating two new pension schemes, with the risk of weakening the financial resources of one or the other, might be too hot a political potato, even in the pursuit of faster broadband","The pension scheme of the company, worth about 40 billion pounds, was a major concern for the regulator","The reaction from BT's investors told us much about media regulator Ofcom's ruling on the fate of Openreach, the BT subsidiary that provides much of the UK's broadband infrastructure."
"""I'm really looking forward to it - the home of Scottish football,"" said Rodgers ahead of his maiden visit.""I hear the pitch is good, a nice big pitch suits the speed in our team and our intensity.""The technical area goes right out to the end of the pitch, but you might need a taxi to get back to your staff.""This will be Rodgers' second taste of the Old Firm derby and his experience of the fixture got off to a great start with a 5-1 league victory at Celtic Park last month.""It was a brilliant performance by the players in every aspect,"" he recalled. ""Obviously this one is on a neutral ground, but we'll be looking to have a similar performance.""We'll be prepared and focused. We know it's going to be a tough game. We anticipated that the last time.""Rodgers is also aware Celtic's visit to Hampden last season in the Scottish Cup semi-final against Rangers ended in defeat.""The last experience there wasn't so good for Celtic,"" he said.

""There's been great managers here in the past that haven't achieved that.""But it's the first competition where we've a chance to win a trophy and I've always said that it's a priority for us because it's the first one.""Our idea was to qualify for the Champions League, which we did, to make a good start in the league, which we've done, and then look to get to the League Cup final.""Unless you can do that then you don't have the chance to win the trophies.""",Celtic's previous trip to Hampden Park ended in a loss against Rangers in the Scottish Cup semi-final,He believes the pitch will suit the speed and intensity of his team,Manager Brendan Rodgers is sure Celtic can exploit the wide open spaces of Hampden when they meet Rangers in Sunday's League Cup semi-final.

"Iwan Wyn Lewis of Penygroes, Gwynedd, had been sectioned at Ysbyty Gwynedd after allegedly assaulting his mother.The 36-year-old was visited by an officer in April 2016 about his bail arrangements, which a doctor said could have added to his distress.His body was found in the Menai Strait on 2 May.Mr Lewis was receiving treatment at the hospital's Hergest unit and was later moved to the Cynan ward where he received the visit from the officer.Speaking at the inquest in Caernarfon on Thursday, consultant psychiatrist Dr Olufemi Adebajo said he was ""extremely unhappy"" about the visit.""I don't think the police should be able to come to the ward without special permission,"" he said.Asked by coroner Nicola Jones whether the conversation with the officer could have added to Mr Lewis' agitation and distress, Dr Adebajo said: ""It's quite possible - even likely"".He said he had known Mr Lewis for more than two years and never considered him to be a suicide risk.The day before his death, he had asked staff for extra medication because he said he was feeling agitated, but they did not change his dosage because they could see no sign of agitation.On the evening of 2 May, Mr Lewis told staff he was going to the shop, but 45 minutes later his body was found in the Menai Strait.The inquest continues.","His body was found in the Menai Strait, and the inquest continues","The day before his death, Mr Lewis had asked staff for extra medication because he said he was feeling agitated, but they did not change his dosage because they could see no sign of agitation",North Wales Police has been criticised at an inquest for sending an officer to speak to a hospital patient with paranoid schizophrenia.
