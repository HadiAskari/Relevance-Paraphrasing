"(CNN)The Palestinian Authority officially became the 123rd member of the International Criminal Court on Wednesday, a step that gives the court jurisdiction over alleged crimes in Palestinian territories. The formal accession was marked with a ceremony at The Hague, in the Netherlands, where the court is based. The Palestinians signed the ICC's founding Rome Statute in January, when they also accepted its jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed ""in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, since June 13, 2014."" Later that month, the ICC opened a preliminary examination into the situation in Palestinian territories, paving the way for possible war crimes investigations against Israelis. As members of the court, Palestinians may be subject to counter-charges as well. Israel and the United States, neither of which is an ICC member, opposed the Palestinians' efforts to join the body. But Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad al-Malki, speaking at Wednesday's ceremony, said it was a move toward greater justice. ""As Palestine formally becomes a State Party to the Rome Statute today, the world is also a step closer to ending a long era of impunity and injustice,"" he said, according to an ICC news release. ""Indeed, today brings us closer to our shared goals of justice and peace."" Judge Kuniko Ozaki, a vice president of the ICC, said acceding to the treaty was just the first step for the Palestinians. ""As the Rome Statute today enters into force for the State of Palestine, Palestine acquires all the rights as well as responsibilities that come with being a State Party to the Statute. These are substantive commitments, which cannot be taken lightly,"" she said. Rights group Human Rights Watch welcomed the development. ""Governments seeking to penalize Palestine for joining the ICC should immediately end their pressure, and countries that support universal acceptance of the court's treaty should speak out to welcome its membership,"" said Balkees Jarrah, international justice counsel for the group. ""What's objectionable is the attempts to undermine international justice, not Palestine's decision to join a treaty to which over 100 countries around the world are members."" In January, when the preliminary ICC examination was opened, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described it as an outrage, saying the court was overstepping its boundaries. The United States also said it ""strongly"" disagreed with the court's decision. ""As we have said repeatedly, we do not believe that Palestine is a state and therefore we do not believe that it is eligible to join the ICC,"" the State Department said in a statement. It urged the warring sides to resolve their differences through direct negotiations. ""We will continue to oppose actions against Israel at the ICC as counterproductive to the cause of peace,"" it said. But the ICC begs to differ with the definition of a state for its purposes and refers to the territories as ""Palestine."" While a preliminary examination is not a formal investigation, it allows the court to review evidence and determine whether to investigate suspects on both sides. Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said her office would ""conduct its analysis in full independence and impartiality."" The war between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza last summer left more than 2,000 people dead. The inquiry will include alleged war crimes committed since June. The International Criminal Court was set up in 2002 to prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. CNN's Vasco Cotovio, Kareem Khadder and Faith Karimi contributed to this report.","The Palestinian Authority officially became the 123rd member of the International Criminal Court on Wednesday, a step that gives the court jurisdiction over alleged crimes in Palestinian territories As members of the court, Palestinians may be subject to counter-charges as well The war between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza last summer left more than 2,000 people dead","The Palestinian Authority officially became the 123rd member of the International Criminal Court on Wednesday The formal accession was marked with a ceremony at The Hague, in the Netherlands, where the court is based As members of the court, Palestinians may be subject to counter-charges as well","Membership gives the ICC jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed in Palestinian territories since last June .Israel and the United States opposed the move, which could open the door to war crimes investigations against Israelis ."
"(CNN)Never mind cats having nine lives. A stray pooch in Washington State has used up at least three of her own after being hit by a car, apparently whacked on the head with a hammer in a misguided mercy killing and then buried in a field -- only to survive. That's according to Washington State University, where the dog -- a friendly white-and-black bully breed mix now named Theia -- has been receiving care at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital. Four days after her apparent death, the dog managed to stagger to a nearby farm, dirt-covered and emaciated, where she was found by a worker who took her to a vet for help. She was taken in by Moses Lake, Washington, resident Sara Mellado. ""Considering everything that she's been through, she's incredibly gentle and loving,"" Mellado said, according to WSU News. ""She's a true miracle dog and she deserves a good life."" Theia is only one year old but the dog's brush with death did not leave her unscathed. She suffered a dislocated jaw, leg injuries and a caved-in sinus cavity -- and still requires surgery to help her breathe. The veterinary hospital's Good Samaritan Fund committee awarded some money to help pay for the dog's treatment, but Mellado has set up a fundraising page to help meet the remaining cost of the dog's care. She's also created a Facebook page to keep supporters updated. Donors have already surpassed the $10,000 target, inspired by Theia's tale of survival against the odds. On the fundraising page, Mellado writes, ""She is in desperate need of extensive medical procedures to fix her nasal damage and reset her jaw. I agreed to foster her until she finally found a loving home."" She is dedicated to making sure Theia gets the medical attention she needs, Mellado adds, and wants to ""make sure she gets placed in a family where this will never happen to her again!"" Any additional funds raised will be ""paid forward"" to help other animals. Theia is not the only animal to apparently rise from the grave in recent weeks. A cat in Tampa, Florida, found seemingly dead after he was hit by a car in January, showed up alive in a neighbor's yard five days after he was buried by his owner. The cat was in bad shape, with maggots covering open wounds on his body and a ruined left eye, but remarkably survived with the help of treatment from the Humane Society.","Theia, a friendly white-and-black bully breed mix dog, has survived a car accident and a hammer attack, and is now receiving care at Washington State University The dog, who had been presumed dead for four days, was discovered by a worker on a nearby farm and is now being cared for by a foster family Theia's brush with death has left her with a dislocated jaw, leg injuries, and a caved-in sinus cavity, and she still requires surgery to help her breathe","A stray pooch in Washington State has used up at least three of her own after being hit by a car, apparently whacked on the head with a hammer in a misguided mercy killing and then buried in a field -- only to survive The dog, named Theia, was taken in by Moses Lake, Washington, resident Sara Mellado, who has set up a fundraising page to help meet the remaining cost of the dog's care Theia is not the only animal to apparently rise from the grave in recent weeks","Theia, a bully breed mix, was apparently hit by a car, whacked with a hammer and buried in a field .""She's a true miracle dog and she deserves a good life,"" says Sara Mellado, who is looking for a home for Theia ."
"(CNN)If you've been following the news lately, there are certain things you doubtless know about Mohammad Javad Zarif. He is, of course, the Iranian foreign minister. He has been U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry's opposite number in securing a breakthrough in nuclear discussions that could lead to an end to sanctions against Iran -- if the details can be worked out in the coming weeks. And he received a hero's welcome as he arrived in Iran on a sunny Friday morning. ""Long live Zarif,"" crowds chanted as his car rolled slowly down the packed street. You may well have read that he is ""polished"" and, unusually for one burdened with such weighty issues, ""jovial."" An Internet search for ""Mohammad Javad Zarif"" and ""jovial"" yields thousands of results. He certainly has gone a long way to bring Iran in from the cold and allow it to rejoin the international community. But there are some facts about Zarif that are less well-known. Here are six: . In September 2013, Zarif tweeted ""Happy Rosh Hashanah,"" referring to the Jewish New Year. That prompted Christine Pelosi, the daughter of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, to respond with a tweet of her own: ""Thanks. The New Year would be even sweeter if you would end Iran's Holocaust denial, sir."" And, perhaps to her surprise, Pelosi got a response. ""Iran never denied it,"" Zarif tweeted back. ""The man who was perceived to be denying it is now gone. Happy New Year."" The reference was likely to former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who had left office the previous month. Zarif was nominated to be foreign minister by Ahmadinejad's successor, Hassan Rouhami. His foreign ministry notes, perhaps defensively, that ""due to the political and security conditions of the time, he decided to continue his education in the United States."" That is another way of saying that he was outside the country during the demonstrations against the Shah of Iran, which began in 1977, and during the Iranian Revolution, which drove the shah from power in 1979. Zarif left the country in 1977, received his undergraduate degree from San Francisco State University in 1981, his master's in international relations from the University of Denver in 1984 and his doctorate from the University of Denver in 1988. Both of his children were born in the United States. The website of the Iranian Foreign Ministry, which Zarif runs, cannot even agree with itself on when he was born. The first sentence of his official biography, perhaps in a nod to the powers that be in Tehran, says Zarif was ""born to a religious traditional family in Tehran in 1959."" Later on the same page, however, his date of birth is listed as January 8, 1960. And the Iranian Diplomacy website says he was born in in 1961 . So he is 54, 55 or maybe even 56. Whichever, he is still considerably younger than his opposite number, Kerry, who is 71. The feds investigated him over his alleged role in controlling the Alavi Foundation, a charitable organization. The U.S. Justice Department said the organization was secretly run on behalf of the Iranian government to launder money and get around U.S. sanctions. But last year, a settlement in the case, under which the foundation agreed to give a 36-story building in Manhattan along with other properties to the U.S. government, did not mention Zarif's name. Early in the Iranian Revolution, Zarif was among the students who took over the Iranian Consulate in San Francisco. The aim, says the website Iranian.com -- which cites Zarif's memoirs, titled ""Mr. Ambassador"" -- was to expel from the consulate people who were not sufficiently Islamic. Later, the website says, Zarif went to make a similar protest at the Iranian mission to the United Nations. In response, the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations offered him a job. In fact, he has now spent more time with Kerry than any other foreign minister in the world. And that amount of quality time will only increase as the two men, with help from other foreign ministers as well, try to meet a June 30 deadline for nailing down the details of the agreement they managed to outline this week in Switzerland.","Mohammad Javad Zarif is the foreign minister of Iran and has been serving since 2013 He has also served as U Zarif has been accused of having a role in controlling the Alavi Foundation, a charitable organization, which the U","The article discusses Mohammad Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, who is known for his polished and jovial demeanor Zarif was born in 1960, according to his official biography, but the date of birth on the Iranian Diplomacy website is listed as January 8, 1961 The article mentions that Zarif was investigated by the U",Mohammad Javad Zarif has spent more time with John Kerry than any other foreign minister .He once participated in a takeover of the Iranian Consulate in San Francisco .The Iranian foreign minister tweets in English .
"(CNN)Five Americans who were monitored for three weeks at an Omaha, Nebraska, hospital after being exposed to Ebola in West Africa have been released, a Nebraska Medicine spokesman said in an email Wednesday. One of the five had a heart-related issue on Saturday and has been discharged but hasn't left the area, Taylor Wilson wrote. The others have already gone home. They were exposed to Ebola in Sierra Leone in March, but none developed the deadly virus. They are clinicians for Partners in Health, a Boston-based aid group. They all had contact with a colleague who was diagnosed with the disease and is being treated at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. As of Monday, that health care worker is in fair condition. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta has said the last of 17 patients who were being monitored are expected to be released by Thursday. More than 10,000 people have died in a West African epidemic of Ebola that dates to December 2013, according to the World Health Organization. Almost all the deaths have been in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Ebola is spread by direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person.","Five American individuals who were being monitored at an Omaha hospital after being exposed to Ebola in West Africa have been released One of the five had a heart-related issue on Saturday and has been discharged but hasn't left the area, Taylor Wilson wrote The others have already gone home","Five American healthcare workers, who were exposed to Ebola in Sierra Leone in March, have been released from an Omaha hospital after being monitored for three weeks One of the five had a heart-related issue on Saturday and has been discharged but hasn't left the area yet The others have already gone home and none of them developed the deadly virus",17 Americans were exposed to the Ebola virus while in Sierra Leone in March .Another person was diagnosed with the disease and taken to hospital in Maryland .National Institutes of Health says the patient is in fair condition after weeks of treatment .
"(CNN)A Duke student has admitted to hanging a noose made of rope from a tree near a student union, university officials said Thursday. The prestigious private school didn't identify the student, citing federal privacy laws. In a news release, it said the student was no longer on campus and will face student conduct review. The student was identified during an investigation by campus police and the office of student affairs and admitted to placing the noose on the tree early Wednesday, the university said. Officials are still trying to determine if other people were involved. Criminal investigations into the incident are ongoing as well. Students and faculty members marched Wednesday afternoon chanting ""We are not afraid. We stand together,""  after pictures of the noose were passed around on social media. At a forum held on the steps of Duke Chapel, close to where the noose was discovered at 2 a.m., hundreds of people gathered. ""You came here for the reason that you want to say with me, 'This is no Duke we will accept. This is no Duke we want. This is not the Duke we're here to experience. And this is not the Duke we're here to create,' "" Duke President Richard Brodhead told the crowd. The incident is one of several recent racist events to affect college students. Last month a fraternity at the University of Oklahoma had its charter removed after a video surfaced showing members using the N-word and referring to lynching in a chant. Two students were expelled. In February, a noose was hung around the neck of a statue of a famous civil rights figure at the University of Mississippi. A statement issued by Duke said there was a previous report of hate speech directed at students on campus. In the news release, the vice president for student affairs called the noose incident a ""cowardly act."" ""To whomever committed this hateful and stupid act, I just want to say that if your intent was to create fear, it will have the opposite effect,"" Larry Moneta said Wednesday. Duke University is a private college with about 15,000 students in Durham, North Carolina. CNN's Dave Alsup contributed to this report.",A noose was found near a student union at Duke University The student responsible for the noose has been identified and is no longer attending the university The incident is one of several recent racist events to affect college students,"A Duke student has admitted to hanging a noose made of rope from a tree near a student union The student was identified during an investigation by campus police and the office of student affairs and admitted to placing the noose on the tree early Wednesday Duke University is a private college with about 15,000 students in Durham, North Carolina","Student is no longer on Duke University campus and will face disciplinary review .School officials identified student during investigation and the person admitted to hanging the noose, Duke says .The noose, made of rope, was discovered on campus about 2 a.m."
"(CNN)He's a blue chip college basketball recruit. She's a high school freshman with Down syndrome. At first glance Trey Moses and Ellie Meredith couldn't be more different. But all that changed Thursday when Trey asked Ellie to be his prom date. Trey -- a star on Eastern High School's basketball team in Louisville, Kentucky, who's headed to play college ball next year at Ball State -- was originally going to take his girlfriend to Eastern's prom. So why is he taking Ellie instead? ""She's great... she listens and she's easy to talk to"" he said. Trey made the prom-posal (yes, that's what they are calling invites to prom these days) in the gym during Ellie's P.E. class. Trina Helson, a teacher at Eastern, alerted the school's newspaper staff to the prom-posal and posted photos of Trey and Ellie on Twitter that have gone viral. She wasn't surpristed by Trey's actions. ""That's the kind of person Trey is,"" she said. To help make sure she said yes, Trey entered the gym armed with flowers and a poster that read ""Let's Party Like it's 1989,"" a reference to the latest album by Taylor Swift, Ellie's favorite singer. Trey also got the OK from Ellie's parents the night before via text. They were thrilled. ""You just feel numb to those moments raising a special needs child,""  said Darla Meredith, Ellie's mom. ""You first feel the need to protect and then to overprotect."" Darla Meredith said Ellie has struggled with friendships since elementary school, but a special program at Eastern called Best Buddies had made things easier for her. She said Best Buddies cultivates friendships between students with and without developmental disabilities and prevents students like Ellie from feeling isolated and left out of social functions. ""I guess around middle school is when kids started to care about what others thought,"" she said, but ""this school, this year has been a relief."" Trey's future coach at Ball State, James Whitford, said he felt great about the prom-posal, noting that Trey, whom he's known for a long time, often works with other kids . Trey's mother, Shelly Moses, was also proud of her son. ""It's exciting to bring awareness to a good cause,"" she said. ""Trey has worked pretty hard, and he's a good son."" Both Trey and Ellie have a lot of planning to do. Trey is looking to take up special education as a college major, in addition to playing basketball in the fall. As for Ellie, she can't stop thinking about prom. ""Ellie can't wait to go dress shopping"" her mother said. ""Because I've only told about a million people!""

"(CNN)Paul Walker is hardly the first actor to die during a production. But Walker's death in November 2013 at the age of 40 after a car crash was especially eerie given his rise to fame in the ""Fast and Furious"" film franchise. The release of ""Furious 7"" on Friday offers the opportunity for fans to remember -- and possibly grieve again -- the man that so many have praised as one of the nicest guys in Hollywood. ""He was a person of humility, integrity, and compassion,"" military veteran Kyle Upham said in an email to CNN. Walker secretly paid for the engagement ring Upham shopped for with his bride. ""We didn't know him personally but this was apparent in the short time we spent with him. I know that we will never forget him and he will always be someone very special to us,"" said Upham. The actor was on break from filming ""Furious 7"" at the time of the fiery accident, which also claimed the life of the car's driver, Roger Rodas. Producers said early on that they would not kill off Walker's character, Brian O'Connor, a former cop turned road racer. Instead, the script was rewritten and special effects were used to finish scenes, with Walker's brothers, Cody and Caleb, serving as body doubles. There are scenes that will resonate with the audience -- including the ending, in which the filmmakers figured out a touching way to pay tribute to Walker while ""retiring"" his character. At the premiere Wednesday night in Hollywood, Walker's co-star and close friend Vin Diesel gave a tearful speech before the screening, saying ""This movie is more than a movie."" ""You'll feel it when you see it,"" Diesel said. ""There's something emotional that happens to you, where you walk out of this movie and you appreciate everyone you love because you just never know when the last day is you're gonna see them."" There have been multiple tributes to Walker leading up to the release. Diesel revealed in an interview with the ""Today"" show that he had named his newborn daughter after Walker. Social media has also been paying homage to the late actor. A week after Walker's death, about 5,000 people attended an outdoor memorial to him in Los Angeles. Most had never met him. Marcus Coleman told CNN he spent almost $1,000 to truck in a banner from Bakersfield for people to sign at the memorial. ""It's like losing a friend or a really close family member ... even though he is an actor and we never really met face to face,"" Coleman said. ""Sitting there, bringing his movies into your house or watching on TV, it's like getting to know somebody. It really, really hurts."" Walker's younger brother Cody told People magazine that he was initially nervous about how ""Furious 7"" would turn out, but he is happy with the film. ""It's bittersweet, but I think Paul would be proud,"" he said. CNN's Paul Vercammen contributed to this report.","The release of ""Furious 7"" on Friday offers the opportunity for fans to remember -- and possibly grieve again -- the man that so many have praised as one of the nicest guys in Hollywood There are scenes that will resonate with the audience -- including the ending, in which the filmmakers figured out a touching way to pay tribute to Walker while ""retiring"" his character Walker's younger brother Cody told People magazine that he was initially nervous about how ""Furious 7"" would turn out, but he is happy with the film","The release of ""Furious 7"" on Friday offers the opportunity for fans to remember -- and possibly grieve again -- the man that so many have praised as one of the nicest guys in Hollywood There are scenes that will resonate with the audience -- including the ending, in which the filmmakers figured out a touching way to pay tribute to Walker while ""retiring"" his character Walker's younger brother Cody told People magazine that he was initially nervous about how ""Furious 7"" would turn out, but he is happy with the film","""Furious 7"" pays tribute to star Paul Walker, who died during filming .Vin Diesel: ""This movie is more than a movie""""Furious 7"" opens Friday ."
