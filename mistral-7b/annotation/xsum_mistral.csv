0,"Tries from Macgraff Leuluai, Ah Van and Chris Bridge gave Widnes a 14-6 half-time lead, with Cas loanee Paddy Flynn responding against his parent club.
Flynn scored another early in the second, but Ah Van, Lloyd White (2) and Joe Mellor tries made it 38-12.
Despite three Cas tries in four minutes - Larne Patrick, Luke Gale and Flynn's hat-trick score - Widnes held on.
The Vikings' victory had looked assured when Mellor took advantage of Castleford indecision on a short kick-off, running straight through to help them to a 26-point lead.
But, having lost nine of their previous 10 matches, their defence creaked as they let Patrick, who has just signed a three-year deal to move from Huddersfield after his loan spell, in for a try.
Gale and Flynn - on loan at Castleford from the Vikings until the end of the season - made it a nervy finish, but the Tigers suffered their fourth consecutive home league defeat.
Widnes moved above Wakefield into seventh, while Castleford remain in sixth, one point above the Vikings.

1,"The Times reports that doctors in Kiev used a method called pronuclear transfer in what is a world first.
It is not the first baby born with DNA from three parents, however.
The baby girl, born on 5 January, is thought to be the world's second ""modern three-parent baby"" - another child was created using a slightly different method in Mexico last year.
The Kiev team fertilised the mother's egg with her partner's sperm. They then transferred the combined genes into an egg taken from a donor.
The child has the genetic identity of the parents, alongside a tiny amount of DNA from the second woman.
Doctors developed three-person IVF to help women who are at risk of passing on serious genetic disorders, called mitochondrial disease, to have a healthy child.
Eggs from a mother with unhealthy mitochondria and a donor with healthy mitochondria are collected.
The Nadiya clinic in Kiev used the technique to treat an infertile couple, not a couple carrying a mitochondrial disease.
UK experts said this was ""highly experimental"".
Valery Zukin, who led the work, said they had a hunch it would work for the Ukrainian couple who had not been able to conceive with conventional IVF.
He said he had a second patient - in a similar situation - who is expected to give birth in early March.
The UK has already passed laws to allow three-person IVF for couples with mitochondrial diseases, although no such baby has been born in Britain yet.
The science is new and controversial and raises ethical questions, including how any child from the technique might feel about having DNA from three people.
Prof Adam Balen, chairman of the British Fertility Society, said: ""Pronuclear transfer is highly experimental and has not been properly evaluated or scientifically proven.
""We would be extremely cautious about adopting this approach to improve IVF outcomes.""","A baby has been born to a previously infertile couple in Ukraine using a new type of ""three-person IVF"".","Valery Zukin, who led the work, said they had a hunch it would work for the Ukrainian couple who had not been able to conceive with conventional IVF","It is not the first baby born with DNA from three parents, however"
2,"University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust was rated as inadequate in an inspection by the Care Quality Commission (CQC).
It said the Royal Lancaster Infirmary and Furness General Hospital in Barrow needed to improve the quality of care.
The trust said it was ""part-way through a process of significant improvement"".
Last year, a separate trust covering the north of the county, North Cumbria University Hospitals Trust, was one of 11 put into special measures after the Keogh review found higher-than-expected mortality rates.
The CQC inspection took place in February and while inspectors said care in services such as maternity and A&E had improved since previous checks, they added other areas of concern had not been addressed.
Medical care in one part of the Royal Lancaster was said to be ""of particular concern"".
The overall recruitment of nurses and doctors was identified as a ""fundamental"" worry with ""too much reliance"" on temporary staff.
The chief inspector of hospitals, Professor Sir Mike Richards, said: ""There is a long history of concern with the quality of service provided by the trust, so it is disappointing to report that a number of the issues that have been identified in the past remain unresolved.
""I do not believe that the trust is likely to resolve its challenges without external support.""
As well as the hospitals in Barrow and Lancaster, inspectors also visited the Westmorland General Hospital, near Kendal, which was said to be providing a good service overall.
The trust's chief executive, Jackie Daniel said: ""The reports reflect the fact we are part-way through a process of significant improvement which is still going to take a number of years to complete.
""It isn't an overnight job to change the culture of a large, complex organisation.""
Full reports of the inspection have been published on the CQC website.","A failing health trust has been placed in special measures, meaning all Cumbria hospital trusts are now getting extra help to boost performance.","The overall recruitment of nurses and doctors was identified as a ""fundamental"" worry with ""too much reliance"" on temporary staff",The Royal Lancaster Infirmary and Furness General Hospital in Barrow fell short in terms of delivering high-quality care

The Red Devils looked down and out as they trailed 18-10 with two minutes left at the Lightstream Stadium.
But a second try from Niall Evalds and Greg Johnson's score with the last play of normal time levelled the scores.
O'Brien's missed conversion forced extra-time but he responded with a drop-goal from near halfway to win it.
It was a dramatic end to an enthralling game and resulted in Hull KR dropping out of Super League after a 10-year spell in the top flight.
It was also the second time in a week that Hull KR, who did not touch the ball in extra-time, suffered defeat to a late drop-goal.
Danny Brough's controversial effort last Saturday gave Huddersfield a 23-22 win to condemn the Robins to a place in the Million Pound Game.
Fighting broke out after the final whistle as Salford fans invaded the pitch to celebrate their side's stunning comeback.
There was little sign of the drama to come as Hull KR dominated the opening 20 minutes and led 10-0 through tries by Adam Walker and Josh Mantellato.
Ben Murdoch-Masila touched down from Salford's first real attack and they were remarkably level when Evalds went over in the left corner.
Mantellato's penalty just before half-time and Thomas Minns' second-half try seemed to have done enough to secure Rovers' place in Super League next season, only to be stunned by Salford's late fightback.
While Hull KR will play in the Championship next season, Salford's victory means a turbulent year at the AJ Bell Stadium ends on a high.
They were deducted six points in April for breaching salary cap regulations and had to settle for a place in the Qualifiers after losing their appeal.
That decision left owner Marwan Koukash considering his future at the club, which he bought in 2013 and has seen finish no higher than 10th.
But he intimated in the immediate aftermath of the win that he will now stay on.
Salford coach Ian Watson:
""Today was glammed up like a Grand Final, but it's a real serious game. I do believe in promotion and relegation, I just don't believe you should play off to decide relegation, you play off to win things.
""There's a big sense of relief because we felt harshly done to by losing six points. I feel for Hull KR and what they are going to go through in the next couple of weeks.
""I feel pleased and proud of the boys. It will be a real sense of achievement when they look back.
""I've seen last-minute drop-goals before but never one like that. It was a massive play by Gaz O'Brien. He's a tremendous kicker of the ball, but I don't think he'll ever kick one like that again.""
Hull KR interim head coach James Webster:
""Congratulations to Salford, they came up with three really good plays to win the game. They're a team that could strike from distance, we knew that.
""I'm proud of the boys, they put every single thing into it and that was a real high-quality game. It was one of the better games you'll see this year.
""The changing room is not a great place to be.
""I find it hard that a working-class sport can glorify something like this. This game has been glorified as a final. How is it a final? I can't fathom it all. If we'd won, I'd have said the same.""
Hull KR: Cockayne, Sio, Minns, Thornley, Mantellato, Campese, Marsh, Tilse, Lunt, Walker, Blair, Clarkson, Donaldson.
Replacements: Horne, Peacock, Allgood, Jubb.
Salford: O'Brien, Johnson, Jones, Sa'u, J. Griffin, Lui, Dobson, Burgess, Tomkins, G. Griffin, Murdoch-Masila, Hauraki, Flanagan.

4,"Until mid-July, her main worry was getting the right grades for medical school.
Now Chilla and her fellow pupils are faced with Turkish accusations that their school has links to a terrorist organisation.
Kharisma Bangsa school is one of hundreds across the world that Turkey wants to shut down because they have links to a US-based cleric, Fethullah Gulen.
The cleric is held responsible by the Ankara government for the failed July coup in which more than 270 people died.
And Turkey argues the schools are part of a strategy to undermine the state.
But pupils, teachers and parents interviewed in several countries say they have no links to suspicious activities.
Turkey looks to close Gulen schools
Who are the Gulenists?
Who is Fethullah Gulen?
Turkey coup: Who was behind Turkey coup attempt?
Kharisma Bangsa is one of nine Indonesian schools Ankara says should be shut down because of their alleged ties to Fethullah Gulen.
Turkey says the schools are part of a vast and secretive network which the Gulen movement has used to build a powerbase and infiltrate state institutions.
Accusations have been levelled against schools with Turkish connections in more than a dozen countries, from Germany to Afghanistan, leaving thousands of children facing uncertainty over their education.
Supporters of the schools say they are no more than a loose affiliation of institutions that share common values and are committed to academic excellence.
From extensive interviews with BBC World Service across 10 countries in three continents, it is clear that the schools have much in common but operate quite differently.
But all are feeling the pressure.
There is no common brand name for the schools.
In Pakistan they are called ""Pak-Turk Lycees"", in Kyrgyzstan they are known as ""Sebat"" (Persistence) schools, and in Kenya, ""Light Academies"".
Most were set up as partnerships between Turkish and local businesses and organisations, but in many countries like Indonesia and Kyrgyzstan, the Turkish partners are no longer directly involved.
Local and Turkish partners say they're admirers of Fethullah Gulen, but not connected to him formally.
""A Gulen school, business or newspaper is generally unofficially labelled as such, because the owner or manager considers Fethullah Gulen as a spiritual leader or source of inspiration,"" says Turkish academic Bayram Balci.
Alp Aslandogan, who speaks on behalf of Gulen-associated schools in the United States, says there are numerous social networks within the movement. ""The schools which are seen as affiliated with the movement were started by people who belong to these networks.""
Followers of Fethullah Gulen often refer to their movement by the name Hizmet (service), and the schools all share the same ethics.
""The teachers put emphasis on character-building, morals, and discipline,"" says Rosi, the mother of a pupil at Kharisma Bangsa.
There's also a strong focus on teaching science.
From Nairobi to Kandahar, school websites show pupils in smart uniforms, studying in well-equipped science labs or computer rooms.
""The children study every day until 3pm, then they have additional classes, activity clubs, and homework,"" says Baktigul, whose daughter attends a Turkish school in Kyrgyzstan. ""At 9pm they all sit down to have tea, and at 10pm it's bedtime.""
For Maxim Urazaev, who graduated from a Turkish lycee in the Russian city of Kazan in 2009 the experience was ""tougher than being in the army"".
Head teachers have told the BBC the schools are not part of a formal structure.
The head of Kyrgyzstan's 21 Sebat schools, Nurlan Kudaberdiev, says they are all connected to Fethullah Gulen informally because the schools were his idea. ""But there's no direct influence or financing from his side any more,"" he insists.
Long before the Turkish government tried to shut the schools down, other countries took action of their own amid suspicion of the network's foreign links.
In 2000, Uzbekistan shut down all Gulen-associated schools operating there, and similar steps were taken in Russia, where only seven remain of the 50 schools that used to operate until 2008. All are now firmly under Education Ministry supervision in the Turkic-speaking Muslim region of Tatarstan.
The schools describe themselves as secular, promoting tolerance and interfaith dialogue.
""In my five years at the school I never once saw a Koran or a Bible,"" says Maxim Urazaev, from Kazan.
But in Russia and elsewhere schools have been accused of running extra-curricular and secret, religious study groups.
Many former Soviet countries are deeply suspicious of religious activity beyond state control.
A former teacher in Tatarstan rejected the idea of ""secret gatherings"" but told the BBC that pupils who wanted to could pray with their teachers and talk to them about religion.
In Kenya, former students and teachers showed us books by Fethullah Gulen that they had been given.
In Kyrgyzstan, 15-year-old Zainal said pupils were sometimes shown videos about Islam.
But her mother, Bakhtigul, said she was satisfied it was not a problem. ""I even checked the books in their library to see if they had any Gulen literature or suspicious books, but there was nothing.""
Gulen-affiliated schools have existed in Turkey since the 1970s and only expanded into a truly global phenomenon in the past 20 years.
That expansion came as Fethullah Gulen grew closer to Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose Islamist-rooted AK Party swept to victory in 2002.
By teaching Turkish and promoting Turkish culture the schools helped to reinforce Turkey's position and influence across the former Soviet Union, the Far East and into Africa.
In 2015 Turkey invested $6.2bn (Â£4.7bn; â‚¬5.5bn) across Africa.
Somalia became a flagship for Turkish aid and investment, with three Gulen-linked schools catering for more than 1,000 children.
Although the schools are fee-paying and attract the children of the elite, they also offer scholarships to poorer families.
In Pakistan up to a quarter of children are on scholarships, in Afghanistan it is nearly 30%.
Quite apart from the lure of a good education, the schools also offer an opportunity to travel by way of inter-school competitions known as ""Olympiads"".
Star pupils from Kabul have competed in maths and Turkish-language competitions in Uganda, while children from Mogadishu have tested their skills in Kazakhstan.
The schools say the competitions are a way of making a global network of friends.
But Turkey argues they enable a movement responsible for a deadly coup attempt to continue recruiting new members worldwide.
Thousands of children and their families have been left feeling vulnerable, and for many their future at the Gulen schools is unclear.
""I've been here for eleven years,"" says Musukan, a sixth former at the Pak-Turk school in Islamabad. ""This was the best time of my life. We love it here.""
""If Turkey really has problems, don't involve us,"" says Salwa, an Indonesian sixth former. ""We're only here to study and to pursue our dreams.""

6,"Researchers found that four out of five children in England who ate school lunches had tried food at school that they had not tried at home.
Half of parents questioned said their children had asked for foods they had eaten at school to be cooked at home.
The survey, of about 1,000 parents, found the most popular vegetables were carrots, sweetcorn and peas.
Aubergine, chickpeas and spinach were among the least popular.
Of the parents questioned, 628 had children who ate school lunches.
(% denotes proportion of parents who said their child would eat each vegetable)
England's School Food Trust commissioned the research after a survey by the Mumsnet website suggested some parents gave their children packed lunches because they thought they were too fussy to eat anything else.
Trust chairman, Rob Rees, said: ""Every parent knows it's a nightmare watching their child push food around the plate.
""School meals can be a great way to help parents encourage their children to try new foods and to increase the variety of foods in their diet.""
Mumsnet co-founder, Carrie Longton, said: ""Getting children to eat healthily is every parent's dream, but meal times at home can often be a battle ground and emotionally charged.
""From Mumsnetters' experience it seems that once at school there's a desire to fit in with everyone else and even some positive peer pressure to boast about the variety of what foods you can eat.
""School meals have also moved on quite a bit from when Mumsnetters were at school, with healthier options and more variety.""
School meals in England now have to comply with strict nutritional guidelines.
About four in 10 primary school children in England now eat school lunches, slightly more than in secondary schools.
More children in Scotland eat school lunches - about 46%.
The survey was conducted online between 26 February and 5th March among a panel of parents who had at least one child in school aged 4-17 years old.","School lunches can tempt fussy eaters to try new foods, a survey for the School Food Trust has suggested.","The most popular vegetables were carrots, sweetcorn and peas",Researchers found that four out of five children in England who ate school lunches had tried food at school that they had not tried at home

8,"Eugenijus Tulauskas, from Lithuania, was up to four times over the maritime limit when arrested in September last year.
A pilot had to take control of the container ship to ensure its safe passage into harbour.
The 44-year-old seaman, of no fixed abode was fined Â£1,500 at Belfast Magistrates' Court.
Tulauskas had contested a charge of having excess alcohol while on duty as professional master of a ship.
His lawyers argued that he was not on duty at the time of the offence.
The court was told that an experienced pilot sent out to guide the ship into port thought he smelled alcohol on Tulauskas' breath.
He contacted Belfast Harbour Police who detained the defendant and took a breath sample.
Talauskas confirmed at that stage he had not taken any alcohol in the previous four hours.
The district judge said she was ""satisfied on the evidence that the defendant was not just master of the vessel, but was on duty at the time"".
Talauskas' lawyer argued that he was aware of the pilot's actions and had congratulated him on his manoeuvres.
""It's not a case that he was totally incoherent,"" the lawyer said.
The court heard that the captain had since lost his job.

9,"Tall, poised and elegant, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde has been described as having a rock-star appeal on the international political circuit.
By contrast, Mexico's central bank governor Agustin Carstens, is known for his rotund figure, which is often portrayed in Mexican political cartoons.
But Mr Carstens, 53, is by no means a joke candidate in the race to lead the IMF.
His economic credentials cannot be doubted.
He graduated with an economics degree from the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico, before collecting both a master's and PhD in economics from the University of Chicago, where deregulation and ""laissez-faire"" economics were the dominant views.
It was there that Mr Carstens, a former Little League baseball star, became a fan of the Chicago Cubs team.
It was also in Chicago that Mr Carstens met his wife, economist and author Catherine Mansell, who writes under the pen name CM Mayo.
After obtaining his doctorate in 1985, Mr Carstens returned to Mexico where he joined the central bank and rose through the ranks, his roles including chief of staff in the governor's office and director general of economic research.
While at the bank, he gained first-hand experience of dealing with financial crises, including Mexico's debt problems in the 1980s and the peso's crash in 1994 - experience which his supporters say make him the ideal candidate for the IMF.
He left the bank in 1999 to work as an executive director at the IMF, but returned to Mexico in 2000, serving as deputy finance minister under President Vicente Fox, marking his first ties with the conservative National Action Party.
In 2003, he rejoined the IMF as deputy managing director, where he was held in high regard.
When he left the role in 2006, again to return to front-line Mexican politics, Rodrigo de Rato, the IMF President at the time, described him as ""a superb ambassador for the fund, who carried high credibility with policymakers"".
Serving as finance minister for three years under President Felipe Calderon, Mr Carstens was responsible for pushing through new taxes to bolster Mexico's revenues.
But his biggest gaffe came in early 2009 when a reporter asked him if the economic troubles in the US would affect Mexico.
The reporter reminded him of the saying that when the US catches a cold, Mexico usually catches pneumonia.
Mexico's economy was in good health at the time and Mr Carstens replied the country would only get ""the sniffles"".
In fact, Mexico's economic output fell by 6.5% that year.
Nevertheless, sniffles aside, President Calderon nominated Mr Carstens to be the next head of the Bank of Mexico, a post he has held for the past year and a half.
But his pledge to work closely with the government raised questions about the bank's independence.
""Being autonomous on monetary policy does not mean you have to be isolated from the national economic debate,"" he said at his confirmation hearing.
Mr Carstens himself acknowledges Ms Lagarde is the favourite to replace Dominique Strauss-Kahn at the IMF.
""I'm not fooling myself. It's like starting a soccer game with a 5-0 score,"" he said on Monday.
He says he would bring ""a fresh pair of eyes"" to the role.
A European, he says, could face a conflict of interest, given the continuing debt crisis in some eurozone countries, while he can appreciate what emerging markets can contribute to the IMF.
But the fact he is from the Americas could work against him.
Robert Zoellick, from the US, currently heads the World Bank and some countries may not be keen to see the two global institutions led by officials from the same part of the world.
Traditionally, an American has headed the World Bank while a European has been in charge of the IMF.
And while Mr Carstens has the support of most of Latin America, Brazil - the region's largest economy - has yet to say whom it will back.
For Mr Carstens to be successful, he would almost certainly need Brazil to back him.",The two candidates competing to be the next managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) could not be more different in their appearance.,"Carstens's economic credentials are also highlighted, including his master's and PhD in economics from the University of Chicago and his experience in dealing with financial crises","Agustin Carstens, 53, is by no means a joke candidate in the race to lead the IMF"
