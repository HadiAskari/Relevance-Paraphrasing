0,"to give a little context about my self, i'm a high schooler who has always suffered from acne since a very young age. 

coming into my junior year, i have acne worse than ever before and worse than anyone else i've ever seen. i have tried dozens of different acne medications including over the counter along with prescriptions with some lessening but never a permanent solution. thanks to our family's insurance, my father managed to set up an appointment with an actual dermatologist rather than our normal clinic doctor.

the first appointment went smooth, got lots of new medications that seriously looked promising coming from a dermatologist. two more appointments were set up and it seemed to go pretty well for first week or so. afterwards, it had minimal effects but i was supposed to come back for my skin analysis and we'd get something worked out. 

my appointment came up and it was scheduled on a day where i couldn't skip a certain event (school's fault) so i thought, ""no biggie, i have one 4 days from now."" well turns out i misread the month and that appointment was a month later.

when that appointment came around, i fucking misread the date again. it was scheduled for august 27th but i read the date of my old appointment card for july 30th and assumed it was for august. that day, my father even called me reminding me my appointment was that day but he mixes up a lot of things (as do i apparently) so i told him he had the date wrong. 

que august 30th, i realized my fuck up. called quickly to reschedule an appointment and the next free slot they had was two months away. and by that time my father's insurance was going to be long over since he is retiring from his company.

at the end of the day, i'm stuck with a face scarred with acne that just completely shatters any confidence i have. it kills me inside knowing someone is just staring at all my acne while conversing and i'm at a complete loss at what to do.",face is a complete war zone and is my biggest insecurity**,i'm a high schooler who has always suffered from acne since a very young age,I'm a high schooler with acne worse than anyone else I've ever seen
1,"so my gf [f22] and i [m23] have been through a lot. we have dated for almost 5 years now and she ended things with me out of no where. i have been a little unstable this month and my anxiety and depression has been getting the best of me. usually have it under control but the stress this semester at school has really been getting to me. she knows this, and i actually recently reached out for help by the mental health center where i live. we get along, have typical fights, but i have been in a dark place and sometimes let things get the best of me and lash out at her. i do not lash out in the yelling you are a ""effing idiot"" kind of way, but maybe more in the i isolate and make rude remarks every once and a while when sharing my opinion about something she says that i disagree with. i always apologize but this time she has had enough. what kind of relationship would it be if people had the same opinion on everything?

not quite sure what i am going to do as the stress has been building up as i already have been feeling down and now i am financially unable to get my own place (as we live together). i do not have much credit to go get a loan. i go to school full time and that stress is already building up on me. i try my hardest to be a glass half full kind of guy but it feels like i left my glass out in the sun to evaporate on a hot sunny day, which is ironic as this winter has been one of the worst here in eastern canada.


the fight that started out of the blue which began this whole ending of or relationship is when she made a comment about the superbowl, which i am not a big sports fan but it is something i like to watch annually, being a big waste of money. i was already a little mad as we went to the bar so i could watch the superbowl her and her friends had no interest in it nor me, maybe that is just how i felt at the time. after her comment on sports i shared my opinion that professional sports are a form of business and i am certain that most dollars invested are returned in some way, just like the tv shows and movie she likes to watch. she did not like my opinion, probably the way i said it. they both are different but what they have in common is that they are both forms of entertainment. this lead to a big argument and now we are living together but no longer dating and i have been giving all the courage i have to not have a panic attack while i look for a one bedroom apartment. the thought of living alone scares the shit out of me, almost as much as the thought of living without her, but hopefully this leads to me overcoming that fear. anyone have some insight or previous experience they would like to share to help ""fill my glass back up""?",i have been in the blue and shared an opinion that conflicted with my gf which lead to us breaking up because she can't do this anymore.,I am going through a rough patch in my life and I don't know how to get out of it,This lead to a big argument and now we are living together but no longer dating and I have been giving all the courage I have to not have a panic attack while I look for a one bedroom apartment
2,"so, on april 1st of this year, my current boyfriend came out to see me. he lived about an hour away at the time and would make the trip every weekend it seemed to see me. i told him to meet me at a park near some dairy queen about 15 minutes from my house walking. he had gotten there about 5 minutes before i did so i told him to just sit out and wait considering it was a nice spring night. told him i'd be there in 10.

i'm about 5 minutes away now after making several stops to talk on the phone with my mother making sure she was ok at work, something i always do, thus making me a liar because it had been now more than 10 minutes since i sent that message to him.

*phone rings* i look down and its a text from him saying ""get here asap, cops are here and want to know why i am."" i being the cautious person i am thought it was an april fools joke. it just didn't make sense to me, and he likes to joke about stupid stuff all the time so to me it made sense that it was a joke.

i get to the dairy queen and see two cop cars, adam (my boyfriend) leaning against his truck looking rather scared and nervous, and some guy in the distance standing on his porch holding a gun, couldn't tell what kind. they cops asked me if i knew him and if i was here on my own free will and wasn't being paid or anything like that. i said ""no i told him to meet me here because my parents aren't home and its a nice night to i thought we could walk around and talk."" the one cop was nice about it and said ""well next time meet it a public place.""

after they left i looked at him and was like ""wtf happened?"" he explained that he was just sitting in the bed of his truck and some man walked up holding a gun in his face saying ""don't fucking move the cops are on their way."" i wasn't sure how to react thinking that he could've gotten hurt because i took too long.",basically i fucked up by taking too long and while adam was sitting in the bed of his truck and some man came outside thinking he was attempting some sort of robbery and pulled a gun on him and the cops weren't having it until he had proof i was a real person.,I walked up to the museum,He has a severe head injury
3,"i have a friend who lately has been showing more and more signs of being upset about something. those little subtle signs like ""yeah, maybe you'd all be better off if i just threw myself out of the window *laughs*"", ""i don't give a fuck if i die to be honest"", and a lot of others.

now, i'm not usually the most supportive person. i joke around and have a reputation for not taking things seriously. but this time, i wanted to help my friend, and i thought that since i was going to be serious about *this specific thing*, it would have more effect since that'd mean it was something really important to me and he'd probably feel better to know that i care.

i sent him a text message over whatsapp that was sort of like this (in my native language, so some things might not make sense or feel mistranslated):

""hey man, i saw that you have been kind of sad lately. i just want you to know that i am here to support you and listen to you. don't hold back those problems in your chest. know that you have a friend who can support you in these times, and that our friendship means a lot to me and i can't just stand here and watch you repress those feelings. that joke you sent on our group yesterday felt like a sign, a sign that you're trying to reach out to us or something. i don't know if i misinterpreted but all in all, even if you're not depressed, know that you can rely on me, man""

he started typing back a few seconds later. while i reread the message i felt that it was kind of... weird. you know the kind of thing a guy wouldn't say to each other? so i sent another one to lighten up the mood.
""no homo :p"" (this one was actually in english)

he stopped typing immediately after that. the message was seen and i was like ""uh, maybe he's just doing something else atm. i just wanted to get that across, i hope he feels better.""

now, 3 hours later he posts something on his facebook wall. a really long post and it had plenty of likes as well. i thought ""wow, maybe i inspired him or something. maybe i helped him express himself. posting about your depression on facebook is a bold move.""

it wasn't about depression. he was actually posting about how he decided to show the world a hidden part of him that he's had enough of repressing: he's gay. but that wasn't the main body of the text. it was about how one of his best friends couldn't accept that ""even though he most likely already knew, so he made a joke just to piss me off"". 

i scrolled down the comments section and people were asking him who was that asshole. after a few minutes (i didn't reply on the thread because i was pming him desperately to tell him that he misunderstood) he mentioned my name.

2 people messaged me and started calling me a homophobic douchebag. i didn't reply because honestly, what the fuck. my friends list dropped by about 20 people and after about 5 or so more messages i sent him, he just answered ""fuck off asshole. i had enough of your shit. don't ever message me again. thanks for showing me your true face"" and blocked me.

the only person who stood by my side was his sister. i messaged her asking wtf was going on and she said that my 'joke' deeply hurt her brother because he had feelings for me since a few months ago. apparently word was running around that someone had told me before i sent the message that he felt like that, and that i did that just to make fun of him. i explained everything to her and she was the only one who believed my account of the events.

 

edit: the ""joke he sent on the group yesterday"" was some really morbid description on the ways he'd want to hurt himself at work on purpose to get sick leave to get away from his dictatorial boss. some of the things he said were pretty graphic.","accidentally looked like a homophobic bigot while trying to help a depressed friend (who probably wasn't really depressed, since i misinterpreted nearly everything he said up to this point) and became a pariah in my circle of friends.","i didn't reply because honestly, what the fuck",i had a friend who recently showed signs of depression and it was affecting the way he saw the world
4,"so this fuck up was by my dad. when my dad is on the computer he is usually only half listening to what people are saying as he is completely consumed by ebay and sharing memes on facebook.


so the mother of a friend of mine from middle school battled cancer and sadly lost her battle last year. i had lost touch with this friend but i heard they were having a fire at the house for friends to come by to help them grieve. i told my mom and dad this and my dad did not internalize it correctly...


we were in the process of putting in a new fire place so a man from the fire department came to the house a few days later to take a look. this guy has a son in the same grade as my friend and i so he also knew about her mother's passing.


they started talking about it and my dad said ""what a tragedy, to have her pass and a fire at the house in the same weekend"". my dad thought there was an actual fire at the house... the fireman was completely confused and said he had not heard about it but would talk to the fire department to find out what happened. my dad told him ""my son told me about it"". so i became the asshole who spread the rumor that there was a fire at the house the same weekend of the passing of her mother. my dad still claims this is what i told him...","a friends mom lost her battle with cancer so they had a fire at the house for friends to come help them grieve. i told my dad who later told a man from the fire department ""what a tragedy, to have her pass and a fire at the house in the same weekend""...",my dad is not taking his antidepressants,"The fireman was also confused and said he had not heard about it, but would investigate further"
5,"this happened a couple weeks ago.

so a little background information. my university requires us to get a parking pass that lasts the whole semester and costs like $100. it's bullshit and most universities around me have free parking, but whatever.

the thing is, i couldn't get a permanent parking pass. i had just gotten a new car and the new tag hadn't been delivered to me yet so i was using a temporary one. for whatever fucking reason you can't get the permit with a temporary license plate.

this required me to get a daily parking pass every single day i had to go to campus which is $3, cash only. i only have to go to campus on tuesdays, thursdays and every other wednesday, so this wasn't too big of an issue.

so on thursday, january 19th, i was running late for class and ended up scrambling out of my house without cash. didn't have time to really stop at an atm so i couldn't get a new parking pass for the day. 

so, what i did instead, which i still think is an excellent idea considering the fact that students check these cars pretty nonchalantly, is change the date of the pass from the 17th to the 19th, by just adding a couple little loops. it looked fine to me and i carried on with my day.

fast forward to leaving class, i arrive at my car with about 4 signs pasted around my car telling me not to drive, a ticket on my car, and a boot on one of the tires saying not to move the car. as opposed to paying the $30 ticket that i would've gotten, i had to pay $150 to get the boot removed as well as get lectured by school security about how tampering with a ticket is a criminal offense.",tried editing a previous parking pass to avoid an inevitable ticket and ended up paying significantly more and getting yelled at by security.,I changed the date of the pass from the 17th to the 19th,I couldn't get a permanent parking pass
6,"so standard this tifu took place two days ago. i was lying in bed at 2:00 in the morning with my girlfriend watching some tv. things start getting a bit heated and it turns into some play fighting. we're having a bit of fun and all is going well until the fu happens.

she puts her hand towards me as i raise mine and she finger slams into my palm. i hear a *pop* and immediately  know what i'd done. she has pretty weak fingers from doing it before but yeah, i dislocated one of her fingers. 

she proceeds to do one of those crying laughs for about ten minutes before getting up the courage to put it back in. it then got worse when this sent her into shock and she went really cold and couldn't function for about an hour. after some ice to the finger and a hot water bottle to keep her warm she returned to normality.","lying in bed with gf, start play fighitng, dislocate her finger.",She proceeded to cry-laugh for about 10 minutes,"The OP was in bed with someone, and they were having a playful wrestling session"
7,"this has happened about 16 hours ago. so a little background info, my little brother always sets his alarm at 5:30am so he could do some early homework. also, my little brother always wakes up my mom so she could go to work. so the night before(sunday before monday), i was on low battery for my phone so i needed to charge it. since my family only has two iphone chargers, and all of us have the iphone 6, it was hard opening time to take a charge for once. so i went upstairs and saw that my little brother was at 100 percent, i decided to unplug it and turn the phone completely off. fast forward to the morning, it was 7:00 and i literally woke up from my little brother getting pissed off. my mom was stressing about being late to work, and my older brother came late to school. looking at this i was thinking of what happened and i realized that i turned off my little brother's phone with an alarm set. i haven't said anything because if i do, i would probably get smacked to a different nationality(im viet). my mom couldn't find her car keys so she ended up not going to work.","turned off my little brother's phone alarm, causing everyone to have a even worse monday",Turned off my little brother's phone with an alarm set,The article is about how the writer got pissed off at a stranger who was using a cellphone in public
8,"so, this happened a few hours ago, and i’m currently just laying in bed, dreading going to school tomorrow.

so, i had just got home from school a few hours before this happened. i was making lipstick at the kitchen table, and so my phone didn’t end up bright pink and sticky, i left it in my living room.

about ten minutes later, my little brother leaves the room with an evil little glint in his eye. due to the fact my hands were covered in lipstick, i did not follow.

fast forward a couple of hours. i just got out of the bath and i’m searching for my phone. it’s not on the cabinet in the living room, where i left it, it’s on the sofa, but i think nothing of it then leave.

as i’m walking up the stairs, i see a lot of strange messages on my phone, including ‘wtf bea?’ so i started to panic. i try to unlock my phone, but it’s disabled for ten minutes. i shouted to my siblings, “which one of you had had my phone?”

i sit in my room for ten minutes, while i wait for my phone to unlock, whilst both my siblings deny touching my phone. when it finally unlocks i quickly scroll up my form group chat to see this message, sent by myself

“magic im poo you can know that you have a lot more of your time on your mind and i will have you come in my house to do some sex with me.”

my brother had discovered that by sliding down on a message notification you can reply to it without unlocking your phone. then he had proceeded to disable my phone trying to get back into it.

i am dead.",my little brother messaged all of my friends about having sex from my phone.,My little brother had discovered that by sliding down on a message notification you can reply to it without unlocking your phone,"My younger brother took my phone, and I found out my account was disabled, and I discovered that he had been replying to notifications without unlocking my phone, and was trying to get back in it"
9,"tifu ... or rather a couple of days ago... that makes using my mousewheel a real joy these days...

&nbsp;

to frame the picture and to give you a little bit of background, suffice to say that i love cooking.

the day in question however things needed to go quickly, so i decided to simply use some of my frozen homemade pasta sauce.

now, the first place where i fucked up was in - for once - not freezing my pasta sauce in easily accessible and single portion freezer baggies.

the last time i made a big pot, i got lazy and dumped the whole lot into a moderately-sized tupperware container.

much too much for a single dinner for two in any case... sooo.

&nbsp;

i decide to simply use my large chef's knife to cute the frozen block of pasta sauce in half.

&nbsp;

*(now, if you've read this far and think you know what's coming... you've been warned...)*

&nbsp;

just fyi i'm left-handed... i hold my knives in my left hand and i hold my mouse in my left hand...

so there i am, trying to cut a solid frozen block of pasta sauce in half, i put the knife in the middle of the block of what amounts to ice, and use my right hand to slam down on the spine of the knife... (look away now...)

in principle this works perfectly... the block of ice splits neatly in the middle, leaving me with just the amount of frozen pasta sauce i want.

&nbsp;

were it not for one little fact, and that fact being that i somehow managed to get the index-finger of my left hand... mind you, the hand actually holding the knife... under the blade while it's coming down and slamming through the ice.

(i'm still trying to figure out how the hell i got a finger of the hand holding the knife in the way. i know how to wield a kitchen knife...)

&nbsp;

to get to the point, i manage to take half of the tip of my left index-finger off...

this in itself wouldn't have been all that bad... (i like to cook, i like sharp knives... shit happens, as anybody that's ever worked in a kitchen with sharp knives knows.)

&nbsp;

but what do i do...? well, that shit hurts...

so i take a step back and i start shaking my finger vigorously... as you do...

&nbsp;

bad move...

thing is... of course i managed to cut some sort of vein or artery in my finger, which naturally is already spewing a prodigious amount of blood...

now... me shaking my finger might have helped to stop the initial pain, but it also helped paint practically every surface of my kitchen a nice arterial red.

&nbsp;

suffice to say that the pasta dinner was on hold for the time being, while i spent the next 45min or so dividing my attention between staunching the bleeding and trying to wipe down the kitchen before my wife comes home to ask me why i decided to butcher the neighbours pets.

fun that... /s

&nbsp;

to bring things around to the actual point though...

since it's my left index-finger, and i'm using my mouse left-handed, and i like scrolling through /r/all...

all in all, this adventure went a long way to curtailing my pleasure in browsing reddit these last couple of days...

&nbsp;

oh, and...

sauté onions, garlic, salt and pepper with a decent amount of good olive oil until the onions and garlic start caramelizing. 

deglaze with a little bit of white wine or madeira and cook off the alcohol.

add a good tomato base or some nice and ripe peeled and deseeded tomatoes.

then cook down for about 20min with basil or the italian herb mix of your choice.

toss with the pasta of your choice and add generous amounts of freshly grated parmigiano.

&nbsp;
