"well this was around 9 years ago when i was a 2nd grader. so basically it was some kids birthday and since it was primary school most kids brought cupcakes and the teacher would pass it out to the class. me being the hungry little shit that i was i was desperately in the mood for some vanilla cupcakes but the teacher decided to pass out the chocolate ones first. after she had finished passing out the chocolate ones she picks up the vanilla ones and says, ""raise your hand if you want vanilla!"". at that moment i was talking to a friend and it took me a bit to process the fact that she just asked who wanted vanilla. i proceed to raise my hand and it turns out the cupcakes were right above me. i knocked the cupcakes out of her hand and they spilled  all over her. she got bat-shit angry and begins to make a scene in the middle of the whole cafeteria. she explained how i ""ruined her brand new shoes"" and the bitch even asked me if i had an allowance so i could pay for her shoes. she had asked me at the time if i was messing around and i said yes because i literally didn't know what else to say. after numerous emails from my mom to the teacher things finally cleared up and all was back to normal.**",After my mom emailed the teacher everything was resolved,playing basketball with friends,** i wanted vanilla cupcakes so i raised my hand and knocked a whole box of cupcakes all over my teacher.
"good lord, this happened four months ago and even thinking about it still exhausts me. i was taking a study abroad course in costa rica with other students from my college. we stayed with host families in san jose, the national capital, and took daily spanish classes at a local school. every day after class, we would go on excursions with instructors from our college to places like museums and monuments. one day we saw a musical performance at the *teatro nacional*. it was still early in the afternoon when it was over, so we were all free to go shopping, get something to eat, or go home. now, up to this point i had usually stuck with whatever group was going to go somewhere interesting, but after a week of arguing and rushing around to places that i didn't really care about, i decided to explore the city by myself. the theatre was very close to our school, so i knew how to get around the area. i took this time to go to places that i had been wanting to see, especially chinatown (yes, san jose of all places has a chinatown.) i browsed a few shops but didn't buy much, and i concluded my adventure by having a smoothie at an ice cream shop. afterwards, i made my way toward *parque central*, which was my reference point for getting to the homebound bus. i retraced my steps to get back where i wanted to be, and it seemed like i was doing okay until i didn't recognize the shops around me. i backtracked and turned a different corner. nope, in still didn't recognize anything. this happened several times. i was starting to get annoyed, but i thought that one more turn would get me where i needed to be. it look at least an hour, but i did indeed get to the park. then i needed to find my bus stop. once again, i turned corners and went down streets and still couldn't find where i needed to go. the infuriating part was that i was going in circles over and over and recognized everything around me, but i just couldn't remember which turns i was supposed to make. there came a point where passers-by could tell that i was walking in circles, and a girl pulled me aside and asked if i needed help. she barely spoke english and i barely spoke spanish, and she realized that she didn't understand anything that i was saying. she took me to a local bank where she knew there would be english-speakers, and i asked a man how to get to the *barrio pilar* bus stop. he spoke to the girl for a minute and she told me that it was exactly five blocks ahead. i thanked her as much as i could and did what she told. thankfully, the bus was right there. i thought my predicament was over, but then there was the matter of getting off at the right stop. all of the houses in the neighborhood started blending together, especially as it started getting dark. i was confused, because i suspected that i had passed my stop but i recognized some of the landmarks i was passing. i got off at the stop that i thought was closest to mine and started walking. i still had no idea where i was going, and i didn't want to use google maps because (a) my phone battery was under 10% and (b) international data usage was insanely expensive. once again i recognized my surroundings, but still couldn't seem to navigate. it was starting to get really dark, and i was starting to get really scared. the streets were insufficiently lit, and some streets weren't lit much at all. i once passed by a loud barking dog that frightened me so much that i nearly cried, which is a testament to how paranoid i was because i love dogs. my eyes and ears were on 360 mode, looking out for anything suspicious. any time i could see or hear another person approaching i would run in the opposite direction; it didn't matter who it was. it was late at night in a urban neighborhood, and i couldn't take any chances. i walked and walked and walked, desperately trying to remember where my host family's house was, but no matter what i did i just got more lost. i eventually gave up and used google maps, praying that my battery wouldn't die on me. to my great relief i finally found the house. my host mother wanted to know what in the world i was doing out and about at 11 pm, and i explained that i had just gotten very, very lost. i flopped onto my bed, incredibly thankful that i was somewhere safe. an interesting side note: i found out via an email from my psychiatrist a week later that i have inattentive adhd. that may have had something to do with it.","all of the houses in the neighborhood started blending together, especially as it started getting dark","I got lost in San Jose, Costa Rica, and had to use Google Maps to get home","i hate people so i wandered off by myself in the largest city in costa rica, got very lost, got help, then got very lost again. also, my phone was dead.**"
"i'm going to start off by saying that i hate birds. no particular reason why, they just give me the creeps. also, this happened yesterday.anyways, there's this beach by my house with a snack bar that serves things like ice cream, fries, hotdogs etc. on this day i was craving fries and gravy real bad. did i mention that the seagull population was surprisingly bigger than normal that day. i order my fries and immediately get the attention of the seagulls. i then grab a handful of fries and throw them as far away as possible to distract the seagulls so i can get away. here's where it gets bad. the fry toss may have distracted about 10 seagulls, there were still about 30 more. literally a tornado of seagulls started swarming me, getting about half a foot from my face. one seagull even ate fries right from the tray in my hand. here's where it gets funny. there's a park there with a bunch of kids and their parents. obviously i'm freaking out, i'm swearing, they're all laughing, i end up throwing my tray of fries, hitting a cloud of seagulls in the process and running away as fast as i can. terrible day.",The seagull population was bigger than normal on the day,"Seagulls swarmed me, getting half a foot from my face","bought french fries, attacked by  seagulls, got scared and started swearing next to a park, everyone was laughing at me, threw my fries and ran."
"this fuck up actually happened today, what a privilege it is to share it will all of you. first and foremost, i must say that i just recently mastered the art of cooking with a skillet. i'm about to graduate high school and was just recently released from the confines of only knowing how to construct and consume cold sandwiches. today, i had what you might call an intense craving for a quesadilla of my own design. i'm only available to cook quesadillas on weekends, so as you can imagine, i went all out: chicken, onions, spinach, three kinds of cheese, and ready to serve with salsa and guacamole. you know the old saying, ""good things come to those who wait?"" unfortunately, i didn't adhere that advice at 12:43 p.m. on saturday february 13th. i usually like my tortillas a little bit overdone so they are nice and crispy. hearing and smelling my delicious mexican cuisine simmering away in the skillet, i decided i was too hungry to wait for it to be well done, and decided to precede to flip it over. problem was, i couldn't find a spatula: so i used a fork. what proceeded could only be described as horrendous and heart-breaking.the prongs of the fork caught the tortilla at an awkward angle and opened it, gracefully dropping it face-down and spilling all the ingredients into the pan. had i waited longer for the cheese to melt, this could have been avoided. not wanting the cheese to melt into the pan (becoming harder to scrub off), i lifted the pan from the stove to put in the sink. in my haste, i tipped the pan sideways and spilled scalding-hot ingredients all over the floor and all over my nearby dog, coating him in the searing remnants of the wonderful goodness that was once a vessel through which the culinary soul could be moved. you know that feeling you get when you accidentally hurt your pet? yeah, i am shit. as my dog yelped i yelled, ""fuck!"" at the top of my lungs. normally i wouldn't use this kind of language in the household, but knowing my parents weren't home, i let her rip: or so i thought. turns out my dad was at the front door talking to our super conservative stain glassed ass neighbors, whom i heard audibly gasp from the kitchen. safe to say, i won't be getting fundraiser sales from them this year.oh, and i burned myself as well. all my ingredients gone, i had to settle for a cheese quesadilla instead. my dog now rolls over in fear every time i come near him. all for a quesadilla. a quesadilla. edit: dog is okay. just a little freaked out.","Today, I had what you might call an intense craving for a quesadilla of my own design","hearing and smelling my delicious mexican cuisine simmering away in the skillet, i decided i was too hungry to wait for it to be well done, and decided to precede to flip it over","tried to make a quesadilla, ended up burning my dog and disgracing my family in front of out fundamentalist neighbors."
"july 13th. hong kong departures terminal.she smiled at me on the transfer tram.  i pretended to be annoyed. tried to make contact with me on the escalator. i quickly glanced away.walked right up to me in the food court. i ignored her and didn’t even smile, acting like she wasn’t there.except i noticed her as soon as she entered my world. blue jacket wrapped around her waist, locks like a young michelle pfeiffer, smile lit up the darkest corners of my universe. i’m mid-20s with a world of experience and relationships, and i don't believe in soul mates, but i felt something i never felt before. she was making her way to an auckland, new zealand gate before i lost track of her and stopped pretending to ignore. i am writing this on the runway of a 2 hour delay on what’s to be a 13 hour flight feeling like a made a life mistake. planning to post this in a couple days if i still feel as strongly about her. would be lying if this wasn’t a hail mary to make a connection.","The protagonist met a girl at Hong Kong airport, and despite initial indifference, they quickly connected and the protagonist felt something they never felt before",I hope this post can help me connect with her or inspire others who have gone through similar experiences,; crossed paths with someone in the universe whose stardust created a strong chemical reaction with mine and i didn’t even get a name.
"tonight i (white male 20) decided to have a few drinks with friends (two white females 20/21) in my room and drive them up town in our college town to the clubs. no big deal. i do this all the time. it is getting time to leave and i decided to grab my car from the near by parking lot and pick up my friends at the door. on my way tot he lot i come up to a very intoxicated women (black and very underaged) in the grass struggling to put on her shoes. she has lost her phone and her keys but has had enough to drink she doesn't care one bit. i know that recent events in my college town, two women getting raped in the past three weeks, means it is not safe for me to just blow this off. i made a choice to help her back to her dorm and mostly make my friends late to the clubs up town. i struggle to get her to comply, but she agrees it is for the best for her to go home. in the process of taking her back to her dorm and attempting to be the stable anchor for her while she meanders in the general direction, i receive an infuriated call from my friends, demanding i bail on my new ward and accommodate the original plans. i explain the situation and they are having none of it. they leave without me to walk up to the club. after i successfully check the strange woman into her dorm, i attempt to meet my friends halfway and drive them the rest of the way. i park my car in a near by business, get out and try to explain in person the situation. again, they were having none of it. so now i am certain that my better judgement has cost me a preciously cherished friendship.",I decided to pick up my friends and drive them up town to the clubs,I am upset that my better judgement has cost me a cherished friendship,drunk bitches be tripping
"here's the skinny. i (28f) have somehow become the designated driver at our work. the business van is a [sprinter](http://www.mbvans.com/sprinter/home) with no side windows and i hate driving it. backing it up is stressful, but i don't tell my boss this.two days ago i had to pick up stuff from other greenhouses to bring back to ours. three destinations down and two more to go, at the fourth destination, the pickup area was this small area with short cement dividers. while trying to back up and turn at the same time, i hit the bumper on one of the dividers. ''tis but a scratch, nbd right, so i continue my duties for the day.later i had to get something from our production site before going out on the last drive of the day. one of my boss's have a dog on site who is terrible, she appears from no where, quickly getting behind and in front of moving vehicles, and letting her hound bark rip. i'm backing up and turning around, she shows up, i just happen to see her when she let's out her usual hound scream. i turn harder and hit the compost trailer. i get out to see if she and the sprinter our okay. she's perfectly fine because i dodged her but the damage to the sprinter bumper 'tis not but a scratch. i'm rattled. today is not going well. i stare down the dog who stops barking , feels my wrath, and leaves. i go off on my drive, in low spirits. pick up 15 glass panels from another greenhouse, bc a wind storm hecked up a part of our retail section. by this point in the day, it's 4:30pm, my shift ends at 4:30 and i run my own dog training business for which i have a training appoint scheduled for 5. on the drive home, i'm driving so carefully. speed limit or just below. a couple yards out from a green light, it turns yellow. sh*t,.. if i keep going i'm going to run a red. if i slow down to stop, i risk breaking the glass panels. i opt for not being hit running a red. i hear the glass slide out of position, first slowly, but they are picking up speed and making it's way to the back of my seat and *smash* into thousands of little pieces. the tears begin to roll.get back to work, tell my boss in  my boss and one coworker cleaned up the mess for me. i apologized the next day. i planned to clean it the following day since i got back to the greenhouse at 5 and we were done at 4:30.'tl:dr i fucked up by wrecking the work sprinter's bumper, narrowly miss running over my boss's dog, and smashing glass panels we needed to fix the gaping holes in the greenhouse wall.edit: was supposed to say ""crashing"" not ""rashing"" in the title...","The driver backed into a cement divider, causing a small scratch on the van's bumper",I wrecked the work sprinter's bumper,"format, ask to leave and just walk out."
"so for those of you who don't know, there is a google survey app for android you can download where you get to take surveys. after completing the surveys, you receive anywhere from $0.10 to $2.00 for doing a survey to use on the google play store. now with these surveys i have always lied. the more i'd fabricate these answers, the more ""valuable"" it makes my opinion. the more valuable my opinion is, the more surveys i get which means more play store credit. if i had been honest, i would not have gotten any surveys much like when i told my friend about the app and never got a survey after his first one. so far, i've received about $35 in play store credit by doing these surveys. so this morning, i got a google survey on my tablet. it was a 3 question survey. the survey asked if i had ever been to a water park called kelp water parks. i said yes. then it asked what my favorite slide was. i just chose a random name of a ride and proceeded to the next question.only then did i find out it wasn't a survey, but it was designed to fish out people like me. people who lie on their surveys. it told me that the kelp water park didn't exist. google then proceeded to scold me saying lying is a bad thing and it will most likely not consider me for future surveys. google caught me lying and left me feeling like i lied to my own father.",Providing false information increases the value of the survey respondent's opinion,I'm going on a trip to Europe with my family,lied to google. received a virtual spanking over their survey app.
"so we were going on a field trip to go see a play. we're traveling and traveling and everything is pretty boring since they told us not to bring our phones ( but i did anyway livin teh tuhg life ) and as we're all bored as fuck, we see some other buses. they were packed with fourth graders. so what are the jackasses in my school gonna do? make obscene gestures. we all start making vaginas with our fingers, shoving ""dicks"" in our mouths, writing curse words on the windows. their reactions were fucking great, they were screaming and we made one cry. we were having a hell of a time. their teachers were looking, trying to figure out who we were but even if they did, we didn't care. so this goes on for about fifteen more minutes and when one looks like they just got shot, someone says "" ian lick the window "" and of course being the dumbass i am, i did. three kids all yelled in unison ""mmmmm lick that shit"" it was great. until skip to now and i'm absolutely the sickest i've ever been, over the weekend i didn't really feel good, but now i feel destroyed. i can hardly breathe, my vision is blurry, my nose is runny, my throat itches and i'm vomiting like crazy.","Three kids yelled ""mmmmm lick that shit,"" and I vomited like crazy","One kid made a ""dick"" in their mouth",i licked a window and am now sick as a dog.
"i had braces many years ago so now i have a retainer, which i have affectionately dubbed my ""teeth"". today, i ordered food delivered to my apartment. before eating, i took my retainer out and wrapped it in a napkin, then happily dug in. by the time i finished my meal, i had forgotten about the retainer wrapped in napkin so i threw that into the box of leftover scraps, then chucked the box into my garbage.i was just now preparing for bed, brushing my teeth, when i reached for my retainer and found it...gone! that was when i remembered that i had thrown it out along with my lunch. luckily, my garbage was still in my bin so i fished it out, leftover scraps and all.","Luckily, my garbage was still in my bin so I fished it out, leftover scraps and all","Luckily, my garbage was still in my bin so i fished it out","i threw my ""teeth"" in the garbage, dug them back out, and brushed my teeth as well as my ""teeth"" before going to bed."
