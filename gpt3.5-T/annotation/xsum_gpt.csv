1,"They know him of old, of course, but for many this is a potentially new David Cameron, freshly elected with an unexpected majority.
Many leaders got rather irritated with the prime minister in the long lead up to the election. They felt he played too much to the Eurosceptic gallery at home when abroad on EU business.
Will this new David Cameron be a man they can work with, they wonder? They'd like to.
With the UK's in/out referendum EU on membership looming large in European headlines, most want to ensure Britain stays in, especially in Germany, as I found out earlier this week on a trip to Berlin.
The UK's former ambassador to Germany, Sir Peter Torry, describes the country as the best friend and ally the UK could have in its EU renegotiation.
Pretty useful for Mr Cameron, as Germany is Europe's most powerful nation.
There are very practical reasons why Germans are so keen to keep Britain in - and not just because they share a love for sausages and beer, as one student I chatted to suggested.
German businesses appreciate Britain's free trade, single market, and anti red-tape push. They see this as a counterweight to the EU's more protectionist, interventionist countries.
German taxpayers agree with the UK's drive to crack down on welfare claims by migrants. And Germany is very keen to avoid having to pay even more into the EU budget.
It would end up making up most of the shortfall if the UK walked away.
So there's lots of good will, but no blank cheque.
I asked German MP Michael Fuchs, of Angela Merkel's CDU party, how far the Chancellor would go to help Britain.
She'll offer ""utmost flexibility"", I was told, but there would also be red lines.
There is little appetite in Germany or anywhere outside Britain for fundamental changes to existing EU treaties (for example to curb the freedom of EU citizens to live and work where they like in the EU).
Though the suggestion has been made in several countries that when treaties are eventually changed to facilitate more harmony in the eurozone, that's when the UK could possibly have its own treaty-changing elements written in.
But the timing looks wrong for Britain.
German Finance Minister Wolgang Schaeuble says any treaty change is unlikely before the UK holds its EU referendum.
But there is a widespread hunger for EU change - from the north amongst the Scandinavian countries to Europe's southern reaches.
Governments realise that, with near deflation and high youth unemployment, especially in Spain, France and Italy, the EU is failing to live up to the aspirations of its almost half a billion citizens.
The question for Britain's prime minister is whether the change favoured by his European partners match the changes David Cameron wants?
Not all his European counterparts are prepared to be as open as Angela Merkel when it comes to UK requests.
Not everyone would be as regretful as Germany if the UK were to leave.
David Cameron has announced he will begin bilateral visits with his European colleagues as soon as this summit is over.
They expect concrete details on what exactly Britain wants from the EU by the leaders' next summit at the end of June.",EU leaders are curious to meet the British prime minister when he joins the Eastern Partnership Summit in Riga.,"European leaders are cautiously optimistic about working with the newly elected David Cameron, particularly in the context of the UK's upcoming EU referendum and potential renegotiation of membership terms",The new David Cameron is being carefully observed by European leaders as they assess whether he will be a cooperative partner in the UK's renegotiation of EU membership
2,"The body of Andraya Lyons, 39, was found in Drew Street, Swindon at 05:40 GMT on Saturday.
Anthony Porter, 32, has appeared before Swindon Magistrates' Court charged with murder.
Her family said: ""We are completely devastated to have lost Andraya... The past few days have been really difficult for us as a family.""
""She was a devoted mum to her boys and very much loved by all who knew her,"" they said.  Adding: ""We will always treasure the memories we have of Andraya.""

3,"The law also permits 12-year-olds to be contracted to work for others. But they need parental authorisation.
Vice-President Alvaro Garcia Linera said the new legislation reflects the needs of Bolivia, one of the poorest countries in South America.
It also sets harsher punishment for violence against children.
The law sets a sentence of 30 years in jail for child homicide.
The measure, approved by Congress earlier this month, was signed into law by Mr Garcia in the absence of President Evo Morales, who was travelling to Brazil.
""President Evo [Morales] intervened to make sure we found a balance between the reality and the law, between rights and international treaties,"" added Mr Garcia.
More than 500,000 children already work to supplement the family income in Bolivia according to the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef).
Many work cleaning shoes and selling food in stalls in La Paz and other Bolivian cities. But others face extreme conditions in mines and in agriculture fields.
Mr Morales's socialist government hopes the law will help eradicate extreme poverty in Bolivia.
The International Labour Organisation says children under the age of 15 should not be allowed to work.
But it allows a minimum working age of 14 for developing countries.
""It would have been easier to pass a law in line with international conventions, but it would not be enforced because Bolivia's reality has other needs and characteristics,"" said Mr Garcia.
The ILO says it is studying the legislation to decide whether it breaches international regulations on child labour.",Bolivia has lowered the legal working age to allow children to work from the age of 10 as long as they also attend school and are self-employed.,"Bolivia has passed new legislation allowing 12-year-olds to work with parental authorization, setting harsher punishments for violence against children, including a 30-year jail sentence for child homicide, in an effort to address the country's extreme poverty and unique needs","Bolivia has passed a new law allowing children as young as 10 to work, with parental authorization, in an effort to address extreme poverty in the country, despite potential violation of international child labor regulations"

5,"The FTSE 100 index rose 77 points, or 1.1%, to 6,911.4, with similar rises seen elsewhere in Europe.
Most analysts had expected the Fed to hold rates on Wednesday, although the US central bank indicated rates could rise before the end of the year.
The dollar fell after US rates were held, which pushed commodity prices up.
That led to rises in shares of mining companies, as the price of copper hit a one-month high and other metal prices increased.
Shares in Glencore and Fresnillo led the FTSE 100 higher, with both seeing rises of more than 5%.
""Given the rise across the spectrum for commodities, it comes as no surprise that the FTSE leaderboard is headed by some of the biggest names in mining,"" said Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG.
In the FTSE 250, shares in Kier Group rose 1.3% after the construction group reported a 45% increase in underlying full-year pre-tax profits to Â£125m.

6,"The Scottish government said the review group would assess whether college and university students in Scotland receive fair and effective support.
Ms Gadhia, who has been chief executive officer of Virgin Money for nine years, will also make recommendations for improvements.
The group will report its findings in 12 months' time.
The review group will look at whether effective support is being provided for the poorest and most vulnerable students. It will also examine the current repayment threshold and period for student loan debt.
It is being carried out as part of the programme for government announced by Nicola Sturgeon in September.
Minister for Further Education Shirley-Anne Somerville said: ""With such strong financial experience, and already contributing to Scottish education as a member of the International Council of Education Advisers, Jayne-Anne will provide a fresh perspective to the work of the review.
""I look forward to the recommendations that the review group will offer.""
Ms Gadhia, who last year led a UK government review into women in finance, said: ""It is important to ensure the student support system is fit for purpose, fair and firmly focused on meeting the needs of all students in further and higher education, particularly the most vulnerable.
""As such, I welcome the opportunity to undertake a comprehensive review of the current systems of student support in Scotland.""
The review, which will be carried out jointly with universities and colleges, has been welcomed by Colleges Scotland.
Shona Struthers, the chief executive of Colleges Scotland, said: ""We want a standard and fair system for student support funding that provides students with adequate financial support, as well as reasonable certainty on the support they are likely to receive for the duration of their study.
""We fully support measures to improve student support funding to ensure that all students can attend college, regardless of their personal circumstances or background.""
The announcement was made as figures from the Student Awards Agency Scotland (SAAS) showed the number of students being paid grants across Scotland fell by 4.8% on last year as an increasing number take out loans.
However, the total cost being spent on grants increased by 3.9% - from £63.6m in 2014-2015 to £66.1m in 2015-2016, according to the SAAS report.
The number of students taking out loans rose during the same period by 3.4% to 92,005 and the total authorised in loans was £486.3m, a 3.7% increase.
The average loan per student in 2015/16 was £5,290, up £20 on the previous year.
Scottish Conservative education spokeswoman Liz Smith said: ""These are hugely worrying figures, and show that the SNP has slashed bursary support in recent years.
""At a time when we should be doing all we can to close Scotland's attainment gap, the SNP has chosen to cut the money given to those who need it most.
""Bursaries are designed to help students get their foot in the door but this is becoming increasingly hard, and it's those in our poorest communities who are missing out.""
Scottish Labour education spokesman Iain Gray said: ""Figures released today show that almost 20,000 fewer students are receiving grants and bursaries than at the beginning of the last parliament.
""Meanwhile student debt - which the SNP came to power promising to abolish - has soared under the SNP government.
""Labour supports free tuition but students need the financial support to get through university when they get there. Instead the SNP has slashed bursaries and ballooned debt.""",Virgin Money boss Jayne-Anne Gadhia has been appointed to review the student support system in Scotland.,"The Scottish government has appointed a review group led by Jayne-Anne Gadhia to assess and make recommendations for improving student support systems in colleges and universities, focusing on fairness and effectiveness","The Scottish government has formed a review group, led by former Virgin Money CEO Jayne-Anne Gadhia, to assess the effectiveness of student support systems in Scotland and make recommendations for improvement"
7,"It has also been told to stop breeding orcas in captivity in a ruling from the California Coastal Commission.
They gave the park permission to double the size of its orca enclosures on the condition that breeding and bringing in new whales stopped.
It comes after criticism of the way the whales are treated there, something SeaWorld has always rejected.
Animal rights activists have welcomed a ruling by the California Coastal Commission, an agency that makes big decisions on major building projects in that area of America.
SeaWorld had put in plans to spend $100m (Â£65m) to expand its orca facility, which the commission approved.
But their decision came with several conditions. SeaWorld cannot add any new whales from the wild to its San Diego tanks, and none of the 11 orcas currently at the park will be allowed to breed there.
SeaWorld said it was disappointed with the ruling. They issued a statement that said: ""Breeding is a natural, fundamental and important part of an animal's life and depriving a social animal of the right to reproduce is inhumane.""
Groups that have criticised the park said they were pleased with the decision.
The group, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, said: ""The commission's action ensures that no more orcas will be condemned to a nonlife of loneliness, deprivation and misery.""
The breeding ban will not apply to the 13 other whales at SeaWorld attractions in San Antonio and Orlando.","SeaWorld has been banned from bringing wild killer whales to its park in San Diego, America.",The California Coastal Commission ruled that SeaWorld must stop breeding orcas in captivity and bringing in new whales in order to double the size of its orca enclosures,"The California Coastal Commission has ordered SeaWorld to stop breeding orcas in captivity and bringing in new whales as a condition for expanding their orca enclosures, a decision welcomed by animal rights activists"
8,"BBC Sport takes a look at five things you might have missed in the EFL on the last full match day before the festive season.
There were six late winning goals in the Championship on Saturday, all with ramifications in the race for promotion and the bid to avoid relegation.
Brighton's Glenn Murray headed home in the fifth minute of stoppage time against Birmingham City to ensure the Seagulls will spend Christmas eight points clear of third-placed Reading.
Jaap Stam's men had looked like having to settle for a point at Blackburn before George Evans hit an injury-time winner to move them back up to third.
Yorkshire rivals Leeds and Sheffield Wednesday ensured they would spend Christmas in the top six thanks to winners in the 89th minute and stoppage time against Brentford and Rotherham respectively.
Meanwhile, 23rd-placed Wigan were set to take a point from their home game against Ipswich before David McGoldrick popped up with an 88th-minute winner for Mick McCarthy's men.
Match of the day in the second tier must go to Barnsley's 4-3 win at Cardiff. The Bluebirds led in the third minute before trailing 3-1 at half-time.
Peter Whittingham and Antony Pilkington's 89th-minute strike seemed to have given Neil Warnock's side an unlikely point but Ryan Williams scored in the fifth minute of injury time to make it a happy journey back to South Yorkshire for the Tykes.
Well, maybe not quite miracles but it's probably fair to say neither Wes Brown nor Isaiah Osbourne would have been fancied by many to get on the scoresheet today.
Former Manchester United and Sunderland man Brown, 37, scored on his Blackburn Rovers debut to level the match against the Royals.
It counted for nothing in the end thanks to Reading's late winner but it was Brown's first goal since netting for Sunderland in December 2011.
Walsall midfielder Osbourne only had to wait a shade over three years to end his scoring drought.
The ex-Aston Villa player opened his account for the Saddlers to give them a point against Bradford City.
He'll probably be pleased this goal meant a little more than his last one which opened the scoring for Blackpool against Derby in December 2013. The Rams went on to win 5-1.
Yeovil boss Darren Way, assistant Terry Skiverton and the 18-strong match-day squad put £300 behind the bar at Carlisle as a 'thank you' to fans for making the long trek north.
""Special mention must go to the supporters because how far they've travelled to watch this game is unbelievable commitment,"" Way told BBC Somerset.
""This is beyond the end of the Earth. I just hope they feel that the players gave everything and they can be proud of their team.""
Travelling Glovers fans certainly seemed appreciative as they tweeted the club with pictures of pies and pints.
Sadly for the 96 Yeovil fans who made the 660-mile round trip to Brunton Park, the hosts were not in such a generous mood, with the Cumbrians claiming a 2-1 win.
Roll the clock back to 27 September and Bury are celebrating their sixth league win of the season and sit second in League One.
The following 16 games have brought a sum total of zero victories and the Shakers have slumped into the relegation zone.
David Flitcroft was sacked after presiding over seven consecutive league defeats but replacement Chris Brass, given the job until the end of the season on Thursday, has fared little better, losing his first five matches.
Bury twice took the lead at home to Oxford on Saturday but were pegged back on each occasion by a Chris Maguire free-kick before a Greg Leigh own goal gave the U's victory.
""We've got to dig in and fight a little bit harder than we are right now to keep the ball out of the net,"" Brass told BBC Radio Manchester.
It's been a tough start to the season for Exeter City and their match-going regulars.
Going into today's game against Mansfield, the Grecians had claimed a healthy seven wins away from home but were the only team in the EFL yet to taste success on their own turf.
Paul Tisdale's side ended their wait for a win at St James Park, which dated back to April, with a 2-0 win over the Stags thanks to a double from Ollie Watkins.
""I'm delighted,"" Tisdale told BBC Radio Devon. ""It had to come at some point and we did it today. It was hard work and the boys have deserved it against a really strong team.
""They put us under pressure in the second half and in many respects outplayed us but we stuck to it and 2-0 is a great feeling.""

Lewis, 24, featured eight times in the T20 Blast this summer and McKay, 20, deputised for wicketkeeper Tim Ambrose.
