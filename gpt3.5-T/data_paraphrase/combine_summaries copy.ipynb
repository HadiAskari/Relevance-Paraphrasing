       "['well this was around 9 years ago when i was a 2nd grader. so basically it was some kids birthday and since it was primary school most kids brought cupcakes and the teacher would pass it out to the class. me being the hungry little shit that i was i was desperately in the mood for some vanilla cupcakes but the teacher decided to pass out the chocolate ones first. \\n\\nafter she had finished passing out the chocolate ones she picks up the vanilla ones and says, \"raise your hand if you want vanilla!\". at that moment i was talking to a friend and it took me a bit to process the fact that she just asked who wanted vanilla. i proceed to raise my hand and it turns out the cupcakes were right above me. i knocked the cupcakes out of her hand and they spilled  all over her. she got bat-shit angry and begins to make a scene in the middle of the whole cafeteria. she explained how i \"ruined her brand new shoes\" and the bitch even asked me if i had an allowance so i could pay for her shoes. \\n\\nshe had asked me at the time if i was messing around and i said yes because i literally didn\\'t know what else to say. after numerous emails from my mom to the teacher things finally cleared up and all was back to normal.\\n\\n**',\n",
       " \"this was a few months ago when i had just sort of received my learner's permit after getting like 98% or something on the test and had just started driving my manual car. this is going to be difficult to explain without making myself look stupid, but anyway: i was driving down station street with my dad supervising in the passenger seat and we're quietly chatting about all manner of nonsense as i trundle along at about 60km/h when suddenly a fire truck comes right up behind us, sirens blaring and travelling at at least 80, so my dad explains that i should pull as far to the left as i safely can to let them through, so i cautiously guide my car into the bike lane, making sure i won't kill any cyclists in the process. the fire truck safely screams pass and i pull back out onto the road. i get into the town of chelsea and go through the lights at the 4-way intersection. i'm halfway to the next street corner when i spot another fire truck in the distance coming head-on towards me. now, from the start i've got no idea where the fire is and where the fire truck wants to go. so i go across past the side street and this fire truck starts veering over into my lane, which has had its width severely reduced by the cars parked along the corner in front of the pizza shop and all i can see is this huge truck flashing its lights at me as it tries to go through my lane to get into the side street, my dad pushing himself down into his seat bracing for impact and the cars parked next to me. all i can hear is my dad screaming 'woah, woah, woah! woah! woah woah woah' in my left ear and the fire truck's sirens and horn in my right ear. i continue through at the same speed gripping the steering wheel like my life depends on it, concentrating very hard on not crashing into anything. i get past everything and go around the corner that made this entire situation much more complicated than it would have been on a straight road. the rest of the drive is my dad freaking out at me and telling me i was millimetres away from the parked cars. within a week though, he was much more relaxed about the whole event and let me back out on the roads again.\",\n",
       " \"good lord, this happened four months ago and even thinking about it still exhausts me. \\n\\ni was taking a study abroad course in costa rica with other students from my college. we stayed with host families in san jose, the national capital, and took daily spanish classes at a local school. every day after class, we would go on excursions with instructors from our college to places like museums and monuments. \\n\\none day we saw a musical performance at the *teatro nacional*. it was still early in the afternoon when it was over, so we were all free to go shopping, get something to eat, or go home. now, up to this point i had usually stuck with whatever group was going to go somewhere interesting, but after a week of arguing and rushing around to places that i didn't really care about, i decided to explore the city by myself. \\n\\nthe theatre was very close to our school, so i knew how to get around the area. i took this time to go to places that i had been wanting to see, especially chinatown (yes, san jose of all places has a chinatown.) i browsed a few shops but didn't buy much, and i concluded my adventure by having a smoothie at an ice cream shop. afterwards, i made my way toward *parque central*, which was my reference point for getting to the homebound bus. i retraced my steps to get back where i wanted to be, and it seemed like i was doing okay until i didn't recognize the shops around me. i backtracked and turned a different corner. nope, in still didn't recognize anything. this happened several times. i was starting to get annoyed, but i thought that one more turn would get me where i needed to be. it look at least an hour, but i did indeed get to the park. then i needed to find my bus stop. \\n\\nonce again, i turned corners and went down streets and still couldn't find where i needed to go. the infuriating part was that i was going in circles over and over and recognized everything around me, but i just couldn't remember which turns i was supposed to make. there came a point where passers-by could tell that i was walking in circles, and a girl pulled me aside and asked if i needed help. she barely spoke english and i barely spoke spanish, and she realized that she didn't understand anything that i was saying. she took me to a local bank where she knew there would be english-speakers, and i asked a man how to get to the *barrio pilar* bus stop. he spoke to the girl for a minute and she told me that it was exactly five blocks ahead. i thanked her as much as i could and did what she told. thankfully, the bus was right there. \\n\\ni thought my predicament was over, but then there was the matter of getting off at the right stop. all of the houses in the neighborhood started blending together, especially as it started getting dark. i was confused, because i suspected that i had passed my stop but i recognized some of the landmarks i was passing. i got off at the stop that i thought was closest to mine and started walking. i still had no idea where i was going, and i didn't want to use google maps because (a) my phone battery was under 10% and (b) international data usage was insanely expensive. once again i recognized my surroundings, but still couldn't seem to navigate. it was starting to get really dark, and i was starting to get really scared. the streets were insufficiently lit, and some streets weren't lit much at all. i once passed by a loud barking dog that frightened me so much that i nearly cried, which is a testament to how paranoid i was because i love dogs. my eyes and ears were on 360 mode, looking out for anything suspicious. any time i could see or hear another person approaching i would run in the opposite direction; it didn't matter who it was. it was late at night in a urban neighborhood, and i couldn't take any chances. i walked and walked and walked, desperately trying to remember where my host family's house was, but no matter what i did i just got more lost. i eventually gave up and used google maps, praying that my battery wouldn't die on me. \\n\\nto my great relief i finally found the house. my host mother wanted to know what in the world i was doing out and about at 11 pm, and i explained that i had just gotten very, very lost. i flopped onto my bed, incredibly thankful that i was somewhere safe. \\n\\nan interesting side note: i found out via an email from my psychiatrist a week later that i have inattentive adhd. that may have had something to do with it.\",\n",
       " \"i'm going to start off by saying that i hate birds. no particular reason why, they just give me the creeps. also, this happened yesterday.\\n\\nanyways, there's this beach by my house with a snack bar that serves things like ice cream, fries, hotdogs etc. on this day i was craving fries and gravy real bad. did i mention that the seagull population was surprisingly bigger than normal that day. \\n\\ni order my fries and immediately get the attention of the seagulls. i then grab a handful of fries and throw them as far away as possible to distract the seagulls so i can get away. here's where it gets bad. the fry toss may have distracted about 10 seagulls, there were still about 30 more. literally a tornado of seagulls started swarming me, getting about half a foot from my face. one seagull even ate fries right from the tray in my hand. \\n\\nhere's where it gets funny. there's a park there with a bunch of kids and their parents. obviously i'm freaking out, i'm swearing, they're all laughing, i end up throwing my tray of fries, hitting a cloud of seagulls in the process and running away as fast as i can. terrible day.\",\n",
       " 'this fuck up actually happened today, what a privilege it is to share it will all of you. \\n\\nfirst and foremost, i must say that i just recently mastered the art of cooking with a skillet. i\\'m about to graduate high school and was just recently released from the confines of only knowing how to construct and consume cold sandwiches. \\n\\ntoday, i had what you might call an intense craving for a quesadilla of my own design. i\\'m only available to cook quesadillas on weekends, so as you can imagine, i went all out: chicken, onions, spinach, three kinds of cheese, and ready to serve with salsa and guacamole. you know the old saying, \"good things come to those who wait?\" unfortunately, i didn\\'t adhere that advice at 12:43 p.m. on saturday february 13th. \\n\\ni usually like my tortillas a little bit overdone so they are nice and crispy. hearing and smelling my delicious mexican cuisine simmering away in the skillet, i decided i was too hungry to wait for it to be well done, and decided to precede to flip it over. problem was, i couldn\\'t find a spatula: so i used a fork. what proceeded could only be described as horrendous and heart-breaking.\\n\\nthe prongs of the fork caught the tortilla at an awkward angle and opened it, gracefully dropping it face-down and spilling all the ingredients into the pan. had i waited longer for the cheese to melt, this could have been avoided. not wanting the cheese to melt into the pan (becoming harder to scrub off), i lifted the pan from the stove to put in the sink. in my haste, i tipped the pan sideways and spilled scalding-hot ingredients all over the floor and all over my nearby dog, coating him in the searing remnants of the wonderful goodness that was once a vessel through which the culinary soul could be moved. you know that feeling you get when you accidentally hurt your pet? yeah, i am shit. \\n\\nas my dog yelped i yelled, \"fuck!\" at the top of my lungs. normally i wouldn\\'t use this kind of language in the household, but knowing my parents weren\\'t home, i let her rip: or so i thought. turns out my dad was at the front door talking to our super conservative stain glassed ass neighbors, whom i heard audibly gasp from the kitchen. safe to say, i won\\'t be getting fundraiser sales from them this year.\\n\\noh, and i burned myself as well. \\n\\nall my ingredients gone, i had to settle for a cheese quesadilla instead. my dog now rolls over in fear every time i come near him. all for a quesadilla. a quesadilla. \\n\\nedit: dog is okay. just a little freaked out.',\n",
