0,"as it is for most tifus, this didn’t happen today, but this past weekend.

it was the final night of a production of a play i was acting in, and my fellow cast members and i were hanging out before the show. we were all goofing around, making jokes and just generally having a good time. i’d been under a lot of stress recently, what with school and the play and whatnot, so hanging out and chatting was a much-needed rest from everything. i mean, i *really* needed to de-stress, because i was starting to get to the point where i felt like i could snap if things got any more stressful. 

while i can almost always keep enough of a hold on myself and control my anger and/or frustration in times like these, sometimes my stress levels exceed my ability to keep calm. when this happens, instead of letting it simmer until i’m alone and able to safely release my stress, i explode in a hulk-like rage that will not subside until my stress is sufficiently released.

returning to the story, i was on the brink of a stress explosion that night, and the opportunity to relax was a welcome one. then, of course, just as i was starting to settle into a state of calmness, one of the cast inadvertently made a comment that made me feel unwelcome to the conversation. this sent me back to a few years ago, when i always felt like i was excluded from groups. i got frustrated with him and everyone, and started going on about how i’m always excluded from everything by everyone, yada yada yada. (i wasn’t, but i didn’t feel that way right then).

as i’m ranting very loudly at these people, i feel the need to physically release my stress. one of my peers was a couple feet away from me, trying to talk me through the whole thing and calm me down. i’m not stupid enough to actually hurt anyone, because that would go horribly for me in the long run. so instead, i turn and punch the nearest object as hard as i can. that object happened to be a big metal door (i was standing in the doorway at the time). 

what happened in that moment is kind of a blur, so i have no memory of exactly what happened in those few seconds before i punched the door. my experience was that one second i was pissed and the next i was in a lot of pain. as soon as i felt the pain in my hand, i was hyper-alert of the situation, probably because of all the adrenaline suddenly coursing through my body.

running on this insane adrenaline high, i’m holding my injured hand with the other, immediately regretting this, and the guy who was trying to calm me down asks if i’m okay. at this point, i’m not angry or anything — the only thing on my mind is dealing with my injured hand, so what i manage to get out is a shaky, “yeah, could someone get me some ice?”

so as they’re all scrambling to find me some ice, i’m just standing there holding my hand and trying to process the whole thing, which i do by making shitty jokes about it. so not only am i in pain, i’m forcing myself to laugh and make jokes through the pain, which probably makes me look like i’d gone crazy or something. then they tell me that there’s no ice, so the best i can do is run some cold water over it. i walk over to the dressing room, which has a faucet, but then my vision starts to get fuzzy from the pain of what i now realize is very possibly a broken hand. i lie down on the floor so i don’t fall in case i pass out from the pain, since that’s something that’s happened to me before. a minute or so later, i’m ready to get back up, so i go and get the cold water running. that’s fine and all, but my hand still hurts like hell when i go back to the group, and i’m still forcing myself to laugh and smile like madman. at this point, i’m pretty sure they’re quite concerned for both my physical and mental health.

so they’re still asking me if i’m okay, and i tell them that i’d be surprised if my hand is fully intact, but other than that, i’m fine. they tell me that i should go to a doctor or something, but we have to put on a show in half an hour, so i tell them that the doctor can wait. then i notice the dent in the door that is the exact size and shape of the part of my hand that hit it, and i realize just how hard i punched the door.

so now, not only am i in pain, but i have to get through the next couple of hours with a (maybe) broken hand. the whole time, i’m visibly tense and hurting, but still making jokes (and by jokes i mean laughing about how stupid the whole thing was and how my hand hurts a lot) and trying to look calm and happy, all of which probably made me look crazy.

so at this point i’ve yet to see a doctor or my fellow cast members since then, and now i’m pretty certain that they think i’m crazy or mentally unstable. especially because everyone was treating me very delicately for the rest of the evening, like they thought i might snap again.

1,"some background to this, i attended college in tennessee and finished around three years ago and joined the navy. while in college i met the girl of my dreams and we've been happily dating since my last year of school. she was a year behind me, so last year when she graduated she moved in with me and i proposed.

shortly after proposing i got orders to yokosuka, japan (which is what i wanted because i joined to travel). however, the military doesn't recognize fiancés as family so she was not able to move with me. there was lots of talking and me comforting her about me leaving, but luckily i should be back in the states next year. so we decided she should move home with her parents, work in the area to save some money, and use the time for planning our wedding next february.

so this is where i took a small prank too far, i waited until afternoon here (early morning april 1st for her) and messaged something saying ""we need to talk, it's about the ship"" knowing she wouldn't see it until she woke up. i then waited until around 6:00 a.m. her time and called. i went on to tell her that something came up and that we were doing a 6 month surge to the persian gulf and i wouldn't be home until august, 2016. she started being upset, asking if i was serious, and then began crying pretty hard when i said i was. once the crying started i felt bad and was about to tell her april fool's when she said ""i can't deal with this right now"" and ended the call. she didn't answer for nearly two hours and apparently wasn't checking her facebook messenger because by the time i got in touch with her she had already informed most of our families the wedding wasn't going to happen on time and was about to email the venue and reschedule (which costs around $1000).","made my fiancé cry, almost lost $1000, and had to tell my family that the wedding is still happening.","I proposed to my fiancé last year, then took a small prank too far and told her the ship would be home August of next year.", I went on to tell
2,"so a couple of friends and i were hanging out.  this one friend was the worst joker, i could have sworn he was a dad.  this was compared to me, who was always serious and often criticized as too blunt. 

well, he told one of his standard puns regarding his junk, to which we all groaned, and we all wanted him to stop.  my brain struggled between ""cut it out"" and ""knock it off"".  naturally, what came out was ""cut it off"".  

everyone looked at me in shock, half thinking i was serious.  i quickly tried to correct myself, but it was too late.  everyone but him realized my intentions and laughed it off, but i could only fake laugh with him smiling at me with the most deadpan stare i've ever seen.  

after that, no one could let that go, but nothing's been the same. shit, i just had a brain fart, but every hangout with that guy now seems forced.

3,"this happened last night ( saturday ) in tropicana at atlantic city. i just finished eating at hooters with my uncle, dad and brother and felt like i had to take a shit. i went up to the top casino floor which is the busiest i have ever seen and proceed to put down layers of toilet paper on the toilet seat. fast forward 20 minutes and i just cant let it out and start to feel constipated, i pull up my jeans, throw all the toilet paper in the toilet and flush. i walk out of the stall, wash my hands and proceed walking to the other side of the casino, back to the blackjack tables where my dad was. as im walking i realized alot of people especially the cute girls were looking at me and smiling. it was unusual becauase ive never had that many people smile at me at once. anyways i shrug it off and consider it my lucky night, i start heading towards a group of girls and as im walking for whatever reason i decide to pull my pants up and thats when i felt there was smething hanging from the back of my jeans. i grab it and rip it off and its a trail of toilet paper at least 2 feet long that has been hanging from the back of my jeans on a busy fucking night at a casino. i ripped it off, stared at them and the smiles turned into laughter, i do a 360 and started to run outside to the boardwalk and started heading towards ceasers casino where we booked a room ealier, called my dad and told him i wasnt feeling well and i'm going to sleep :(",i had toilet paper hanging out the back of my jeans while walking in a busy casino at night.,"Last night, Tropicana at Atlantic City, my Uncle, Dad, and I had dinner at Hooters.", He then proceeded to pull his pants up and discover toilet paper hanging from the back of his jeans
4,"so this didn't happen today, it happened last fall. i spent a friday afternoon raking leaves around my yard. i bagged them all up and loaded them in my van to take to my work's dumpster. i was lazy and didn't take the bags there right away, so they sat in my van all weekend. monday morning rolls around, and the increased temperature in the garage signaled to all of the spider eggs in the leaves to hatch, releasing thousands of tiny spiders all inside my van. for weeks afterwards i would have spiders crawling on me while driving, dropping down in front of my face and distracting me, it was awful. the only benefit of the spiders was that there were zero flies.","don't procrastinate, or you'll be plagued by spiders.","Raking leaves for a Friday afternoon in October, to bag them up and take them to the dumpster.", Spiders crawling on you or on your vehicle can lead to a distracting and unsettling experience
5,"to give some context.  earlier this year my mum had been diagnosed with bowel cancer.  with a few months left to live.  a deep shock to our entire family.  

onto the fuck up.  

today, after i had dinner at the hospital i had been asking to go home.  begging my dad.  i really hated staying at the hospital overnight.  the sound and smell just makes me feel uncomfortable.  hence, i wanted to go home.  my mum was doing fine, asleep but as far as i was concerned pretty stable.  

so i eventually push my dad into taking me home.  didn't think twice about it.  

at 12.30am past midnight my dad calls me saying my mum just passed away.  

i felt like shit.  i was meant to stay the night, spend the last seconds with her.  instead i was at home busy doing my own things.  

the regrets i have cannot be described by words.  my mum, the person who always was there for me.  the one who always supported me.  at the most desperate time she needed me i wasn't there.  

today i fucked up hard....",i let my own selfish desires take over instead of spending her last breath by her side.,to give some context.," I regret not being there for her, and being preoccupied with my own interests"

this fuckup happed 20 seconds ago...

15th of december. i am at work and hyped for star wars. we got midnight release tickets! fu... i mean force yeah ! until my boss entered the room and told me i have to work the night shift from the 16th to the 17th. fuck! i tried to protest but the force was strong with this one. well no midnight release for me. i sold the ticket (for three times the amount btw) and bought new tickets for monday because all the weekend shows were already sold out. i cried a little inside because i had to wait until monday. so today at work, i was talking to a coworker about cars and visual modifications. we ended up talking about spoilers. so it would be a good idea to look up some car spoilers. since you can find everything on reddit i typed:

7,"tifu majorly. this actually just happened to me about half an hour ago. excuse any formatting issues. i am on mobile at the moment, so be nice lol.

i do service directing at my church, which means handling quality control of the camera shots and managing the time clock for each specific segment. therefore, i have my own computer in the soundbooth to work from.

i was on vacation this past week, so my station was a bit messy. i threw away a couple of wrappers and noticed that my keyboard had lots of crumbs and dust in the keys, so i grabbed (what i thought was) the dust remover spray. now, in my defense, the soundbooth is pretty dim in the morning before people come in. so it's an honest mistake, right? yeah... anyways, that's where the fuck up happened. turns out i grabbed the wd-40 and sprayed it alll over my work computer's keyboard.

cue instant panicking and googling how the fuck to clean that off without damaging it further. it's clean now, but i'm hoping it's still plenty functional...",thought wd-40 was dust remover spray and fucked up my work computer's keyboard,This actually just happened to tifu while he was service directing at his church., This actually just happened to me about half an hour ago
8,"i'm a freshman (civil engineering). i started off by going to the lessons, but soon enough i convinced myself i could study all this stuff by myself  and i didn't need all these lessons. i do want to pass my exams ofcourse, and since they are coming up in exactly a month from now, i started checking the contents of my courses, also i have heard the last lessons each semester are the most important ones for several reasons.

so this one day - yesterday - i attended a whole day of school. the theory lesson of chemistry was over, i nearly understood it completely (feelsgoodman), next lesson is in 15 minutes. at this point, a cute girl randomly takes place next to me, i have nothing to do and nothing to lose, so i go for it.

start the chat with a casual ""hi"", seems she is hesitant about talking at first (shy or so idk), her name is ellen, tell her mine, small talk about school and think about asking her out. conversation goes way better than expected, she has humour and she's pretty smart too, we come at the point of talking about chemistry (next lesson is an exercise session). tell her i skip lessons ""now and then"", but i like chemistry and i ask her if she likes it too and maybe we can go out one night to continue what we were talking about.

at the point where i asked if she liked chemistry, she started looking weird at me. chat was done, she stood up and said: ""lesson is going to start. raise your hand if you need help, martin. it was martin, right?""...

>leave the auditorium, will check the exercises at home

9,"didn't happen today, but happened a week ago, i just got to posting it now. 
the weekend before i went away for college, i had a bunch of family over and a good amount of friends as a last get together. we all were having a good time playing volleyball and corn hole. my friend then offers using his fireworks that he keeps in the trunk of his car (stupid move, i know). they were’t the big type or anything. just little firecracker sized tubes that wind up like a helicopter, and shoot into the sky with a “zingggg!”. anyways, we started shooting them off in my driveway and then had some ideas of putting them in glass jars, beer bottles, water bottles, etc. it was all fun any games until we thought to put them in a cardboard box. that’s where it went wrong. 
the friend with the fireworks, lets call him phil, said he only had 3 packets left (6 in each package, a total of 18 twister sticks). we walk in to my garage finding anything else we would shoot them off in, and we come across this huge cardboard box. i recently got a new mini fridge for college, so the empty boy was laying around in the garage. we take the box and the 3 packages of twister sticks over in the culdesac next to my house. we put the box right in the middle, and put all the packages in the box. phil lights one of the twisters and we all run like hell away, not knowing what is going to happen when 18 of them go off at one time. we get cover behind a tree, as watch them violently shooting into the air, sideways, towards my house, neighbors house, every fucking direction you could imagine. after the mayhem, we start cheering and shit with each other, not noticing the cardboard box is fully engulfed in flames. it was the biggest fucking fire i have ever seen outside of a bonfire pit. it was gigantic. in a huge panic, i run inside to grab a fire extinguisher to put out the fire. i ran past my whole family inside, unaware of what is happening outside. i get back to the culdesac to see phil already putting the fire out with 2 water bottles.
 relieved that the blaze was put out, we start going back to my driveway to grab a shovel and clean up the mess. on the way back, i glance to my left to see my neighbors brand new chevy colorado parked on the street with its driver side wheel well on fire. i yell  “oh shit!”, that’s when phil looks over at the same situation. he grabs the fire extinguisher and runs over to the truck. at this point, my neighbor has been outside the entire time of us shooting all the fireworks. while phil is running over to put out the fire, my neighbor is unaware of the situation so he gets in his truck and moves it into his driveway, while the wheel well is on fire. (after the fact, i found out he moved it for us so we would have more room…) phil gets over there and sprays the wheel. to be honest, i expected him to be furious with the 6 teenage boys lighting off fireworks that caught his truck on fire. he was the complete opposite. he quickly checks where the fire was and inside the engine to look for what damage happen. he is a mechanic, so he knew what he was looking at. apparently, only the plastic wheel well mold melted, and no other wires or issues happened. thank god. this was a great way to speak with my neighbors for the first time ever since they moved in 2 years ago, by lighting their truck on fire.
he said he would order the part and contact us shortly to give us the price, only happened to be $56 bucks. not bad, but a terrifying experience.","lighting off fireworks, lit 18 at once inside a cardboard box, box lit on fire as well as neighbors brand new truck.","A weekend before college kid goes away, a bunch of family over, and a good amount of friends (we'll call them ""the gang"") play corn hole, and someone offers using fireworks in a car trunk."," My friend then offers using his fireworks that he keeps in the trunk of his car (stupid move, I know)"
