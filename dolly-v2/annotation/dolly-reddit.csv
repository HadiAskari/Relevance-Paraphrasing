"well this was around 9 years ago when i was a 2nd grader. so basically it was some kids birthday and since it was primary school most kids brought cupcakes and the teacher would pass it out to the class. me being the hungry little shit that i was i was desperately in the mood for some vanilla cupcakes but the teacher decided to pass out the chocolate ones first. after she had finished passing out the chocolate ones she picks up the vanilla ones and says, ""raise your hand if you want vanilla!"". at that moment i was talking to a friend and it took me a bit to process the fact that she just asked who wanted vanilla. i proceed to raise my hand and it turns out the cupcakes were right above me. i knocked the cupcakes out of her hand and they spilled  all over her. she got bat-shit angry and begins to make a scene in the middle of the whole cafeteria. she explained how i ""ruined her brand new shoes"" and the bitch even asked me if i had an allowance so i could pay for her shoes. she had asked me at the time if i was messing around and i said yes because i literally didn't know what else to say. after numerous emails from my mom to the teacher things finally cleared up and all was back to normal.**"," I accidentally knocked the cupcakes out of her hand, causing them to spill all over her",Well this was around 9 years ago when I was a 2nd grade.,** i wanted vanilla cupcakes so i raised my hand and knocked a whole box of cupcakes all over my teacher.
"this was a few months ago when i had just sort of received my learner's permit after getting like 98% or something on the test and had just started driving my manual car. this is going to be difficult to explain without making myself look stupid, but anyway: i was driving down station street with my dad supervising in the passenger seat and we're quietly chatting about all manner of nonsense as i trundle along at about 60km/h when suddenly a fire truck comes right up behind us, sirens blaring and travelling at at least 80, so my dad explains that i should pull as far to the left as i safely can to let them through, so i cautiously guide my car into the bike lane, making sure i won't kill any cyclists in the process. the fire truck safely screams pass and i pull back out onto the road. i get into the town of chelsea and go through the lights at the 4-way intersection. i'm halfway to the next street corner when i spot another fire truck in the distance coming head-on towards me. now, from the start i've got no idea where the fire is and where the fire truck wants to go. so i go across past the side street and this fire truck starts veering over into my lane, which has had its width severely reduced by the cars parked along the corner in front of the pizza shop and all i can see is this huge truck flashing its lights at me as it tries to go through my lane to get into the side street, my dad pushing himself down into his seat bracing for impact and the cars parked next to me. all i can hear is my dad screaming 'woah, woah, woah! woah! woah woah woah' in my left ear and the fire truck's sirens and horn in my right ear. i continue through at the same speed gripping the steering wheel like my life depends on it, concentrating very hard on not crashing into anything. i get past everything and go around the corner that made this entire situation much more complicated than it would have been on a straight road. the rest of the drive is my dad freaking out at me and telling me i was millimetres away from the parked cars. within a week though, he was much more relaxed about the whole event and let me back out on the roads again.", I got into the town of Chelsea and went through the lights at the 4-way intersection,"My dad was yelling ""woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah"" in my left ear and a fire truck was yelling and honking in my right ear as I was narrowly miss crashed into several parked cars due to the police officer directing me to pull over so the fire truck could pass.","i nearly crashed into some parked cars and a fire truck in chelsea in a bizarre situation that wasn't included on my driving test, probably due to it being incredibly specific."
"good lord, this happened four months ago and even thinking about it still exhausts me. i was taking a study abroad course in costa rica with other students from my college. we stayed with host families in san jose, the national capital, and took daily spanish classes at a local school. every day after class, we would go on excursions with instructors from our college to places like museums and monuments. one day we saw a musical performance at the *teatro nacional*. it was still early in the afternoon when it was over, so we were all free to go shopping, get something to eat, or go home. now, up to this point i had usually stuck with whatever group was going to go somewhere interesting, but after a week of arguing and rushing around to places that i didn't really care about, i decided to explore the city by myself. the theatre was very close to our school, so i knew how to get around the area. i took this time to go to places that i had been wanting to see, especially chinatown (yes, san jose of all places has a chinatown.) i browsed a few shops but didn't buy much, and i concluded my adventure by having a smoothie at an ice cream shop. afterwards, i made my way toward *parque central*, which was my reference point for getting to the homebound bus. i retraced my steps to get back where i wanted to be, and it seemed like i was doing okay until i didn't recognize the shops around me. i backtracked and turned a different corner. nope, in still didn't recognize anything. this happened several times. i was starting to get annoyed, but i thought that one more turn would get me where i needed to be. it look at least an hour, but i did indeed get to the park. then i needed to find my bus stop. once again, i turned corners and went down streets and still couldn't find where i needed to go. the infuriating part was that i was going in circles over and over and recognized everything around me, but i just couldn't remember which turns i was supposed to make. there came a point where passers-by could tell that i was walking in circles, and a girl pulled me aside and asked if i needed help. she barely spoke english and i barely spoke spanish, and she realized that she didn't understand anything that i was saying. she took me to a local bank where she knew there would be english-speakers, and i asked a man how to get to the *barrio pilar* bus stop. he spoke to the girl for a minute and she told me that it was exactly five blocks ahead. i thanked her as much as i could and did what she told. thankfully, the bus was right there. i thought my predicament was over, but then there was the matter of getting off at the right stop. all of the houses in the neighborhood started blending together, especially as it started getting dark. i was confused, because i suspected that i had passed my stop but i recognized some of the landmarks i was passing. i got off at the stop that i thought was closest to mine and started walking. i still had no idea where i was going, and i didn't want to use google maps because (a) my phone battery was under 10% and (b) international data usage was insanely expensive. once again i recognized my surroundings, but still couldn't seem to navigate. it was starting to get really dark, and i was starting to get really scared. the streets were insufficiently lit, and some streets weren't lit much at all. i once passed by a loud barking dog that frightened me so much that i nearly cried, which is a testament to how paranoid i was because i love dogs. my eyes and ears were on 360 mode, looking out for anything suspicious. any time i could see or hear another person approaching i would run in the opposite direction; it didn't matter who it was. it was late at night in a urban neighborhood, and i couldn't take any chances. i walked and walked and walked, desperately trying to remember where my host family's house was, but no matter what i did i just got more lost. i eventually gave up and used google maps, praying that my battery wouldn't die on me. to my great relief i finally found the house. my host mother wanted to know what in the world i was doing out and about at 11 pm, and i explained that i had just gotten very, very lost. i flopped onto my bed, incredibly thankful that i was somewhere safe. an interesting side note: i found out via an email from my psychiatrist a week later that i have inattentive adhd. that may have had something to do with it.", I had to Google Maps my way out of there,i was taking a study abroad course in costa rica with other students from my college.,"i hate people so i wandered off by myself in the largest city in costa rica, got very lost, got help, then got very lost again. also, my phone was dead.**"
"this fuck up actually happened today, what a privilege it is to share it will all of you. first and foremost, i must say that i just recently mastered the art of cooking with a skillet. i'm about to graduate high school and was just recently released from the confines of only knowing how to construct and consume cold sandwiches. today, i had what you might call an intense craving for a quesadilla of my own design. i'm only available to cook quesadillas on weekends, so as you can imagine, i went all out: chicken, onions, spinach, three kinds of cheese, and ready to serve with salsa and guacamole. you know the old saying, ""good things come to those who wait?"" unfortunately, i didn't adhere that advice at 12:43 p.m. on saturday february 13th. i usually like my tortillas a little bit overdone so they are nice and crispy. hearing and smelling my delicious mexican cuisine simmering away in the skillet, i decided i was too hungry to wait for it to be well done, and decided to precede to flip it over. problem was, i couldn't find a spatula: so i used a fork. what proceeded could only be described as horrendous and heart-breaking.the prongs of the fork caught the tortilla at an awkward angle and opened it, gracefully dropping it face-down and spilling all the ingredients into the pan. had i waited longer for the cheese to melt, this could have been avoided. not wanting the cheese to melt into the pan (becoming harder to scrub off), i lifted the pan from the stove to put in the sink. in my haste, i tipped the pan sideways and spilled scalding-hot ingredients all over the floor and all over my nearby dog, coating him in the searing remnants of the wonderful goodness that was once a vessel through which the culinary soul could be moved. you know that feeling you get when you accidentally hurt your pet? yeah, i am shit. as my dog yelped i yelled, ""fuck!"" at the top of my lungs. normally i wouldn't use this kind of language in the household, but knowing my parents weren't home, i let her rip: or so i thought. turns out my dad was at the front door talking to our super conservative stain glassed ass neighbors, whom i heard audibly gasp from the kitchen. safe to say, i won't be getting fundraiser sales from them this year.oh, and i burned myself as well. all my ingredients gone, i had to settle for a cheese quesadilla instead. my dog now rolls over in fear every time i come near him. all for a quesadilla. a quesadilla. edit: dog is okay. just a little freaked out.",This is a story about a sadistic mistake that occurred when cooking a quesadilla,this is a fun one.,"tried to make a quesadilla, ended up burning my dog and disgracing my family in front of out fundamentalist neighbors."
"july 13th. hong kong departures terminal.she smiled at me on the transfer tram.  i pretended to be annoyed. tried to make contact with me on the escalator. i quickly glanced away.walked right up to me in the food court. i ignored her and didn’t even smile, acting like she wasn’t there.except i noticed her as soon as she entered my world. blue jacket wrapped around her waist, locks like a young michelle pfeiffer, smile lit up the darkest corners of my universe. i’m mid-20s with a world of experience and relationships, and i don't believe in soul mates, but i felt something i never felt before. she was making her way to an auckland, new zealand gate before i lost track of her and stopped pretending to ignore. i am writing this on the runway of a 2 hour delay on what’s to be a 13 hour flight feeling like a made a life mistake. planning to post this in a couple days if i still feel as strongly about her. would be lying if this wasn’t a hail mary to make a connection.", The male passenger quickly avoids the female passenger and attempts to communicate with other passengers,"She smiled at me on the transfer Tram, but I pretended to be annoyed.",; crossed paths with someone in the universe whose stardust created a strong chemical reaction with mine and i didn’t even get a name.
"tonight i (white male 20) decided to have a few drinks with friends (two white females 20/21) in my room and drive them up town in our college town to the clubs. no big deal. i do this all the time. it is getting time to leave and i decided to grab my car from the near by parking lot and pick up my friends at the door. on my way tot he lot i come up to a very intoxicated women (black and very underaged) in the grass struggling to put on her shoes. she has lost her phone and her keys but has had enough to drink she doesn't care one bit. i know that recent events in my college town, two women getting raped in the past three weeks, means it is not safe for me to just blow this off. i made a choice to help her back to her dorm and mostly make my friends late to the clubs up town. i struggle to get her to comply, but she agrees it is for the best for her to go home. in the process of taking her back to her dorm and attempting to be the stable anchor for her while she meanders in the general direction, i receive an infuriated call from my friends, demanding i bail on my new ward and accommodate the original plans. i explain the situation and they are having none of it. they leave without me to walk up to the club. after i successfully check the strange woman into her dorm, i attempt to meet my friends halfway and drive them the rest of the way. i park my car in a near by business, get out and try to explain in person the situation. again, they were having none of it. so now i am certain that my better judgement has cost me a preciously cherished friendship.", I come across a very intoxicated women (black and underaged) in the grass struggling to put on her shoes,Tonight I had a few drinks with friends in my room and drove them up town to the clubs.,drunk bitches be tripping
"so for those of you who don't know, there is a google survey app for android you can download where you get to take surveys. after completing the surveys, you receive anywhere from $0.10 to $2.00 for doing a survey to use on the google play store. now with these surveys i have always lied. the more i'd fabricate these answers, the more ""valuable"" it makes my opinion. the more valuable my opinion is, the more surveys i get which means more play store credit. if i had been honest, i would not have gotten any surveys much like when i told my friend about the app and never got a survey after his first one. so far, i've received about $35 in play store credit by doing these surveys. so this morning, i got a google survey on my tablet. it was a 3 question survey. the survey asked if i had ever been to a water park called kelp water parks. i said yes. then it asked what my favorite slide was. i just chose a random name of a ride and proceeded to the next question.only then did i find out it wasn't a survey, but it was designed to fish out people like me. people who lie on their surveys. it told me that the kelp water park didn't exist. google then proceeded to scold me saying lying is a bad thing and it will most likely not consider me for future surveys. google caught me lying and left me feeling like i lied to my own father."," If I had been honest, I would not have gotten any surveys, much like when I told my friend about the app and never got a survey after his first one",People can use survey apps on their phones to get cash and play credit.,lied to google. received a virtual spanking over their survey app.
"so some background information about me. im generally a very stubborn person and very curious. (not a good combo).so i step onto the subway today as per usual routine. when i notice these 2 guys making really weird symbols with their hands. seeing as how they were teenagers i assumed they were trying to pretend to make some gang symbols or what not. so like the little curious fuck i am, i decide to ask them what they were doing. so i approach one of the guys with his head turned to me and im like "" hey man what were you two just doing there with your hands?"" he doesn't even move to look at me so i assume he was listening to his friend. so i politely ask again. this time when i get no response i get frustrated and shout ""are you fucking deaf!"" and storm off to go find a seat somewhere else that's when im approached by someone else who was watching this and he comes real close to me and says ever so calmly... "" they are actually deaf..""  and right then i put it all together.. they were signing to each other in sign language. without another word i get off at the next stop and wait for the next train.."," Since the boys were on a subway ride, they were curious as to why the two were making strange symbols with their hands","Sure, Jake and Scott were actually signing to each other in sign language without another word, which led Jake to realize that the two were deaf.","i yelled ""are you fucking deaf"" to deaf kids."
"technically this was yesterday but within 24 hours, so that still counts, right? my husband is allergic to dust. well, more specifically dust mite poop. so it falls on me to rid the house of dust via vacuuming, dusting, laundry, and whatever the hell else i can think of. he's still getting reactions, though, and he thinks it's because i can't reach all the way under the bed with the vacuum. it's not my fault he's tall and needs a king size bed but apparently it is my fault that i don't have go-go-gadget-arms. i've asked him a few times to help me move the bed away from the wall so i can vacuum  and suddenly he gets a genius idea that if we move the bed away from the wall, i can vacuum all the way under it! hmmm. of course it didn't help that he expressed the idea with quite a lot of persnicketyness and a snappy attitude. i thought i would avoid a fight by just going along with his brilliant addendum of tipping the bed frame on its side instead of just moving it to the other side of the room. i had reservations but i also wanted to get the damn thing over with. so he's crankily barking orders while tipping the thing up (sans mattress at this point) and i'm doing my best to keep up, starting to get cranky myself, when we hear a snap. the longways side plank broke off from the headboard on the side that i sleep on. now this frame is not simple in any meaning of the word. it has two rows of about fifteen thin bowed planks where the mattress sits and these fuckers were torture to get into their individual slots on both ends. now that the side plank has come unattached, these shits start slipping out too.it took us about an hour and a half and a dozen whispered fights (kid sleeping down the hall) to get the thing back together.  think it ends there? not today, satan!we get into bed, turn out the light, and the kid wakes up. i go settle her, get back in bed and ten or fifteen minutes later, she wakes up again. i settle her again, get back in bed, and i'm so worked up from the ordeal i can't sleep. she wakes again an hour later when i had just drifted off. husband sleeps through it so i go to her again. half asleep, i amble back to bed, settle in and start to drift when the world drops out beneath me. i have one fear in life. just one. falling. i'm not scared of snakes or spiders. i love heights but falling i just can't do so to go from almost asleep to falling- even the short distance of five inches or so- scared the mother flipping shit out of me. my heart was pounding, i couldn't catch my breath, i though i had just escaped death and it might come back for me. my husband said ""it's the bed. well that's annoying."" annoying? annoying?! i almost died!so we moved to the guest room and slept terribly. i've been shaky and emotional all day because of it but when husband realised how badly it effected me, he quadruple reenforced the bed so it's safe now. really wish i'd learn to trust my gut, though!"," So, it falls on me to rid the house of dust via vacuuming, dusting, laundry, and whatever the hell else I can think of","Technically this was yesterday, but within 24 hours, so that still counts, right?","i let my husband tip our bed frame over instead of moving it and it broke while i was trying to sleep in it, forcing me to experience my deep fear of falling."
