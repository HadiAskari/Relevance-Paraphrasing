      "A month ago, I just received my learner's permit and started driving my manual car. While driving down Station Street with my dad supervising, I accidentally drove into the bike lane to let a fire truck pass. The fire truck was travelling at least 80km/h and was trying to go through a narrow lane to access a side street. My dad told me to pull over to the left to let the fire truck through. I was scared that I would hit cyclists while driving in the bike lane, but I managed to guide my car into the bike lane safely. I was relieved when the fire truck safely passed by. I was about to turn the next corner when I spotted another fire truck heading towards me. I was worried that the truck would try to go through my lane, but I managed to stay in the right lane and the trucks safely passed by each other. I was relieved when I turned the next corner and my dad was not in the car with me. A week later, my dad was much more relaxed about the whole situation and let me drive again.\n"
