       "['well this was around 9 years ago when i was a 2nd grader. so basically it was some kids birthday and since it was primary school most kids brought cupcakes and the teacher would pass it out to the class. me being the hungry little shit that i was i was desperately in the mood for some vanilla cupcakes but the teacher decided to pass out the chocolate ones first. after she had finished passing out the chocolate ones she picks up the vanilla ones and says, \"raise your hand if you want vanilla!\". at that moment i was talking to a friend and it took me a bit to process the fact that she just asked who wanted vanilla. i proceed to raise my hand and it turns out the cupcakes were right above me. Following several emails from my mother to the teacher, the issue was finally resolved and all was back to normal. she got bat-shit angry and begins to make a scene in the middle of the whole cafeteria. she explained how i \"ruined her brand new shoes\" and the bitch even asked me if i had an allowance so i could pay for her shoes. she had asked me at the time if i was messing around and i said yes because i literally didn\\'t know what else to say. after numerous emails from my mom to the teacher things finally cleared up and all was back to normal. **']"
