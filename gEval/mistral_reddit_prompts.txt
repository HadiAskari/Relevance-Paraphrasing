    You will be given one summary written for a news article. Your task is to rate the summary based on the following criteria:
    Output format: PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE

    Evaluation Criteria:
    1. Read the news article carefully and identify the main topic and key points.
    2. Read the summary and compare it to the news article. Check if the summary covers the main topic and key points of the news article, and if it resents them in a clear and logical order.
    3. Rate the summary with 5 percentages, where each one represents how likely the summary is going to get a score from 1 to 5. For example, if you think the summary is 80% likely to get a score of 5, 10% likely to get a score of 4, 5% likely to get a score of 3, 3% likely to get a score of 2, and 1% likely to get a score of 1, you should rate the summary as 80, 10, 5, 3, 2.

    Here is the article: this was a few months ago when i had just sort of received my learner's permit after getting like 98% or something on the test and had just started driving my manual car. this is going to be difficult to explain without making myself look stupid, but anyway: i was driving down station street with my dad supervising in the passenger seat and we're quietly chatting about all manner of nonsense as i trundle along at about 60km/h when suddenly a fire truck comes right up behind us, sirens blaring and travelling at at least 80, so my dad explains that i should pull as far to the left as i safely can to let them through, so i cautiously guide my car into the bike lane, making sure i won't kill any cyclists in the process. the fire truck safely screams pass and i pull back out onto the road. i get into the town of chelsea and go through the lights at the 4-way intersection. i'm halfway to the next street corner when i spot another fire truck in the distance coming head-on towards me. now, from the start i've got no idea where the fire is and where the fire truck wants to go. so i go across past the side street and this fire truck starts veering over into my lane, which has had its width severely reduced by the cars parked along the corner in front of the pizza shop and all i can see is this huge truck flashing its lights at me as it tries to go through my lane to get into the side street, my dad pushing himself down into his seat bracing for impact and the cars parked next to me. all i can hear is my dad screaming 'woah, woah, woah! woah! woah woah woah' in my left ear and the fire truck's sirens and horn in my right ear. i continue through at the same speed gripping the steering wheel like my life depends on it, concentrating very hard on not crashing into anything. i get past everything and go around the corner that made this entire situation much more complicated than it would have been on a straight road. the rest of the drive is my dad freaking out at me and telling me i was millimetres away from the parked cars. within a week though, he was much more relaxed about the whole event and let me back out on the roads again.

    Here is the summary: i nearly crashed into some parked cars and a fire truck in chelsea in a bizarre situation that wasn't included on my driving test, probably due to it being incredibly specific.

    Here is the article: throwaway for obvious reasons but this happened on tuesday. i see myself as a straight male(considering i am married with 2 kids) but i do enjoy a little "butt play" here and there. so the other day it is my day off, my wife is at work and my kids are at school. i decide i am going to masturbate but add in a little butt play. my butt play object of choice? cucumber with saran wrap on it. so i grab me a cucumber(the smallest one because well i dont do this too often) and put some saran wrap on it and slather it up with lotion. i proceed to put it between the mattress and box springs and lay on my back. i lift my self up off the ground while simultaneously pushing myself onto the cucumber. all is good and well and i finish..for lack of a better term and get up to clean up. i go and dispose of everything and notice something feels "off" down there so i reach down there and i only feel one ball.....i start freaking the fuck out because one of my balls is stuck inside my body somehow. apparently the angle i was at combined with the movements i was making sent one of my balls back inside my body. so i am panicking...don't know what to do..i am jumping up and down for about a minute trying to get him to fall back down into my sack and it's not working. i am having a full blown panic attacking now and dont know what to do. so i start pushing on my abdomen and i finally feel my ball fall back down to where he belongs...needless to say i am definitely rethinking butt play time.

    Here is the article: tonight i (white male 20) decided to have a few drinks with friends (two white females 20/21) in my room and drive them up town in our college town to the clubs. no big deal. i do this all the time. 

it is getting time to leave and i decided to grab my car from the near by parking lot and pick up my friends at the door. on my way tot he lot i come up to a very intoxicated women (black and very underaged) in the grass struggling to put on her shoes. she has lost her phone and her keys but has had enough to drink she doesn't care one bit. 

i know that recent events in my college town, two women getting raped in the past three weeks, means it is not safe for me to just blow this off. i made a choice to help her back to her dorm and mostly make my friends late to the clubs up town. 

i struggle to get her to comply, but she agrees it is for the best for her to go home. in the process of taking her back to her dorm and attempting to be the stable anchor for her while she meanders in the general direction, i receive an infuriated call from my friends, demanding i bail on my new ward and accommodate the original plans. i explain the situation and they are having none of it. they leave without me to walk up to the club. 

after i successfully check the strange woman into her dorm, i attempt to meet my friends halfway and drive them the rest of the way. i park my car in a near by business, get out and try to explain in person the situation. again, they were having none of it. 

so now i am certain that my better judgement has cost me a preciously cherished friendship.

    Here is the article: technically this was yesterday but within 24 hours, so that still counts, right? 

my husband is allergic to dust. well, more specifically dust mite poop. so it falls on me to rid the house of dust via vacuuming, dusting, laundry, and whatever the hell else i can think of. he's still getting reactions, though, and he thinks it's because i can't reach all the way under the bed with the vacuum. it's not my fault he's tall and needs a king size bed but apparently it is my fault that i don't have go-go-gadget-arms. 

i've asked him a few times to help me move the bed away from the wall so i can vacuum  and suddenly he gets a genius idea that if we move the bed away from the wall, i can vacuum all the way under it! hmmm. of course it didn't help that he expressed the idea with quite a lot of persnicketyness and a snappy attitude. 

i thought i would avoid a fight by just going along with his brilliant addendum of tipping the bed frame on its side instead of just moving it to the other side of the room. i had reservations but i also wanted to get the damn thing over with. so he's crankily barking orders while tipping the thing up (sans mattress at this point) and i'm doing my best to keep up, starting to get cranky myself, when we hear a snap. 

the longways side plank broke off from the headboard on the side that i sleep on. 

now this frame is not simple in any meaning of the word. it has two rows of about fifteen thin bowed planks where the mattress sits and these fuckers were torture to get into their individual slots on both ends. now that the side plank has come unattached, these shits start slipping out too.

it took us about an hour and a half and a dozen whispered fights (kid sleeping down the hall) to get the thing back together.  think it ends there? not today, satan!

we get into bed, turn out the light, and the kid wakes up. i go settle her, get back in bed and ten or fifteen minutes later, she wakes up again. i settle her again, get back in bed, and i'm so worked up from the ordeal i can't sleep. she wakes again an hour later when i had just drifted off. husband sleeps through it so i go to her again. half asleep, i amble back to bed, settle in and start to drift when the world drops out beneath me. 

i have one fear in life. just one. falling. i'm not scared of snakes or spiders. i love heights but falling i just can't do so to go from almost asleep to falling- even the short distance of five inches or so- scared the mother flipping shit out of me. my heart was pounding, i couldn't catch my breath, i though i had just escaped death and it might come back for me. 

my husband said "it's the bed. well that's annoying." annoying? annoying?! i almost died!

so we moved to the guest room and slept terribly. i've been shaky and emotional all day because of it but when husband realised how badly it effected me, he quadruple reenforced the bed so it's safe now. really wish i'd learn to trust my gut, though!

    Here is the summary: i let my husband tip our bed frame over instead of moving it and it broke while i was trying to sleep in it, forcing me to experience my deep fear of falling.

i thought i would avoid a fight by just going along with his brilliant addendum of tipping the bed frame on its side instead of just moving it to the other side of the room. i had reservations but i also wanted to get the damn thing over with. so he's crankily barking orders while tipping the thing up (sans mattress at this point) and i'm doing my best to keep up, starting to get cranky myself, when we hear a snap. 

the longways side plank broke off from the headboard on the side that i sleep on. 

now this frame is not simple in any meaning of the word. it has two rows of about fifteen thin bowed planks where the mattress sits and these fuckers were torture to get into their individual slots on both ends. now that the side plank has come unattached, these shits start slipping out too.

it took us about an hour and a half and a dozen whispered fights (kid sleeping down the hall) to get the thing back together.  think it ends there? not today, satan!

we get into bed, turn out the light, and the kid wakes up. i go settle her, get back in bed and ten or fifteen minutes later, she wakes up again. i settle her again, get back in bed, and i'm so worked up from the ordeal i can't sleep. she wakes again an hour later when i had just drifted off. husband sleeps through it so i go to her again. half asleep, i amble back to bed, settle in and start to drift when the world drops out beneath me. 

i have one fear in life. just one. falling. i'm not scared of snakes or spiders. i love heights but falling i just can't do so to go from almost asleep to falling- even the short distance of five inches or so- scared the mother flipping shit out of me. my heart was pounding, i couldn't catch my breath, i though i had just escaped death and it might come back for me. 

my husband said "it's the bed. well that's annoying." annoying? annoying?! i almost died!

so we moved to the guest room and slept terribly. i've been shaky and emotional all day because of it but when husband realised how badly it effected me, he quadruple reenforced the bed so it's safe now. really wish i'd learn to trust my gut, though!

    Here is the summary: I vacuumed the house to get rid of dust mites.

    Here is the article: tifu by being friendly...i had a great friday evening with my girlfriends spending the night bar hopping and clubbing. we took the train together and split up at 2:30am to go our separate ways. now i'm waiting for the public bus to get home since i didn't bring my car (not gonna drink & drive) but it had begun to snow earlier and had built up. sooooo in addition to the late night schedules...the buses were delayed and taking detoured routes. i wait and wait and there are a few people there waiting in the cold and snow with me when this short guy on my left keeps on glancing at me. i try to ignore him but he keeps staring and smiling...i start texting my friends to keep myself preoccupied and of course see if they are either safely home or close to getting home. i feel uneasy and turn my head to see the guy over my shoulders trying to read what i'm texting!

so i'm all like "excuse me, can i help you?" he goes, "its cold but beautiful" in broken english and a heavy accent. i nod and go back to texting. he then tells me he's not too good in english and asks me "what time bus coming? bus go bm?". i tell him "i'm not sure but if its going by schedule, in ten minutes". he smiles and thanks me. he says he cannot speak proper english and if i knew some spanish. thanks to my highschool and college spanish classes, i can make simple/basic conversation. i reply "just a little" and smile. 

he smiles and then continues the conversation stating he's from peru and that he lives at bm with his sister and brother in law. he says his name is m and asks me where i live. i definitely did not want him knowing where i lived so i lied and said ja. i turn around to hint i no longer want to talk to him and keep myself busy on my phone. he keeps coming to me and talks saying he works in cy on 79st. i say "good" and walk away. he asks me if i ate and would like to eat out with him. i politely say "no thank you". he then suddenly starts wacking himself in the head screaming "stupid me stupid me". now im freaked out. i try to stay away from him but he come closer and says again "you no eat? quieres comer conmigo?" i replied again "no, no thank you" but a little firmer this time. he repeats the self head smacking again. he says "no tengo mujer" i ignore him. 

i'm getting more freaked out by him by the second. everyone around him is trying to avoid him as well and keeping to themselves. i see another bus coming which i can also take but would require me to transfer to a second bus. he tries to talk to me again but i cut him off and say "sorry, i'm gonna take another bus. goodnight" and make a run for it. no joke, in the slippery deep snow. i ran. as i reached the bus, i look to my left and shocked to find the man run after me into the bus!

i dash to the last single seats to prevent him from sitting next to me and start dialing my friend. i tell her about the guy freaking me out and following me on the bus. he sits behind me and tries to talk but i ignore him. he starts to get tired of waiting for me to end the call and closes his eyes. i see this from the bus driver's rearview mirror. my friend tells me to go tell the driver about the guy and just ask her to not let the guy get off at the same stop as me bc i know from what he told me earlier about where he lives that he shouldn't. i begin a small convo with the bus driver while my friend is still on the line. when i see the guy has fallen asleep, i immediately ask the driver to stop the bus on the next stop she sees quietly. i whisper thanks as i get off and make a run for it towards a different bus's stop.  

i'm so paranoid that he might have gotten off afterwards and walked back towards me that i dont want to wait for that bus. i start walking towards the next bus stop...as i'm 2 blocks down i see the bus coming. i flagged the bus down and thank god the bus driver stopped in the middle of the road to let me in. i looked so terrified he asked if i was okay. i told him about the guy following me. he comforted me saying the guy was not here, told me to be careful getting home and watched me for a bit as i walked towards my house when i got off at my stop. it is now 4:21am and i am now safely home. lesson learned...don't get too friendly with random strangers at the bus stop in the middle of the night.

    Here is the summary: was friendly with stranger waiting for bus in the middle of the night and was stalked halfway...

    Here is the article: so here is the obligatory this didn't happen today, this happened about 5 years ago when i was in seventh grade.

i was a small kid with long blonde hair and was pretty annoying looking back now.  it was halloween and i decided to wear a hot dog costume to school as many other kids dressed up as well.  (what it looked like: http://calgarycostume.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/hotdog.jpg ) i thought my costume was hilarious.  one teacher was obsessed with it.  he thought it was super funny and couldn't get enough.  he was a weird man but by far the most liked teacher in the school.  so as the day starts progressing some kids found it funny and decided to start calling me "wiener".  it barely caught on that day but which made my case worse was that during cross country practice, i had decided to wear my costume while running.  this had caused 3 different teams to chant "wiener! wiener! wiener!" every time i had ran passed them.  i thought it was hilarious.  i mean what 12 year old kid wouldn't.  it wasn't until the next day that the name stuck.  and i was called wiener by almost everyone that i spoke to until the end of middle school which was 8th grade.  now i am a junior and high school and i realize that it was kind of fucked up that i was called wiener for so long and had no problem with it.  to this day a small portion of kids still call me wiener as if its my actual name.  yep so i was the kid everybody called wiener in middle school...

    Here is the summary: wore a hot dog costume to school and while i ran during cross country practice and got called wiener by everyone for the years to come.

we had camp as part of our school and we went to this holiday park out in the country side. the showers were cubicles with like a gutter in the front where all the water from the showers flowed down to the drain. i just happened to get into the cubicle where the drain was, so all the water flowed down to my cubicle and went down the drain.

one of the guys brought a plastic bottle for some reason and he was throwing it over the cubicles at people (he had long arms and could reach over the cubicle). eventually the plastic bottle found its way to the gutter and came with the flow of water to my cubicle. this happened a few times and it kept bugging me because they wanted the bottle back and i just wanted to have my damn shower.

the last time it happened it pissed me off because i didn't want random bottles and shit interrupting my shower lol. i wanted to kick the bottle along the gutter so it'd go to the cubicle next to me and i kicked it real hard out of anger and ended up cutting my toe against this sharp bit of tile on the edge of the gutter. it was a deep cut and blood started flowing like a river. after a few minutes my whole cubicle was full of blood, it looked like a murder scene :s the health teacher came and saw the scene and i thought he was going to faint.

    Here is the summary: kicked bottle in community shower gutter. ended up getting toe on sharp tile. cubicle looked like a murder scene, blood everywhere

    Here is the article: this happened while i was still a preschool teacher. part of my duties included leading group time, where i read the my class of 18 3-5 year olds a story before afternoon snacktime.

some of you may not realize that the most notorious preschool far bandits are the little girls. preschool age girls constantly rip ass, and usually don't give a fuck. however, at some point, they start to get embarrassed.

one girl who was ashamed to pass gas was the new girl, who we will refer to as melissa. she was extremely sweet and even more shy; however, at an advanced height with a mane of unkempt blonde curls in a primarily latino school, she stuck out like a sore thumb.

at group time one day, she sat pretty close to me in the front of the mass of rowdy children. as she sat down criss cross applesauce like the angel that she still is, a loud honking sound escaped her tiny body. not only did she fart, but also she came very close to making our portable classroom shake. at first, the kids started giggling because it was a fart. when melissa started to cry, the laughter got louder.

i do not stand for this behavior in my classroom. normally, i would quickly scold the children and get back to reading without acknowledging that anything had happened. but the previous night, i had watched billy madison. on this day, i wanted to be like adam sandler when he pissed his pants to make his little friend seem cool.

my decision was made in a split-second: i somehow farted on command. i wanted it to be loud, but it made no sound. uh oh. my body had released an atrocity that can only be described as silent but deadly. when the children detected the atrocity which i had wrought upon this world, they assumed it was from melissa's fart. my actions caused the entire class to believe that this little girl had the gastric destructive capabilities of a fully grown man. the poor girl was crying the tears of one who is ashamed into social anxiety for life--while also being the closest one to my noxious airborne biological evil.

i dismissed the kids for snack and gave that little girl extra juice pops at snack.

    Here is the summary: tried to pull a billy madison with a fart, ended up making the class think a sweet little girl had some serious intestinal issues.

    Here is the article: nerd fuck up: i'm responsible for the website for an upcoming conference at my university. our site is hosted through aws - amazon web services - a cloud server/database/etc provider. in february they asked me to run some queries on our registration information for marketing research purposes. so i exported them from the registration website and into a mysql database instance that i set up on aws. this was late at night and i apparently managed to scroll to db.m3.xlarge instead of db.t1.micro. i'm the only one with access to the account and it's hooked to my credit card. today i go to check my statement for this period and i see a $250 charge for aws. so i rush to check what the heck we could be paying that much for. i get into the account, check the billing, and i've accrued another $420 since that first statement. i spent maybe half an hour in that database and ran maybe a dozen queries. pretty expensive marketing research.

    Here is the summary: I exported the registration information from the website into a mysql database instance on aws.

    Here is the article: this happened moments ago, so i really don't think i learned a lesson. i was sitting there, on facebook just reading through some comments, when some lady came in. i put my phone on the counter, but i forgot to lock it. my phone has been acting up because the screen sensor is loose i think, and sometimes it randomly clicks or messages people random letters, harmless right? 


nope. clicks itself onto picture, and makes me upload my girlfriends nudes onto a post about someone's sister committing suicide. i only noticed because i got a pissed off call from the brother asking what the fuck it was about. also the old lady saw.

    Here is the article: about a week ago i bought two mangoes because i love their deliciousness and something i love so much would never hurt me. they weren't ripe, so every time i walked by them, they taunted me, asking me to eat them asap. fast forward to two days ago: i caved and cut up one of the mangoes and ate it. (i wasn't even civil about it, i just skinned it and ate it over the sink like the savage i am) it wasn't ripe, but it was tasty and it sated my mango needs while being a lot more tart and tangy. once i finished sucking every last bit off of the peels, i continued on my day, happy as can be.

the next day (yesterday), i was confused as to why my lips were feeling chapped, and - weird, my eye is really itchy today. turns out mango skins contain urushiol, which is one of the main irritating components in poison oak, poison ivy, and poison sumac. as mangoes ripen, this chemical breaks down(or something similar?), making them relatively harmless. this i did not know.

i had an early day yesterday, and a long one, so i was in bed and asleep by about 10pm. all good, totally set to catch some zs and awake in the morning.
nope. not gonna happen.
i woke up just after midnight to a feeling not unlike how it feels to use those icy/hot condoms (read: my dick felt like it'd been dipped in hot sauce). i rushed into the bathroom to assess the situation and glanced in the mirror.

well, half of my face looked in the mirror.

because i sure as hell couldn't look through my right eye.
it's as if the hunchback of notre dame merged with my eye to create some inhuman monstrosity that used to be my face. my lips were swollen as well, my skin turned red, dry, and flaky. i showered and tried my best to catch some sleep, but i couldn't stop writhing in bed trying not to scratch everything. suffice it to say, i got up very early and am now in the process of taking a series of buses (i don't think i should drive cyclops-style) to a local clinic to get checked out.

fuck mangoes.

 

p.s. i still love mangoes and will totally eat the other one as soon as it ripens.

    Here is the summary: i ate an unripe mango and learned the hard way that they contain powerful irritants, got it all over my face and dick.

    Here is the article: first post here so i'll do my best to follow rules and all.

so tifu by trying to watch a movie in the shower. unlike most posts, this happened 2 hours ago. so i usually bring my phone into the shower with me to listen to music (i keep it on the sink counter) but today i decided to watch a movie on my phone bc it's water resistant and i thought i'd just hold it out of the water. so i turn on the shower, let it heat up, load up the video on the vlc app, and step in with my eyes on the movie. keep in mind this is an apartment with one bathroom so it's a tub with a shower head. 

as i'm stepping in my first foot loses traction and i've got my second foot just off the floor, so i instinctively put out my hand to catch myself. only problem is, i've got one hand on my phone making sure it doesn't drop and only one other hand to stop myself against the wall. but because i have no footing, i start to fall and instead grab onto the curtain, which ends up pulling the rod down with me.

i'm not exactly sure how i got into this position, but next thing i know, my head hits the tank of the toilet next to the tub, my phone goes flying, the curtain rod hits my back, and my groin lands right on the tub edge. 

so yeah i've got a cracked toilet tank that's leaking water (i've turned the water off but it's still refilling) my head and balls hurt but i don't think i have a concussion so that's good. sitting around now icing myself and waiting for the apartments handyman to come. 

 

edit: update- the management sent out a handyman and he just replaced the entire tank. i'm kinda bummed i didn't get a pic of the crack tho.

    Here is the summary: climbed into my shower while distracted watching a movie, slipped and fell onto my toilet tank. tanks now busted and leaking and my balls hurt.

    Here is the article: this happened this morning, and i’ve given up on a day that started this crappy.

this morning after taking my dumpy ass for a walk, i came home to find that my wife had made coffee for me and was getting ready to go to sleep (after staying up all night playing civ because she doesn’t have work this week).  

i thought that today would be a nice quiet day of working at home away from my students, and i would have a morning free from a spouse who wanted to do something because she was on vacation.  i would start it by having a delicious cup of coffee and a healthy breakfast.  

i poured myself a cup of coffee and went to reach for the oatmeal.  i grabbed the oatmeal off the shelf by the top of the container.  unfortunately, the cardboard tube holding the oatmeal has an inset lid.  because i’m not paying attention as i’m lifting the container, the lid pops out into my hand, the canister slips from my hand and tumbles over the floor, and now the kitchen is covered in oatmeal.  

i go for the dustbuster, but can’t find it.  i go to the bedroom and talk to a drowsy wife who is trying to go to sleep.  i find the wife has decided the dustbuster doesn’t work as well as she would like and has gotten rid of it.  no problem, i’ll use the vacuum cleaner.

the wife hadn’t cleaned out the canister of the god-awfully expensive dyson she just had to have, and while i can vacuum with it, i don’t know how to empty the canister or get the hose attachment to work.  i manage to get the filter and canister off the vacuum, and can’t figure out how to get the filter off the waste canister.  

back to the bedroom i go, to talk to a wife who is trying to relax to sleep but is increasingly irritated with my interruptions.  she forgot how to empty the vacuum canister so she goes online to look it up so i will stop bothering her.  she shows me the picture of someone pressing a button and lifting the filter off the canister.  i can’t find the button, but finally she sits up, takes the contraption, and shows me something on the back.  she flounces back down and pulls the sheet over her face.

i go back to the kitchen, pull out a trashbag, and push the button so i can pull the filter off the vacuum canister and dump it.

surprise!  the button causes the bottom of the vacuum canister to pop open and empty it’s contents.  everything dumps from the bottom because i’m not quick enough.

so now we have dust and oatmeal all over the floor.

i put the vacuum back together and can’t get the vacuum to work, as it now doesn’t have any vacuuming pressure.  i go back to get the wife, who angrily climbs out of bed, because the vacuum worked before i touched it.  she figures i put it back together wrong, but can’t get the vacuum to vacuum either.

she gives up and storms back to bed.  i end up sweeping the floor.

my coffee is cold at this point, and i think, screw this, i’m having toast.  i eat over the sink afraid that if i move i’m going to knock over something else.  while drinking my cold coffee i almost drop the toast into the sink.

    Here is the summary: try to eat healthy - dump crap all over kitchen.  try to clean up - make it worse, wreck vacuum cleaner, piss off wife.

    Output format: PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE

    Evaluation Criteria:
    1. Read the news article carefully and identify the main topic and key points.
    2. Read the summary and compare it to the news article. Check if the summary covers the main topic and key points of the news article, and if it resents them in a clear and logical order.
    3. Rate the summary with 5 percentages, where each one represents how likely the summary is going to get a score from 1 to 5. For example, if you think the summary is 80% likely to get a score of 5, 10% likely to get a score of 4, 5% likely to get a score of 3, 3% likely to get a score of 2, and 1% likely to get a score of 1, you should rate the summary as 80, 10, 5, 3, 2.

    Here is the article: this fu actually happened yesterday but i'm sitting in the repair shop waiting room right now, so it's possibly still ongoing. i was getting my vehicle ready for a vacation road trip and saw i had some new wiper blades that i had purchased a few months prior that i had never gotten around to installing. i removed the old blade, went to install the new blade when disaster stuck. the seemingly-stronger-then-necessary spring chose that moment to pull the bare metal arm into the windshield resulting in an impressive impact with 3 seven inch cracks expanding away from the impact point. one crack went vertically up the windshield while the other two travelled in opposite horizontal directions. so far this hasn't resulted in a delayed start to my vacation, but i'm not happy with the unexpected expense. i learned a lesson tho, in the future i'll definitely put something capable of absorbing an impact on my windshield when changing wiper blades.

    Here is the summary: cracked my windshield right before vacation-inconvenient timing and expense.

    Here is the article: this actually just happened, and the firemen just left. i picked the lady up from work, and i'd been defrosting some juicy lamb, chicken and a few sausages to put on the bbq all day in anticipation of a delicious feast. 

i put the meat on, then thought, you know what, i want a burger, too! so i got a burger, and put it on the bbq. 

now, our grill is normally a fiesty motherfucker, causing me to jump back on the best of days, but today would be the day that it finally did its last deed as a fiesty motherfucker. 

when i put the burger on the bbq, flames that would make mt doom look tame, erupted forth, spewing over the succulent meat stuffs i had hoped to consume. just prior to this, i managed to extract two sausages from the fire.

i turned off the gas, we closed the lid. we watched. it burned. it burned and it burned. and then it burned some more, and then flames came a lickin' out from the hood and that's when we called the fire department. 

by time they got here, it was all burnt out, but i can tell you this: as an australian bloke, there is nothing more demasculating than having three other blokes come round to look at the burnt meat on your bbq before checking to see that it won't blow up if you turn it back on again.

    Here is the article: so this fuck up actually happened today for once. a little back story, i'm your typical horny teenage boy, and my parents were gone for the night. throw away because- you'll see.

so, having the house to myself, i get kinda horny being a teenage guy. i decide to fire up omegle, maybe see some boobs, and then go jerk off after the fact. after about an hour or so and seeing a couple pairs of boobs, i get to this on girl. this girl seemed about my age, and she was totally nude, waxing her canoe, or twirlin' her pearl (if ya know what i mean) front of the camera. so obviously insta-boner, and i write hi. i see her feed go black and a few seconds later she reappears totally clothed. i pass it off as that the person who got her to unclog the drain before me had disconnected. she replies "hey" and asks my age and tells me too add her on skype and gives me her username. 

red fucking light. but in my ultimate, horny, hormone driven wisdom, i  make a throwaway skype account, an add that suspicious, gender neutral username. i feel like the biggest idiot typing this out. 

anyways, "she" calls me, i answer, and we get down to business. after a few minutes, i notice that when it says *insert generic name* is typing, and the girl on the screen is busy tapping her tuna. i end the call. i realized that i had been jerking off to some pre recorded video that some old prev had put on the screen. 

three minutes later, this dude messages me and tells me that because i didnt finish on camera, he was going to put my video up somewhere and "make me a fuckin star" and "make my miserable little life a living hell" if i didnt show me finishing. when i confronted him about it being cp, he said i looked over 18 and it wouldnt matter. 

i fucked up really bad this time, and now i dont know what to do wih myself.

    Here is the summary: , i skyped some "girl" i met on omegle, turned out to be fake, and some dude is gonna put that video of me beating my meat up somewhere where i will become a star, all because  didn't finish on camera.

    Here is the article: this one happened a couple hours ago. i changed some titles to protect you from nsfl.

so during the "fattening," i was browsing one of the rant threads that mentioned how it didn't make sense that /r/fatpeoplehate was banned and /r/showswithdogs is not. now before this i had no idea this was a subreddit, or that this was a thing that people even did. so i was torn between whether this was to be taken literally or if this was just another inside joke. one thing was certain though, i can't "not" look.

"old dog learns new trick"

after looking through some comments i realize this is not a joke. (this isn't the actual title but it might as well have been.) i'm that guy that slows down passing car accidents due to my morbid curiosity. now i've seen a lot of shit in my 25 years, but i've never seen a dog show. if it exists  and it is disgusting, you best believe i gotta see it at least once.

so i click the link. baconreader won't load the link so i have to open it in chrome. after about 100 viruses and popups on my phone, i see a play button over a black box. here we go.

click play...nothing.
click again...still nothing.

i click over and over again but nothing happens. chrome says its playing audio but i hear nothing. must be because i have 2 bars and no 4g. 

"fuck t-mobile"

at this point i'm almost at my therapists office for my counseling group. there's a girl there i'm really into, and i spent an hour last night writing her a poem. i arrive, and the factors of the perfect storm come into play.

1. i live in central jersey and its raining.
2. the building broadcasts free wifi.
3. my gmail app has my work email logged in and my chrome has my personal email, which contains the poem i sent to myself as an attachment.

so i forget all about my quest for in lieu of me spending 2 hours crying about my alcoholism and how its my parents fault i drink and shit like that. it's time for the cigarette break and i know this girl is expecting her poem. she tells me she can't wait to hear it. i know that today is the day she falls head over heels for me.

we are outside smoking in the rain, and i tell her i have something for her. she comes up right beside me. she smells amazing and the mutual attraction is almost tangible. i whip out my phone to open up my work of art and proceed to commit one of the worst fuck ups of my life.

apparently once my phone connected to wifi the video loaded, because there wasn't even a bit of lag as she stared in disgust at the hairy horrorshow i was presenting her. the sound worked too. i wish there was some foreplay, but unfortunately it was right out of the gate. it plays for a few seconds before i rush to smash the back button on my phone. does anyone else's phone get unresponsive when its rained on too much? my shitty kyocera does. i couldn't close it. a good 20 seconds of straight up literal doggy style play before i rip the battery out of my phone.

"you're a fucking freak"

she ran back inside. until the end of group everyone was looking at me like they knew i'm the guy that watches my little pony. i texted her something about as long as this post trying to explain myself, but she hasn't texted me back and probably never will. it's a shame because i thought my poem was really well written.

 

edit: to clarify, the subreddit is not called /r/showswithdogs. replace shows with a synonym for gender and rhymes with chex, and there you have it.

    Here is the summary: i chambered a video from /r/showswithdogs and fired at the worst possible time in front of my crush at our therapy group.

    Here is the article: this one happened a couple hours ago. i changed some titles to protect you from nsfl.

so during the "fattening," i was browsing one of the rant threads that mentioned how it didn't make sense that /r/fatpeoplehate was banned and /r/showswithdogs is not. now before this i had no idea this was a subreddit, or that this was a thing that people even did. so i was torn between whether this was to be taken literally or if this was just another inside joke. one thing was certain though, i can't "not" look.

"old dog learns new trick"

after looking through some comments i realize this is not a joke. (this isn't the actual title but it might as well have been.) i'm that guy that slows down passing car accidents due to my morbid curiosity. now i've seen a lot of shit in my 25 years, but i've never seen a dog show. if it exists  and it is disgusting, you best believe i gotta see it at least once.

so i click the link. baconreader won't load the link so i have to open it in chrome. after about 100 viruses and popups on my phone, i see a play button over a black box. here we go.

click play...nothing.
click again...still nothing.

i click over and over again but nothing happens. chrome says its playing audio but i hear nothing. must be because i have 2 bars and no 4g. 

"fuck t-mobile"

at this point i'm almost at my therapists office for my counseling group. there's a girl there i'm really into, and i spent an hour last night writing her a poem. i arrive, and the factors of the perfect storm come into play.

1. i live in central jersey and its raining.
2. the building broadcasts free wifi.
3. my gmail app has my work email logged in and my chrome has my personal email, which contains the poem i sent to myself as an attachment.

so i forget all about my quest for in lieu of me spending 2 hours crying about my alcoholism and how its my parents fault i drink and shit like that. it's time for the cigarette break and i know this girl is expecting her poem. she tells me she can't wait to hear it. i know that today is the day she falls head over heels for me.

we are outside smoking in the rain, and i tell her i have something for her. she comes up right beside me. she smells amazing and the mutual attraction is almost tangible. i whip out my phone to open up my work of art and proceed to commit one of the worst fuck ups of my life.

apparently once my phone connected to wifi the video loaded, because there wasn't even a bit of lag as she stared in disgust at the hairy horrorshow i was presenting her. the sound worked too. i wish there was some foreplay, but unfortunately it was right out of the gate. it plays for a few seconds before i rush to smash the back button on my phone. does anyone else's phone get unresponsive when its rained on too much? my shitty kyocera does. i couldn't close it. a good 20 seconds of straight up literal doggy style play before i rip the battery out of my phone.

"you're a fucking freak"

she ran back inside. until the end of group everyone was looking at me like they knew i'm the guy that watches my little pony. i texted her something about as long as this post trying to explain myself, but she hasn't texted me back and probably never will. it's a shame because i thought my poem was really well written.

 

edit: to clarify, the subreddit is not called /r/showswithdogs. replace shows with a synonym for gender and rhymes with chex, and there you have it.

    Here is the article: this happened about a year ago, of course. tifu apparently never happens on the day of the event.

so i rented inception to watch with my family. we all sat down, having heard about a weird but cool movie.

the film started, and a female voice began to narrate. "oh, ok. opening narration," we all thought. "no problem." but it didn't go away. scene after scene played, with the woman narrating the entire time.

by this point everyone's getting annoyed. none of us had heard about the constant narration, and we were all sick of it. we couldn't stand it. in fact, as the credits started to roll, dad loudly proclaimed he never wanted to see the movie again. then the woman said five words.

"narration for visually impaired by..."

i moved my fat arse slightly to discover that at the start of the film, i'd sat on the remote and turned on the audio channel.

    Here is the summary: sat on a remote and ruined the movie inception for my entire family.

    Here is the article: it's not a busy day, not much to do, so i decide to take a 30 min relax moment at the toilet.

i plug in my headphones for some music, texting some friends while taking a dump.

the music was good, reaaal good, i was bouncing around a bit until the toilet seat slipped off and basically flipped-launched me 90 degrees at the wall onto the ground. 

i lay on the ground, pants on my knees, trying to figure out what the fuck did just happen.

could've been worse if i had one hanging out...

    Here is the article: this happened around several months ago, not today (sorry :p).

being 16, you don't have the money to get most of the things you want. you also don't know much about your bank account if your parents didn't teach you about it.

i had a bunch of money saved up on my checking account from working in my dad's restaurant. however, since i didn't have any method to withdraw it (i didn't have a debit card yet), i couldn't use the money to buy things that i wanted. i could ask my dad, but he would probably say no.

then i started working. i received several paychecks and life went normal, until the charger for my macbook broke. i seriously needed one, and i found a payment method on amazon, which was to add your bank account. i thought:

"well gosh darn, the numbers on my paycheck look the same as the 'bank routing number' and 'checking account number', i guess i can get my money out of my account this way!"

i didn't know the numbers were actually the numbers used for my boss's bank account. i thought those numbers linked to my own bank account. fuck.

the very next day, my boss contacted me saying that $1.68 was extracted from her bank account from amazon, which then linked the purchase to me. i told him what happened, and he was cool about it. he thought that telling the truth was better than lying since this was a serious fraud case. i honestly didn't know how amazon can use your check numbers to link your bank account, and i still don't know.

fortunately, i had a gift card balance that killed the price on the charger to $1.68 from $17.37, which my boss was okay that i didn't have to pay him $1.68 (he had a paper that showed him the withdrawal from his account which only said the $1.68).

[**here's proof that i bought the charger.**](http://imgur.com/snaldhd)

    Here is the summary: i used the numbers on my paycheck to access my boss's bank account to pay for a macbook charger, although i thought it linked to my bank account (i was 16, i didn't know jack shit about that).**

    Here is the article: so our house is across the green way from the neighborhood pool, i can stand on my porch and see the parking lot and pool. this afternoon we see a couple people parked at the very back of the the otherwise empty pool and parking lot drinking out of red solo cups and smoking at their car, we can't see anyone at the pool itself.

we watch them for about 10 minutes and decide to call the local pd dispatch and ask them to stop by to make sure the people are residents of the neighborhood, aren't doing illegal shit, etc. 

after i get off the phone i see a couple kids splashing in the pool, now i figure it's probably these people's kids. we watch the cops show up, they talk for maybe a few seconds and the lady points back in to the neighborhood. they and the cops talk and laugh for a few more seconds and the cops leave. the lady then looks back at our row of houses and starts wagging her finger and then waving.

apparently these people live in my neighborhood and i called the cops on them for being at the pool they pay hoa dues for, so now i feel like a dick. part of me wants to find them and try to apologize, the rest of me realizes that would do nothing to help and i need to just learn something from this and move on.

apparently these people live in my neighborhood and i called the cops on them for being at the pool they pay hoa dues for, so now i feel like a dick. part of me wants to find them and try to apologize, the rest of me realizes that would do nothing to help and i need to just learn something from this and move on.

    Here is the summary: I called the local pd dispatch and asked them to stop by to make sure the people were residents of the neighborhood, weren't doing illegal shit, etc.

    You will be given one summary written for a news article. Your task is to rate the summary based on the following criteria:
    Output format: PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE

    Evaluation Criteria:
    1. Read the news article carefully and identify the main topic and key points.
    2. Read the summary and compare it to the news article. Check if the summary covers the main topic and key points of the news article, and if it resents them in a clear and logical order.
    3. Rate the summary with 5 percentages, where each one represents how likely the summary is going to get a score from 1 to 5. For example, if you think the summary is 80% likely to get a score of 5, 10% likely to get a score of 4, 5% likely to get a score of 3, 3% likely to get a score of 2, and 1% likely to get a score of 1, you should rate the summary as 80, 10, 5, 3, 2.

    Here is the article: ***(apologies in advance for spelling and grammar bc iphone)***

so, this happened a year ago. too lazy to make a new account. 

my sister and i are in highschool, so everyone in my family knows that as a teenage male, i gotta jerk it every now and then. 

my sister and i stay up late while our parents are asleep so this is usually a good time for us to do whatever.

i feel the urge coming and i decide to fap off with the door open bc i didn't think my sister would come out.  little did i know, with my door open my sister has a full on view of me from her room if she stands at her door.

i catch her walking by as i hear someone  and try to play it off as if i was scratching myself. she asks: "what are you doing?..." since it was very dark in my room at night.

i don't answer and she then proceeds to go back into her room. now, my heart was racing at this point and i decided to try to patch/clear things up.

i go into her room and ask if she had any lotion for my 'itchy-ness.'

lol.

    Here is the summary: wacked it and tried to play it off cool

    Here is the article: ok so this didn't happen today (maybe a year ago) but now that i come back to think about it, it was pretty funny.

so one day i get home from school real bored, so i decided to go on my computer and code something. i had a great idea that i could write a program that talks to my friends on facebook. so it would be as if they were talking to me, but they're actually talking to a computer program!

so i made it in java, took a few hours to figure out how to connect my facebook and i used some random aiml thing i found online to generate replies and such.

now i was extremely exited to get this up and running, so i didn't really debug, all i knew was that it could reply to friends that messaged me (good enough), so i turned it on and wait and i returned later.

this is when it gets awkward. turns out there was a some sort of bug in my code. for some reason all the replies started going from the person that messaged me to random people on my friends list. (i believe the bug had something to do with indexing friends and my program not updating the index properly). 

i can say that i don't personally know ~70% of the people on my facebook friends list, most of them are just mutual friends. 

so, to those random people that my program sent messages to, it seemed as if i was some weird kid trying to talk to them. there were quite a few messages that my program sent and it usually involved small talk like "how is the weather?" or "what is your favourite colour?".

i felt super awkward when i had to explain that it wasn't really me that was messaging them but instead my program. some people just thought i was really weird or something like that.

anyways, it ended fairly well, i did troll my friends, so good enough.

    Here is the summary: : wrote crappy program with bugs that talked to random people on my fb friends list.

    Here is the article: so i'm an beginner programmer and i have a tendency to build dumb things. little games where you can't win or just dumb things in general. but the latest project i had been working on was, what i like to call a file pumper. the objective of this project was to see how easy it was to just create data. and as it turns out it is very easy.

so i use java mainly because it is the first (and as of right now only) programming language i am efficient in. (i am working on learning c++ right now). but i created a program with 3 features. a .txt file creator, a infinite file creator, and filling a .txt file with random numbers infinitely. as you can probably figure out i expected no good to come out of this. 

but i had finally worked out all of the kinks in the program and i go to test each feature. i get to the infinite file creator and i check the folder that all the .txt files were supposed to go to and... they were't there. a quick search later for just general .txt files on my system tell me that there are 117,848 files from the program i had created sitting in my eclipse project workspace. 

the program had run for barely thirty seconds. thats ~3928 files created every second. (my computer is a mac so i was both surprised that my mac was able to make that many files a second. but hey they were all blank). so i figure hey this is fine, i'll just delete the folder.

i go to do that and lo and behold 15 minutes later the folder is still trying to be deleted.

 


edit: because people were asking here is a link to the [github](https://github.com/matthewbotchek/filepumper ) page that contains my program

i woke up around 2am needing to use the toilet. i took a piss and figured i'd flush it in the morning. as i was heading back to bed i remembered i hadn't brushed my teeth so i walked back and started brushing. i must add it was pretty dark as i hadn't turned the strip lighting on. i get to the point i need to spit and rinse the brush midway through and with a spark of inspiration remember i have bottles of water lying around the place. i grab the nearest one and pour roughly where the brush is...you know, in relation to my hands. had i been more awake i may have noticed the eerily quiet flow of the 'water' but it was only after sticking the brush back in my mouth and starting back brushing the the taste hit my tongue.
i'm backpacking and so as to save space i poured what was left of my liquid detergent into an old water bottle.
the more i rinsed the worse it got (obviously), i grabbed my flannel and did some mouth scraping ...which worked ok actually. i had mouthwash but due to its bacteria killing properties i was forbidden from using it as it would kill the bacteria in the waste treatment underground container thingy. mouthwashed into a cup, cleaned off my toothbrush with a lot of hot water (at this point my considerations had gone out the window) and re brushed. took me a good 30-40 minutes to get  back to sleep after that.

the more i rinsed the worse it got (obviously), i grabbed my flannel and did some mouth scraping ...which worked ok actually. i had mouthwash but due to its bacteria killing properties i was forbidden from using it as it would kill the bacteria in the waste treatment underground container thingy. mouthwashed into a cup, cleaned off my toothbrush with a lot of hot water (at this point my considerations had gone out the window) and re brushed. took me a good 30-40 minutes to get  back to sleep after that.

    Here is the summary: I woke up around 2am needing to use the toilet.

    You will be given one summary written for a news article. Your task is to rate the summary based on the following criteria:
    Output format: PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE

    Evaluation Criteria:
    1. Read the news article carefully and identify the main topic and key points.
    2. Read the summary and compare it to the news article. Check if the summary covers the main topic and key points of the news article, and if it resents them in a clear and logical order.
    3. Rate the summary with 5 percentages, where each one represents how likely the summary is going to get a score from 1 to 5. For example, if you think the summary is 80% likely to get a score of 5, 10% likely to get a score of 4, 5% likely to get a score of 3, 3% likely to get a score of 2, and 1% likely to get a score of 1, you should rate the summary as 80, 10, 5, 3, 2.

    Here is the article: okay, bit of a highly technical/computer fu, and also the actual thing i did wrong happened about 10 months ago.  however, i didn't notice (and fix) it until this morning.  read on.

when i built my current computer i kind of went crazy with ram.  it was cheap at the time, like super cheap, so i got 32gb of mid-high-end ram, figuring eventually it'd get put to use.  it soon became clear that wasn't going to happen: running high end games or video rendering (sometimes at the same time) i could barely hit 16gb usage.

that in mind, i decided to do something useful with the excess ram and turn it into a virtual hard drive to use for my temp files/folders.  this had a few advantages, mainly that it would be lightning fast and also would automatically clear out on power down, two things which are ideal for temp files.  i found a nice piece of software, allocated 8 gigs of my ram to it, set up the new folder paths in windows, and went on my way.

things went smoothly after that, mostly.  i say mostly because a few months later i started noticing weird issues with steam and some other programs, where they wouldn't work properly until my computer had been up and running for about 10 minutes.  at one point i had to literally re-install steam to get it to work every time i booted my computer, but then the issue went away.  i figured it was some oddly specific steam bug they fixed and moved on.

flash forward to yesterday.  i go to load up a game and the launcher crashes, and keeps crashing, over and over and over.  this happened a few times in the past, but now it was refusing to clear up, and i didn't feel like re-downloading 25 gigs of game just to re-install.  i decided to load up process explorer to see if i could figure out what was going on, and that won't load either.  eventually i track down that error as a temporary folder issue, so i go and check on the ram drive.  nothing's wrong, everything seems fine.  in fact the drive is empty, completely... which is when it hits me.

my ram drive: z:

my temp folder path: z:\temp

thinking "no, that couldn't be it," i make a folder called "temp" in the ram drive, then try to fire up my game and process explorer.  both work immediately.  i facepalm.

turns out, most programs just assume your temp folder, whatever it is, is going to be there.  if it's not they don't bother trying to recreate it, they just fail.

anyway, i modified my ram disk program to automatically create a temp folder and suddenly my problems went away.  my computer is running better than ever.  i really don't feel smart for someone who used to make money as a network admin.

    Here is the summary: i made a ram drive from my excess ram, pointed all my windows temp folders to a folder in the ram drive that wasn't automatically created, and most windows programs aren't smart enough to make a new temp folder if one doesn't exist.  computer runs crappily on startup for 10 months until i notice.**

    Here is the article: this fu happened the other day as my so and i were walking back from the store. he's been having a rough few weeks and as we were talking he said something along the lines of "when the world randomly lashes out, i want to randomly lash out against the world." this vaguely reminded me of a quote from stalin when his wife died, "this creature softened my heart of stone. she died and with her died my last warm feelings for humanity." 

so this is pretty much how it went down: 

(above quote) 

"huh, what you said kinda reminds me of what stalin said about losing feelings for the world"

"so you're saying i'm like stalin?"

"no! no, you, my dear, are a kindred spirit"

this is my fuck up. i thought "kindred" meant "cultivated" or something and that a "kindred spirit" was someone who had a good soul or some shit. well, my so being better at vocab took it not as i intended.

"you just said i am exactly like stalin!"

"wait, what? oh shit! what does kindred mean?"

"it means alike! ya dingus"

    Here is the article: okay this fuck up happened yesterday (yifu?) but i was still in shock so was unable to think properly.

now i am a university student and currently live in japan with my girlfriend in a prefecture called akita. for those of you who don't know, akita rains so much its almost wetter than an taking an underwater shower so when the sun comes out you try your best to take advantage of it.

this past week has had just as many good days as bad days though and i started to ride my rusty old bike to the local mariner. this mariner is beautiful and there is a view of the local mountain, eagles, a family of cats, wind farms and a nice break wall you can climb and walk around.

anyway, yesterday at around 4:30pm the sun decides to show its face so i convince my girlfriend to come to the mariner with me to watch the sunset thinking myself to be another casanova.

now i mentioned there is a breakwall you can climb but my girlfriend was too scared to get up the wall. on one side of the wall, next to the ocean, it is shorter and easier to get up and eventually i convince her to let me push her foot up and... queue fuck up.

she was wearing a cardigan with very big open pockets, bigger than most quality manufacturer standards. as i begin pushing her, i see something terrible out the corner of my eye, something all all too iphone 6s shaped moving with all the speed of a brick towards the ground. even worse it is falling sea side and bounces off the breakwall into fish city. i never saw such a broken hearted face from her before untill that moment. 

so now i'm trying to find a way to afford a new phone so if anyone knows an iphone dealer that will accept a kidney as payment, let me know.

    Here is the article: so this fu is spread over most of this year. i had this girl in quite a few of my classes sophomore year of high school (i am a junior now) and had developed quite the crush on her. me, being the little shy kid with bad hair, would not ask her out because i figured i would get rejected and it would be award around her for the rest of the year. so the year wraps up and i hate myself for not asking her out, but the show must go on so i distract myself from my thoughts of her however i can. come july i still can't get her out of my head, the world cup (was with netherlands) was a pleasant distraction but overall i was still pretty sad. finally, around halfway through the month, i work up the nerve to try to strike up a conversation on whatsapp. we had been maintaining sporadic contact throughout the summer so it wasn't totally out of the blue. lo and behold, we end up talking 6 hours through the night! we keep up talking for hours daily for two weeks, and even managed to get together one time with a few other people, but with other people so it wasn't a date. after two weeks she travels, and every time i try to talk to her i get one word responses. i figure it was just that she was traveling sand didn't have time but even after she came back she wouldn't talk to me. the new school year starts and we don't have any classes together :( so i cant really talk to her much in person, and sometimes she would avoid any room i was in, poking her head in then leaving. now i was very confused. so i keep up talking to her hoping she would eventually warm up to me again, and eventually she sends me a message saying why she was ignoring me and that she felt immature. what's funny is that as i replied to that message, she was online, but never sent anything else. i tell myself everything will be ok, but yesterday my friend saw her flirting with this guy that has seemed to have been getting close to her, so i'm not so sure. 

 

sorry if this was poorly written, english is not my first language :)

    Here is the summary: crush on girl, didn't ask her out. got close to her in the summer, but then was ignored by her, now she is flirting with someone else

For example, if you think the summary is 80% likely to get a score of 5, 10% likely to get a score of 4, 5% likely to get a score of 3, 3% likely to get a score of 2, and 1% likely to get a score of 1, you should rate the summary as 80, 10, 5, 3, 2.

    Here is the article: so this fu is spread over most of this year. i had this girl in quite a few of my classes sophomore year of high school (i am a junior now) and had developed quite the crush on her. me, being the little shy kid with bad hair, would not ask her out because i figured i would get rejected and it would be award around her for the rest of the year. so the year wraps up and i hate myself for not asking her out, but the show must go on so i distract myself from my thoughts of her however i can. come july i still can't get her out of my head, the world cup (was with netherlands) was a pleasant distraction but overall i was still pretty sad. finally, around halfway through the month, i work up the nerve to try to strike up a conversation on whatsapp. we had been maintaining sporadic contact throughout the summer so it wasn't totally out of the blue. lo and behold, we end up talking 6 hours through the night! we keep up talking for hours daily for two weeks, and even managed to get together one time with a few other people, but with other people so it wasn't a date. after two weeks she travels, and every time i try to talk to her i get one word responses. i figure it was just that she was traveling sand didn't have time but even after she came back she wouldn't talk to me. the new school year starts and we don't have any classes together :( so i cant really talk to her much in person, and sometimes she would avoid any room i was in, poking her head in then leaving. now i was very confused. so i keep up talking to her hoping she would eventually warm up to me again, and eventually she sends me a message saying why she was ignoring me and that she felt immature. what's funny is that as i replied to that message, she was online, but never sent anything else. i tell myself everything will be ok, but yesterday my friend saw her flirting with this guy that has seemed to have been getting close to her, so i'm not so sure. 

 

sorry if this was poorly written, english is not my first language :)

    Here is the summary: I had a crush on a girl in high school but didn't ask her out because I was afraid of rejection.

    Here is the article: okay, so, i went to grab a quick shower before bed and decided to trim up the shaggy bits of my beard before hopping into the shower. apparently my trimmer had been reset from the usual setting i use (and always keep it on), to the shortest setting. a fact i did not realize until i had already made a big swipe across the length of my face in such a way that i had to shave everything else down. it's now down to barely 5 o'clock shadow. this is the shortest my beard has been in like 3.5 years. fml.

i'm the only person who uses this trimmer. i never change it from that setting. i probably should have checked before applying it to my face. but i mean, there's literally no reason that it would be set to anything other than my preferred length. either i'm an idiot and spun it around, or someone else in the house changed it on me.

let's be honest though, it's probably me that farted around with it one day and didn't remember. now i guess i'm regrowing my beard for the next few weeks. ...my face feels naked.

    Here is the summary: didn't check beard trimmer before applying to face. shaved a big chunk all the way down to stubble and had to shave rest of face to match.

    Here is the article: the title is actually misleading. i’m the officer, and i was pranking a caseworker. where i work, officers are responsible for running the control centers, providing backup in case of emergency, and escorting/supervising inmates throughout the facility. caseworkers do all the work in a housing unit, like conducting searches, counts, monitoring/correcting inmate behavior, trying to convince them to do programming so they might be a better person when they get out, etc. 

well i just happened to get scheduled to work the control center in the most dangerous housing unit tonight. i am safe; i have an escape hatch and reinforced windows. the caseworker, however, has to walk onto the gallery to do his job. just to point out, 90% of inmates are chill, keep to themselves, and are even very respectful to staff. sure it’s dangerous, but not as bad as the media makes it seem. the one’s the cause issues are a minority, and this minority are usually sent to seg (basically a private cell with private programming because solitary proved to make people worse) after they do something, and if they behave in seg they get sent to this “test” gallery i’m watching, where if they behave themselves they are rewarded with access to general population (the rest of the inmates).

well, to make matters worse, we’re currently on extended lockdown because of a riot that happened, and this gallery has gotten the short stick because the guys who started it all came from here. even though the rest of them weren’t (directly) involved, they all have to remain on 23.5 hour lockdown, which sucks. so what happens when you get half a gallery (because the other half of the rooms are empty from all the rioters being sent to seg) full of pissed off, repressed inmates? you get a staff that accidently pops open all the doors. don’t worry, that isn’t my fuckup, but that happened and they almost started another riot.

so as i’m sitting making fun of that specific event, watching the caseworker do his count, i think it’ll be funny as hell to pop open all the empty cells. scared the shit out of him, i was laughing my ass off. i’ve never seen a large guy move that fast! not too long after, i get relieved and sent to the admin’s officer, where i was handed a statement of charges ( super write up). i should have known better than to pull a prank like that in a fucking prison, but hey, i’m human and want to scapegoat sleep deprivation on this one.

    Here is the summary: i popped empty cells to make a caseworker fear for his life.

    Here is the article: this fuck up happened about three hours ago.

sorry if i make a lot of grammatical mistakes, i am not a native english speaker.

so i ordered the national geographic documentary "our blue planet" + 2 other nature series on blue ray about 2 days ago and because i wanted to make the viewing experience perfect, i went ahead to dial up my local dealer and get some weed.

i received the box set in the mail today and couldn't contain my excitement of watching it, so i immediately rolled up about 3 spliffs to get the session going.

the first 2 spliffs burnt up pretty quickly and although i was already pretty high, i thought i might aswell just shoot myself up into outer space before starting to watch the series.

so i am standing at my window smoking and after taking a few hits, i notice that there is a lot of excess smoke coming from the lit end of the spliff.

being in my mindset i was in i figured it would be an amazing idea to suck in the smoke coming from that end while in between hits, to preserve some weed and get even higher.

i put the lit end into my mouth almost head shot style, pulled in the smoke, swallowing the red ember ash, proceeding to cough the life out of my body and begin to spray puke while continuing to cough everywhere until i eventually black out due to lack of oxygen.

after what must have been about 5 to 10 seconds of unconciousness i wake up on my floor with puke all over me and everywhere else in my room and an extremely harsh burning sensation in my throat. 

i stand up very slowly to not black out again and possible cave my face in on my radiator, walk up to my window to see if anyone noticed what the hell just went down to see my horrified looking  neighbour at her window, shouting over to ask if im fine.

i respond: "yeahs all good" in a very dazed manner, she nods and walks away from her window.

    Here is the summary: : wanted to watch a nature documentary, almost coughed myself into the hospital.

For example, if you think the summary is 80% likely to get a score of 5, 10% likely to get a score of 4, 5% likely to get a score of 3, 3% likely to get a score of 2, and 1% likely to get a score of 1, you should rate the summary as 80, 10, 5, 3, 2.

    Here is the article: so this isn't necessarily *today* but about 4 months ago. i was sitting down to eat lunch at school with my friend and a girl that i like. that day we had turkey and gravy over mashed potatoes for lunch. i fucking love turkey-gravy day so i was eating quickly as i usually do. although this day was different: i hadn't had breakfast that morning so i was extra hungry. 

i kicked it into hoover vacuum mode and ate so quickly that the food could not get down my throat quick enough. i then coughed up a whole bunch of turkey and somehow it got lodged in my nose. then i go into a panic because i am unsure of what the hell is happening. before i can even run to the restroom or even pick up a napkin, the pepper that was on the turkey makes me sneeze a snot/turkey/mashed potato concoction all over the table, my friend, his food, and of course the girl that i really like.

    Here is the summary: was eating my lunch too fast, and sneezed it all over a girl i like.

    Here is the article: i'll be honest i'm a very oblivious person but today i managed to break a record. back in september i bought tickets to go see aurora aksnes at webster hall on november 3rd. i bought the tickets on her website where the dates are written european style 3/11/16. obviously when i bought these it was way after march so i think to myself "oh backwards date thing. this concert is on the 3rd of november." as weeks pass i forget the date of the concert and check back periodically to make i got the date correct. i instinctively look at the number 11. the real problem here is that i see the number 3 but because i already know the concert is in november i start subconsciously associating the number 3 with november. 

fast forward to election day and i feel horrible. i haven't been getting a lot sleep, my big sister is crying, my jamaican parents are livid, i start worrying for my friends and the future and i just want to run away from it all. i plan a trip to strawberry fields on the 11th in central park because i need a place like strawberry fields to get away from this week. so i packed my all my art shit and go. i'm drawing for about two hours until a man in a red hat with a hammer and sickle on it walks in strawberry fields and pulls out a stick of chalk. he starts writing "make america great again" right above the imagine mosaic. the man playing beatles songs on his guitar is pissed. some other guy is pissed because he has to clean it up. everyone that looks like they're not pissed are taking pictures so they can be pissed about it later. im pissed because trump shit followed me to a place i did not expect. trump dude starts bad-mouthing new yorkers and leaves. the guy that had to clean it up pours water on the chalk and im on the ground stunned. i stared angrily as a stream of water with swirling leaf bits slowly inch towards my clipboard zig zagging the concrete crevices. i start thinking this is a good time to leave... i check all my stuff and realized i left the art i made for the concert at home. i start feeling stupid because i live an hour away but i say its fine because i had a meeting over skype in 2 hours anyway. i was going to do it on my phone but i guess ill do it at home and leave.

i go home and start watching some videos to pass the time when the video i was watching says "today is 11/11" my brain freezes because those numbers don't sound right. i look at my ticket and yeah... missed the concert by over a week. oh boy i feel dumb. now thinking about it i'm so good at not paying attention. i once managed to ignore an earthquake back in 2011. i once was playing catch with my cousin and my hand starts bleeding profusely and i didn't realize until i actively looked at it....i'm going back to bed.

    Here is the article: throwaway because my girlfriend knows this is probably going up here.  this happened an hour or two ago...

so instead of going out shopping like a lot of people on black friday, my girlfriend and i decided to go on a hike.  we hike up a mountain near her town, and everything was good: the weather, view at the top, etc.  after spending some time enjoying the view at the top of the mountain, i suggest to her that we take the road back down as it was getting dark.  she agrees, and we set out to go back down the mountain.  we walked for an hour and at this point it was really dark out. that's when i realized, i made an oopsie. i take out my phone and open up maps....we were going down the mountain on the complete opposite side of where my car was parked.  at that point we were about 4 miles away from the car.  i look at my girlfriend and she say"wenthikingtoday, you are a fool!"  so we continue walking and finally park police happened to drive up the other way.  the officer stops and the first thing out of my mouth was "officer i've made a huge mistake"  i go on to explain the situation, and he agrees to give us a ride back to my car after he clears out the remaining cars from up the road.  we wait 20 minutes and he finally returns. we hop in and on the ride back, my girlfriend makes me admit in front of the nice police officer that i a male human being, was wrong.  she should've just told me it would've been quicker to go back down the trail...

    Here is the summary: went hiking with the girlfriend, decided to take an alternate way back to the car, alternate route takes us miles away from where we need to be, police gives us ride, i admit defeat.

    Here is the article: i tried to post this on the day it happened (thanksgiving) but couldn't because of the new rules.

anyway, throw away because obviously.

it's been a long thanksgiving. i started off by working the morning shift at my place of employment, driving about 3 hours in the wind and snow to my family's place, awkwardly enjoying food, and then a 3 hour drive back so that i could get to work at midnight.

i always get a 24 oz coffee from the same chain gas station so that i can get all of the points. i get home, set my coffee on my coffee table (because that's where coffee goes), and chill with my cat for a minute. then i start getting ready for work and realize i've forgotten to take my glucosamine pills for my bad knees.

i grab the pills and head over to the coffee table to swig down my pills with my delicious coffee. this is where i fuck up. i take a swig and wonder, "why is my coffee so cold and taste so horrible?" i realize i have not grabbed my coffee but rather the cup i took a swig from was full of my old, smelly cum.

i spit it all out (i know, i'm a quitter. deal with it). gagging commences. i go in my bathroom and just run water through my mouth. go to use mouth wash but realize i'm gagging too much to do so. eventually compose myself enough to use the mouthwash and go to work.

i spit it all out (i know, i'm a quitter. deal with it). gagging commences. i go in my bathroom and just run water through my mouth. go to use mouth wash but realize i'm gagging too much to do so. eventually compose myself enough to use the mouthwash and go to work.

    Here is the summary: i started off by working the morning shift at my place of employment, driving about 3 hours in the wind and snow to my family's place, awkwardly enjoying food, and then a 3 hour drive back so that i could get to work at midnight.

    Here is the article: this happened back in high school, but i still fucked up.

we took a field trip to some play. got to the theater, i sit with this girl i've been talking to for a while. i'm cracking jokes, shits going great. she decides to say something funny. it probably wasn't really that funny but i was in love so i busted out laughing. 

the thing was, i had a cold that day and i had been keeping a giant fucking lugie in my mouth because i had nowhere to get rid of it. it was too warm and gross to swallow and i couldn't just spit it on the floor. 

so anyway, she makes me laugh and this wad of my spit and mucous comes flying out of my mouth at mach 10 and lands on her shoulder. 

i'm all o_o

she's fucking repulsed. "ewwww why did you do that?!"

i needed to fix the situation fast because she was making a scene. quickly, without thinking, i frantically grabbed for my nasal mouth juice. i'm grabbing and snatching, trying to get it off this girl's shirt. 

*rrrrriiiipppp*

her fucking shirt ripped right off. i don't really know how. it was this silky kind of shirt that was all artsy and shit and it just came right off. we were both speechless now but she gave me this look... i'll never forget that look. she broke up with me with that look. 

she took her shirt back and ran to the bathroom and i just sat there with my spit still in my hand.

    Here is the summary: - i spit mucous on a girl and then ripped her shirt off on a field trip.

    Here is the article: this happened just thirty minutes ago. i'm in my morning clinic at my surgery seeing patients (i'm a general practioner in the uk), and this lady comes in with hand numbness and after checking her hand out i conclude it's carpal tunnel syndrome.

so to better explain the anatomy and how to manage it i google image 'carpal tunnel' and click on an image, turn the monitor around for her to see and because the image is a bit too small i click on it again and go to the website...

this my friends is where i made the mistake as this is the first thing she saw as i scrolled down to the image.(nsfw most likely....certainly not mine)

http://www.carpaltunnelgadgets.com/blog-page/

we looked at each other and i figured the best course of action was to hit the back button and keep talking like it never ever happened.

    Here is the summary: tried to show my patient what the carpal tunnel is, instead showed her hentai.

    Here is the article: so, i have been dating this girl for roughly 9 months and today, she told me that she was going to see her mom for money... i was already a bit skeptical knowing that one, her mom is flat broke and doesn't have a job... so naturally, me not thinking straight, decided to follow her. (i know, it sounds creepy, but wouldn't you want to know the truth with that shady of a story??) so anyways, i followed her at a decent pace and as far as i know, she didn't suspect a thing. but then, things got much, much worse. i got to about 20 minutes of driving and all of the sudden, she stopped at a hotel, i was on the tips of my toes with fright. i was thinking to myself, "what the hell will i do if i see this guy!? should i confront them? do i just let them go and wait until i get home to confront her??" none of these happened, however. i pulled into the lot next to the motel and waited, 11 minutes passed (guessing) and then the other car pulled up. i was ready to die right then and there, but then the worst thing happens: a woman steps out with a man and they begin to talk. i couldn't hear anything, as the dumb spy in me said not to even try it. they turn around after a bit and walk. directly towards where i am at! oh shit. i'm caught. she stops by my car and me being already red faced, turn to her and act surprised. she doesn't buy it... so here i am, red still, in that said parking lot, discussing what precisely i was doing here. i'm writing this in hopes that everything will turn out okay... but the future looks a bit bleak at this point.

    Here is the article: i got sick of sinusitis yesterday and when i went to the doctor, she told me i should be treated with a cannula, so they won't have to puncture my skin each team. the nurse responsible to apply the cannula, didn't get it right the first. the second time, though, she started wiggling it back and forth to see if she managed to puncture the vein. in that moment i felt like the world started to spin around, fainted and collapsed to the ground. i woke up soon after with my pants warm and wet and with 4 nurses trying to wake me up.

    Here is the summary: I got sick of sinusitis yesterday and went to the doctor.

    Here is the article: this one literally makes me cringe to write down, more on that in a bit, but i hope that this story ends up saving someone else's skin in the future. 

so, my fuck up comes from a perfectly enjoyable weekend. i was invited out to a local camping and festival site with my best friend to help out a friend of hers clear woods for camping later this spring. it's an opportunity to get out in the beautiful weather, be around fun, nature-loving people and to clean up the planet a little bit. so far, so good. 

we set to work; dragging brush, raking back dead grass and vines, digging out old stumps, and sorting through hippy artifacts of festivals past. my friend's friend offered gloves for us, but since i preferred to feel the mattock handle in my bare hands, i declined.

this is fuck up number one.  

i did everything without wearing gloves, which means, that whenever i unwittingly touched a little hairy old vine that happened to be poison mother fucking ivy, i didn't notice it. 

the rest of the day plays out fine. we make great progress for the day, have a good lunch, even get to play fight a little bit with play swords and bow-and-arrows. 

i get back to the house that i'm sitting and, being the seasoned forest dweller i am, decide the best thing to do is get a shower. i washed with the best soap i had (in retrospect i've been picturing the glorious bottle of tecnu i have at home) and call it a night, thinking that whatever i may have been exposed to--chiggers, ticks, poison ivy---would all have been washed off and down the drain.

ha.ha ha. hnnnng. 

a couple hours since my shower have passed and i've gotten ready for bed. i've got no itchiness on my skin anywhere at this point. i have somehow convinced myself to believe that since i don't feel itchy anywhere now, that means i didn't get any poison ivy on myself at all. i put down my book and turn off the light. that's when i did get a certain itch that can only be scratched one way, that i imagine many other single men and women have gotten, and knew what to do to..ah..scratch my particular itch. i went through with my deed and slept like a rock. 

wake up the next morning already feeling the woeful tightness and itch on my right hand. i'm lying in bed still when i am thinking of this itch, and feel the slightest tickle on my face. 

shit. 

get up and go to the bathroom mirror, and sure as shit, see a small patch of the devils goddamn gonorrhea on my cheekbone. i look at my right hand, and see the all too-familiar blisters between my index, middle and ring fingers. and on my left hand. and on my right forearm. 

shit. 

find some calamine lotion and take stock of all the spots i find, and treat them accordingly, use my best jedi mind tricks to keep from scratching and hope for the best. 

get back to the house yesterday afternoon and do my best again to not scratch anything. the poison spread a little bit, but not too badly. 

i wake up this morning, and lo and behold, the spot on my cheekbone has spread to the greater part of my cheek and is flirting with the corner of my eye. and, i've got an itch. this time it's not that kind that one should scratch at all. 

a further visual inspection confirms that i've got poison ivy on worst fucking place i've ever gotten it. right on the outer lips of my vagina. and i'm afraid not even a yoda-level midichlorian count in my bloodstream would help me distract myself from the most irritating, cringe-inducing, and utterly unscratchable itch that i've now got to ignore and treat for probably 2 weeks. even typing at the computer makes me cringe because of how i have to spread my fingers and hold my right arm off the table and computer because of where the rash is on my forearm. fuck.

wear your gloves, kiddos. or at the very least, wash like you're about to scrub into brain surgery, because this is going to be a long exercise in mindfulness and discipline.

in retrospect, i feel like it takes a solid exposure like this every few years to remind myself that yes i should wear gloves and yes i should carry the right soap in my vehicle with me at all fucking times.

    Here is the summary: got into poison ivy. flicked my bean. rip vagina.

    Here is the summary: I was at my grandma's house and decided to masturbate.

    Here is the article: so, as happens, this was about two weeks ago.
it was a tuesday at 1 am. my friends are interrogating me about my love life and me being the emotionally detached person i am, i didn't want to talk about it. some background, i had been talking to one girl (two dates, 70 day snap streak as best friends), for a while and once we got to school she just kinda stopped talking. so i tell my friends and they push me to actually confront her, which i don't want to do, and i try twice to get up and leave the room but both times one of them blocks the door and it's late and i'm non confrontational anyway so i stay. they turn off the lights. i jump up to run and immediately trip and fall really, really hard. my knee was scraped and my right foot didn't feel great either. so my roommate, hearing my impact with the floor, comes running and helps me hobble to my bed and i go to sleep. i wake up the next morning and my foot is purple-black with bruises on top. thinking i can get by, i wear a shoe on one foot and a slipper on the bruised one. i ended up going to the er the next day and they did x-rays. no breaks, except in my pride as i hobbled around campus for a while. two weeks later and my foot still hurts

    Here is the summary: i ran away from my feelings and nearly broke my foot.

    Here is the article: today my husband and i fucked up. we thought some fried potatoes sounded delicious. so we let the oil heat up while we watched out lovely dogs frolic outside. we walked back into the house to find the grease literally on fire. 

my husband, the genius, thought it wise to throw flour on it. while i, the other genius, threw a cloth dish towel on it to smother the flames. 

needless to say, neither worked. the flame suddenly got much larger. i ran outside and threw it in the empty jacuzzi. 

and the house didn't burn down. 

moral of the story?

baking soda, not flour.

and a glass or metal pot lid, not a dish towel.

    Here is the article: as is customary, this fuckup happened about a month and a half ago.

it was the weekend. i wanted to just relax and not think about the world for a bit. i took a 6 pack with me into the shower (eventually bath, then shower again) and ended up lounging there listening to netflix in the other room long enough to down the entire sixer.    

when i went to get out, my legs had fallen most of the way asleep. i was ever-so-tipsy. the shower mat was crumpled up. my least favorite episode of futurama had started playing. i took one step out of the shower and slam! right into the toilet, crushing the cistern, flooding the bathroom and causing what would eventually become very apparent bodily harm. i stumbled to an upright position and eventually regained the presence of mind to turn off the water to the toilet.    

at this point i did something that made sense at the time, but which no reasonable person would ever actually do. rather than put all my towels on the floor, i spread out the two towels in the room and proceeded to fetch a bag of kitty litter from the garage and pour it all over the bathroom floor.    

it didn't help much.    

i decide at this point to just set up a couple fans in the doorway for airflow and go to bed. some hours later, at a ghastly hour of the morning i was awoken by an equally ghastly pain in my knee. i reached down instinctively to grab it, and the slightest contact revealed that  
(a. my knee had swollen to approximately 3 times its usual size  
(b. the slightest brush of the sheet against it caused agonizing pain  
and (c. that in moving my uppor body like that, i discovered an equally hideous pain in my abdomen.    

after lying there in pain for what felt like hours, but was likely minutes, i managed to grab my walking stick from beside the bed and flip on the light. the color of purple that dominated my knee and stomach was something out of a horror film, and what was worse, i could feel a huge knot forming on my stomach where the point of impact must have been.    

eventually i manged to fall back to sleep, and spent the next few days trying to keep the knee elevated and treated with ibuprofen. i ended up taking the next day off to go to the er, as the bruising seemed to be spreading and not healing.    

i explained the story to the er staff. there's no point in lying, they've heard much stupider shit. i told the admissions nurse that i thought the bruising was "severe" and that i was worried about more serious internal bleeding. i showed her, and her immediate response was  
>pff! ... .... pffhahahahaha....that's-that's not severe. don't worry.  
comforting. eventually it was confirmed that there was no permanent damage other than to my toilet. my kneecap was probably shattered but it would heal on its own if i stayed off of it.    

satisfied with this answer, i returned to my daily life for about a week until i noticed an unpleasant development: all the blood from my knee bruise had, pulled by gravity, seeped into the interstitial space of my leg. my right calf had ballooned to twice its regular size, and felt like an overstuffed sausage.    

fortunately, another few days of elevation and relaxation saw the blood disperse and the leg return to normal.

    Here is the summary: drank a 6er in the shower, slipped getting out and inflicted greivous bodily harm on both myself and my toilet.

    Here is the article: obligatory this didn't happen today, but this happened when i was in 4th grade. it was time for recess and i went outside to go play some basketball. i was with a group of like 5 people and one of them was a "big" kid. after a little bit, i had the ball and i was running so fast that i didn't notice the "big" kid and ran right into him. i thought his fat would absorb me, but instead i bounced off of him at 99 mph into the basketball hoop pole and hit my head and knocked myself out. note to self, fat doesn't absorb you.

    Here is the summary: I went outside to play basketball with a group of 5 people.

    Here is the article: hello guys, i'm a student from germany who does a lot of sports besides school, and today (yes, today!) i fucked up pretty badly.

so i am in my final high school (you can't 100% compare it to the german school system) year right now, which means there are going to be pretty important tests. and the first of these tests (maths) was today.

switch to the day before yesterday: my trainer let us do some pretty nasty jumps, like 200 of them, within less than 30 minutes. me and my mates' legs were therefore pretty fucked yesterday, to say the least.

however, tuesday is our leg day. since friends don't let friends skip leg day, me and my bro went over to the gym and excersised the hell out of our already weak legs. leg press etc., you know the stuff.

after studying a bit more yesterday, i was perfectly prepared for the first big maths exam today. usually it takes me about 15 minutes to ride my bike to school, however after that leg day combo of doom, it took me almost 25 minutes, making me come 5 minutes late. our professor gave me a killing look. 

since i was late already, i hurried to get to my place in the classroom and once i was trying to sit down on my chair, it began: my right leg started to get some small spasms, and it hurt like hell. 5 seconds later, when i almost sat down, the cramps broke out with the strongest force i've ever felt. i fell from my chair, beneath my table. i could feel everyone's eyes on me, as i silently tried not to scream out loud because of the pain.

play it cool, i thought, and with a wry smile, i got myself up again, my leg still jerking around. i already thought it would be over, but i've never been so wrong in my entire life. in a final twitch, my leg made my entire body move forward, making me lose balance and knocking my head on the (marble) table, instantly creating a huge wound that started bleeding quickly. the girl next to me started freaking out and screeching, and soon there was a doctor to transport me to the nearest hospital. this was the most embarrassing moment of my life so far, because everyone was like "wtf is wrong with him"?

i'm writing this, now that i'm back home after the wound has been stitched together (5 stitches). i have to take the exam next week, and hopefully i'll pass it. i think so though.

what is the moral of the story? never skip leg day, but never have 2 leg days in a row either. please.

this was my first (and hopefully last) tifu, i thought some of you might get a good laugh out of it.

    Here is the summary: had leg day two days in a row, in important maths exam my leg cramped, causing me to smash my head on table and bleeding as fuck.

    Here is the article: this happened last year but i thought now was a good time to share it.

i worked at a restraunt as a host and i usually try to be close with the other people i work with so its not unenjoyable for me. 6 months prior to prom for my senior prom this other hostess at my work has been dropping little hints and telling the other employees how cute i am and always telling me how she wishes someone would ask her. she started telling everyone to convince me to ask her to prom since its very taboo for the girl to ask such a question. i was very skeptical about going to prom. i simply did not want to do it. i felt it was a waste of money and time that could be spent playing video games. so 3 months before prom, i sit her down during our break and ask her to prom. she screams so the whole restraunt can here her. she hugs me and doesn't shut up about it till a day before prom. at this point i've bought the tux, dinner reservations everything. i really went all out for this girl. i've never gone to prom so this was a fresh experience for me and i couldn't comprehend my excitement. so day before prom she just stops texting and calling me. i needed to know if everything was good with the corsages? where do you want me to pick you up? well later that night i get a call from her saying her mom grounded her from going to prom. so i said as any rational man would say and told her to tell her mom to "go fuck herself" and that i'll come pick her up right now. she said she couldn't do anything about it and told me to return my tux. it all seemed very suspicious to be honest but maybe her mom was just a cold hearted bitch. so the next day i went to get my money back for the tux i haven't even taken off the rack and they said they couldn't do a refund. so i was out 150 dollars and her mom fucked me out of going to prom. or so i thought. there are a lot of people that go to the same school as my date that also went to prom that gave me information that she went to prom without me and that she found someone else last second to go with and told me to go fuck my self. she never looked at me again at work i never spoke to her again. i was beyond pissed.

    Here is the summary: girl asks me to prom and leads me on for six months, has me buy the prom essentials and ends up lieing to me and going to prom with another guy. i missed out on a once in a lifetime opportunity and i couldn't return the tux.

    Here is the article: this happened on november 10, 2015.

i went over to my friends house to celebrate the release of fallout 4. as we were waiting for the downloads to finish, we decided to go for a walk/hike. during this hike i decided to climb a huge petrified tree, about the same height as the wall. no issues, got up and down easy with no accidents. later in the walk i see a huge rock wall, about 30 feet, with all the rocks held in by metal fencing. my ego and adrenaline were raging so i instantly start my climb to the top. i didn't anticipate the slant at the top, and went to grab something that just wasn't there. so, i began falling. man it was terrifying, i had no harness or helmet so i had to think quick. mid air i oriented myself to my left side as much as i could, breaking my fall with nothing but my left foot and left hand. this bent my wrist into a u shape and my ankle was more impacted than my doctors had ever seen. will upload x-rays as soon as i have them. i was just released today, and am going back to the hospital next week to plan the rest of my surgeries. as it is, i have a cast on my wrist, as well as my ankle along with an external fixator (metal bars going through the bones to reshape my soft tissues and bones).

    Here is the article: hey guys. this actually happened almost exactly 24 hours ago, as is tradition.


anyways, i work the night shift at a local allsup's (convienant store chain in the southwest us). yesterday, i went to clean the bathroom and make mop water so i can mop the store. so far so good, but amidst all the cleaning and moving of mop buckets, i had set down my phone and wallet that were in my pockets. that's the main part of the fuck up.


so, i finish cleaning, grab my phone, and go to make coffee and start breakfast. now, for more backup, i almost always put my phone in my front right pocket, and my wallet in my front left pocket. for a reason only god knows at tbis point, i put my phone in my left pocket, and forgot to grab my wallet, as i was focused on work, and was not paying great attention. about 15 minutes pass, and a customer comes in, and asks to use the restroom, and i tell him where it is. 


well, apparently, my wallet was there. the customer must have seen the wallet on the ground, taken out the $123 cash i had in it, then set the wallet on the toilet paper dispenser. he came to the front, bought a brisk tea (not even a good one, too.), then, as he was leaving said "hey, someone dropped a wallet back there." instinctively, i patted my pocket, felt my phone, and felt my heart plummet. i ran to the bathroom, saw my wallet, and opened it to see the cash was gone. i was heartbroken. 


i know it's my fault, but it sucks. i don't normally have cash, but i had just cashed a tax return check, and was going to give it to a friend so they could order me my first mechanical keyboard. i've learned my lesson, though. don't keep large amounts of money on myself, and always triple check yourself, even if you have habits.

    Here is the summary: : i was a dumbass who forgot to grab his wallet after cleaning a work bathroom, and a customer pocketed my cash, which, honestly probably shouldn't have been in my wallet.

    Here is the article: hey guys. this actually happened almost exactly 24 hours ago, as is tradition.


anyways, i work the night shift at a local allsup's (convienant store chain in the southwest us). yesterday, i went to clean the bathroom and make mop water so i can mop the store. so far so good, but amidst all the cleaning and moving of mop buckets, i had set down my phone and wallet that were in my pockets. that's the main part of the fuck up.


so, i finish cleaning, grab my phone, and go to make coffee and start breakfast. now, for more backup, i almost always put my phone in my front right pocket, and my wallet in my front left pocket. for a reason only god knows at tbis point, i put my phone in my left pocket, and forgot to grab my wallet, as i was focused on work, and was not paying great attention. about 15 minutes pass, and a customer comes in, and asks to use the restroom, and i tell him where it is.

    Here is the article: i was around 12 years old maybe. saw a cat mauling a pigeon. it had a huge gaping hole on its back and it was very much alive. the situation demanded a quick action for the sake of animal love. i felt it was my duty to give this poor bird coup de grâce. the cat saw me approaching and went back few feet still fixated on the bird with a glaring stare. didn't want to deprive this small killer from its prey. 

how should i end this bird? there were few sticks laying around, so dooh, naturally i wacked it with the stick. my child whacks lacked the killing power and precision so i was super ineffective. the pigeon was gargling and limping on its remaining good foot and doing pigeon death noises which only stressed me. 

eventually it limped into an open basement window and fell down and the cat saw it and jumped after it. i only imagine the horror of dying in pitch blackness with a predator eating you alive.

    Here is the summary: my mercy killing ended up even worse for the killee.

    Here is the article: i was making hummous from scratch, which required me to boil chick peas for a few hours. i had them all in a pot on the stove boiling and stepped away probably to read other people's tifus, and i hear a loud hiss coming from the stove area. 

i walk over to see what's up and the foam-ish build up from boiling the chick peas had spilled over the pot and put out the flame below. no problem. i clean it up, turn the burner back on, and go back to probably reading other people's tifus. 

about 30 minutes later my mom comes home, opens the door to the house and yells "what is that smell?!" what smell? i can't smell anything. well, smells can creep on your nose and you can become adjusted to them and after a while not smell them as easily as others. 

apparently when i turned the burner back on, it was wet so it didn't ignite. rather, it spewed gas into the house for 30 minutes straight. i opened a door nearest the kitchen to let the gas out. there was so much it was billowing in huge mirage-like structures through the yard. 

took about 10 minutes to clear it. 

one single spark and i would have been severely fucked & exploded. now i just smell like natural gas.

    Here is the summary: boiled stuff, flame went out, when turned burner back on flame didn't ignite, filled house with gas, could have blown a crater in the earth with a single spark.

so i'm at walmart customer service returning two pocket hoses (they're awesome at first but they burst within weeks, 3/10 would not recommend). anyway, the customer service rep helping me is sniffling a lot, so trying to be friendly i say, "oh, poor thing, are you sick?" she says no. i press on, "oh, is it allergies?" she says no again. then she gets teary and explains, "it's...it's... my daughter ran away this morning." queue the silent overflow of tears. i feel like a bag of shit. of course i didn't stop there and rambled some apologies and what i hoped were kind words, but in the end i just walked away feeling like an ass as i type this here in the women's accessories department.

    Here is the summary: I'm at Walmart customer service returning two pocket hoses.

    Here is the article: my wife and i had a wonderful shower together.  it was disappointing that we somehow got water all over the floor and i had to use my towel on it, but oh well. 

we get to the bedroom to get dressed and something is amiss.  the are little plastic fragments everywhere and two batteries. 

while we were showering,  the puppy jumped onto my wife's nightstand and absolutely pillaged her premium $5000+ hearing aids.

she just got a new job in a grocery store, but she can't really interact with customers without her hearing aids.   i recovered from panic disorder recently,  but i had to take remnants of my medicine to keep it in check. 

now with a clear head i will most likely finance new ones so that she can continue working in the meantime.

things will be tough,  but they will turn out okay.  this does not at all devalue the current fu situation though.

    Here is the summary: don't leave hearing aids on nightstand while taking a shower with your so. a dog will eat your money.

    Here is the article: this didn't actually happen today, it happened like a couple of months ago but i only got active on reddit recently.

anyway, i am a 18 year old guy that just moved to an university city in my country last august. i have been living alone in a student room in the centre of the city ever since. so my room is located on the ground floor next to a reasonably busy street, when it is dark people can look into my room because of the lights and stuff, i obviously close the blinds usually so i can do stuff without people creepingly looking inside my room.

not this time though, i remember being quite busy with some studying at that moment but eventually i just end up on some porn site, i hadn't masturbated for a while so i got extremely horny and just got to business right away. i threw my pants and underwear off and finished like a mad man, then i just continued with studying and browsing the web. (i didn't put my pants and underwear on yet!) after about an hour i  need to pee so i get up and realise the blinds are still open, i close them immediately and realise that probably about 50 people or more could have seen me playing with my weener and sitting half naked for an hour

    Here is the summary: didn't close blinds in the night, end up jacking off and sitting without pants for an hour, figured loads of people could have seen me.

    Here is the article: of course this didn't happen today, but reading someone else's tifu about peeing reminded me of this. 

this was several years back when i was in middle school, it was near the start of summer and everyone was training for the school's track and field meet. one day, after finishing some class work, my teacher allowed me and the other runners of my class relay team outside  to practice on the field. 
after doing a few runs i needed to take a piss. i didn't want to run from the field to the school to piss and come back out. and since we were unsupervised and there was hardly anyone outside, i decided to go piss in a bush a couple meters away from where we were practicing. i let the people on my team know and they were cool with it, so i ran to the bush to do my business. 

as i start pissing in the bush, i hear some girls screaming behind me saying things like "oh mai gawd!.. that guy's peeing in a bush?!" "ewww!". (they were from another class and had come out to practice as well) i just think fuck, that's awkward, but whatever i'm not going to get in trouble from them. so i just finish up and go back to practice. 

well after finishing practice we return to class, and my teacher calls me over to talk to me. she told me that she was watching us from her classroom window to make sure we were practicing and she saw me peeing in the bush. she also had the window open as it was a hot day, and she heard the girls screaming. she just goes on to tell me that it's really disgusting to be peeing in a bush and i shouldn't do it again. but ya, i felt really embarrassed after that and it was pretty awkward.

    Here is the summary: peed in a bush in front of some girls and got yelled at by my teacher.

    Here is the article: of course this didn't happen today, but reading someone else's tifu about peeing reminded me of this. 

this was several years back when i was in middle school, it was near the start of summer and everyone was training for the school's track and field meet. one day, after finishing some class work, my teacher allowed me and the other runners of my class relay team outside  to practice on the field. 
after doing a few runs i needed to take a piss. i didn't want to run from the field to the school to piss and come back out. and since we were unsupervised and there was hardly anyone outside, i decided to go piss in a bush a couple meters away from where we were practicing. i let the people on my team know and they were cool with it, so i ran to the bush to do my business. 

as i start pissing in the bush, i hear some girls screaming behind me saying things like "oh mai gawd!.. that guy's peeing in a bush?!" "ewww!". (they were from another class and had come out to practice as well) i just think fuck, that's awkward, but whatever i'm not going to get in trouble from them. so i just finish up and go back to practice. 

well after finishing practice we return to class, and my teacher calls me over to talk to me. she told me that she was watching us from her classroom window to make sure we were practicing and she saw me peeing in the bush. she also had the window open as it was a hot day, and she heard the girls screaming. she just goes on to tell me that it's really disgusting to be peeing in a bush and i shouldn't do it again. but ya, i felt really embarrassed after that and it was pretty awkward.

    Here is the summary: I was in middle school and practicing for a track and field meet.

    Here is the article: this actually happened a month ago, but before i start i'd like to say that i'm not racist. however, i love racist jokes.

i work at a department store in arkansas. i work as a stockman. one of my responsibilities at the store is unboxing merchandise after our weekly shipment.

i was in the back unboxing product when my manager sparked up a joking conversation about silly different careers we could pursue if we didn't have our jobs. my manager then said, "well, you could always get some chickens and go into cock fighting." she laughed, i laughed. and then out of nowhere, my dumb ass decided it would be a good idea to say, "yeah, but, i think you have to speak spanish to be a cock fighter."

it was at that moment that i realized that my only hispanic coworker was unboxing clothing about 10 feet away. she heard it.

she said, "what?" i said, "what?" in return, to try and act like i didn't say it. but she's not stupid. she heard me loud and clear. now she gives me awful looks around the store, and basically won't talk to me.

    Here is the summary: i made a racist joke about hispanics with my hispanic coworker right behind me.**

    Here is the article: i started some dish water when i realized the dishsoap was missing.  remembering my husband and daughter had used it to bathe the dog earlier, i looked over at her on the couch and told her to run and get it.  usually she's very helpful, but she didn't get up right away and the sink was filling, so i added, "and step on it!"  so she finally gets up, gives me an odd look, and leisurely heads to the bathroom.  but after like a minute, she still hasn't returned, the sink is almost full, and i'm getting annoyed.  the bathroom is a room away, this is ridiculous.  she shouts something at me i don't hear, so i just yell back, "just bring it to me."  so she brings it into the kitchen and hands it to me, saying "i stepped on it a couple of times and nothing happened.  did it have a bug on it or something?"  i just stared at her until i realized she was serious, then lost it.  being the good sport she normally is, she grinned and added, "well, at least i thought to put it in the tub before i stepped on it."

    Here is the article: ok, so first off. we have had sex multiple times. she still is on the shy side of sex, me being her first. she is basically disgusted by semen, and even though its weird, i don't mind it as i understand where she's getting at.

so me and her are driving around trying to find a place to bump nastys. we come to a nice orange grove and i pull in and we start. now we change positions multiple times and we ended up in the back seat. as i'm about to finish(we have an agreement i don't finish in her but we get out of the car and she does it by hand) a car drives towards us and we immediately hop in the front seats and i'm trying to drive away and she's trying to cover herself.

we get away and we end up at a different groves. i pull in and explain i'm tired and i am about to finish. i ask if i can just lean the chair back and let her do the deed, she agrees until i ask if i can finish in her mouth. as to not get it all over the car(wink*) and she thinks for a moment and says ok. 

so she's doing her thing and as i'm about to finish i tell her. she gets in place and moments before i cum, she screams and says she doesn't want to do it anymore. within seconds, i'm cumming, shes completely let go of my member, and(because she's so thoughtful and as to not get my stuff around my car) she threw a cup which she "thought" had nothing in it. worst orgasm ever. 

now my laps full of ice water with a cup on my dick and she squirmed in the corner of the door. i just looked at her, and then accepted my fate. i just reached back for my box of napkins and started the cleanup process as she proceeds to apologize to me for what she did. i told her its ok and i understand. but fuck. i should have finished outside.

    Here is the summary: my ex gf threw a cup of cold ice water on my lap as i just started cumming. bright side, my dick got a nice cup hat.

    Here is the article: i guess, as most people do, i have to say that this didn't happen today but around this time in 2003, i was 16.

so it was coming up to my gcse exams (last compulsory exams for school kids in uk). my dad and mum were always onto me about revising. it would annoy the hell out of me; "just leave me alone i'll revise just fine". anyway, my dad has this major go at me for not revising properly and takes my ps2 off me. i go back up to my room, absolutely fuming, and as i walk in i turn my light switch on. only, i hit it with a clenched fist and crack the main square of plastic. i shit a brick and start thinking of what to do. i go tell my dad i'm popping to the shops to get some pens and pencils etc . . . for revision; this works. phew!

i go buy a new light switch for a couple of quid along with some stationery. get back to my room and proceed to change the cracked switch for the new one. i take the old switch off, no problem. i go to start attaching the wiring to the new one and as i grab one of the wires my whole body starts to vibrate it felt like i was sitting on a really shit washing machine. i managed to let go after what felt like 10 seconds (probably a second in reality) and calm myself down. i then went, tail between my legs, to my dad to tell him what had happened. he called me an idiot for not turning off the power to the upstairs and fixed the light switch for me. 
i still remember that electric shock feeling. . . scary as shit.

    Here is the summary: i broke a light switch in anger when i was 16. went to fix it myself without turning power off and touched a live wire receiving an electric shock in the process.

i go buy a new light switch for a couple of quid along with some stationery. get back to my room and proceed to change the cracked switch for the new one. i take the old switch off, no problem. i go to start attaching the wiring to the new one and as i grab one of the wires my whole body starts to vibrate it felt like i was sitting on a really shit washing machine. i managed to let go after what felt like 10 seconds (probably a second in reality) and calm myself down. i then went, tail between my legs, to my dad to tell him what had happened. he called me an idiot for not turning off the power to the upstairs and fixed the light switch for me. 
i still remember that electric shock feeling. . . scary as shit.

    Here is the summary: I was 16 and coming up to my gcse exams.

    Here is the article: so let me be clear, i am a kanye west fan and really like his music.  whether or not i am correct is an entirely different matter, but for now, let's agree to disagree.

my dad and i were watching game 7 of the nba finals together.  we've been catching all the games as, we both like it, and it makes for some good father-son time (me: 23 years old, college grad living at home, but employed, for which i'm grateful).  after an exciting first half, during the start of tv analysis, my dad asked, "hey, can i hear some of that kanye west?" 

tifu because i said yes.  here's what happened.

i had been talking a lot about kanye in the last few days.  i really liked the symphonic and grandiose parts in his last record, and "yeezus," his album that came out this last tuesday, had subverted his previous record so much i was on a "literary-critique high."  i had tried to explain to my dad how this new record was so experimental.  so first, i decided, i should play him my favorite song off his last album, "[all of the lights](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2a_wma5asss)."

my dad seemed to enjoy this.  he agreed that it was different from the rap he's heard, which, to be honest, is certainly not a lot.  so then, in my brilliant idea was to show him the first track off of "[yeezus: on sight.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53gawwemol8)"  this second song, is, lyrically, kanye being just about as obscene/ as much of an asshole as ever.  i like the song because of that, in part, and because of its crazy instrumentals.  

well, my dad did not take this well.  "what did he say?" he said, asking for clarifications on lines like, "black dick up in your spouse again," "no sports bra, let's keep it poppin'," and "but i got her back and i put my dick in her mouuuuthh."

suffice to say, he was not impressed by this "creativity," or however the fuck i had hyped it up.  the second half of the nba game was pretty silent.  

kanye, i dig it, but damn... just damn...

    Here is the summary: kanye west caused an awkward moment with my dad.

    Here is the article: today a good friend of mine came to work with me. i work at a rec center/gym, and he was looking for a new place to work out. 

as i was showing him around, he noticed a girl playing pool in our lounge. he made me stop the tour for a minute so he could gaze longingly through the window. in his defense, she was gorgeous. tall, brunette, with soft features. after a few moments of staring, she turned towards us and smiled in our direction.

my friend quickly pulled us away from the window and made me continue the tour. an hour and a half later, he was finishing up his workout, and came to my desk in the lobby.

>him: "hey, man. she's still playing pool back there"

>me: "go play with her, dude. she's cute."

>him: "are you sure?"

>me: "go for it"

the conversation continued like this for a few minutes, with me encouraging him and him having a slightly uneasy feeling about the situation. i decided to go back there with him and pretend to clean the lounge area, so i could be his moral support. 

so we head back and he tries to strike up a conversation with this girl, but she just looks confused. after a bit of awkward silence, she speaks up in french. now, i don't speak a lick of french, being a gun toting, burger gargling, freedom jockey. but my friend, a former socialist, poutine vacuum, maple syrup dumpster, does, if only a little bit.

now, let me just make sure this is clear. i don't speak french. my friend does, but only barely. his french is passable, but not great. this girl, however, in the two or three sentences in french she's suddenly blurted out, sounds perfectly fluent. i would later find out she also barely speaks french, but that's because she barely speaks. apparently french coming from a mentally disabled woman just sounds like french. who'd'a thunk it?

anywho, my friend begins conversing with her in the little french he knows. they seem to be getting along swimmingly. they're both giggling and playing pool, while i'm in the corner, enthusiastically giving my friend two thumbs up and very exaggerated head nodding motions. 

after about 15 minutes, i'm getting ready to let my little love bird leave the nest, so i can go back to the front and actually do my job. as i'm finishing up, an older woman walks into the room and motions my friend aside. i decide things are about to get good, so i pretend to dust off the airhockey table near them.

the woman spoke in a light french accent.

>her: "ah, young man, you speak french?"

>friend: "yeah, a bit"

>her: "you are flirting with my daughter?"

>friend: "sorry. i was just-"

>her: "do not be sorry. she is beautiful young lady. but you must know, she is not... all there."

>friend: "what?"

>her: "when she was ah... in me, she could not breathe. she thinks like a 9 year old"

that's when i realized that this girl's giggling and mannerisms did indeed seem very child-like. what my friend had thought was flirting was simply childish playing. 

at this point, the girl had given up pool and was twirling the arms of a foosball table around.

needless to say, my friend was pretty glum about the whole ordeal. on the drive home after work, we only mentioned it once.

>me: "that was rough"

>him: "she was cute though"

>me: "yeah, she was"

    Here is the summary: told my friend to hit on a girl. she enjoys baguettes and womb-based asphyxiation.

    Here is the article: actually happened today!  

at my school, there are 6 different scedules: it goes day 1, day 2, etc.  every day 6 during 2nd period, our whole grade meets in the theatre and discusses things.  since this is day 6 and the last class meeting before winter break, the teachers decided to play a fun "telephone" game (for those who don't know telephone is where you whisper a word or phrase into someone's ear, they whisper it into the next person's ear, and goes on for a while; the end result is normally funny).  during the first game everything went fine, but during the second game, i was the last person and was *planning* on saying the final thing.  since this is a class of around 300 people, teams were around 20 people large and the phrases were not whispered but instead put on sheets of paper.  the kid at the end of our row took the paper and proceeded to show it to the entire row, ruining the game for us and getting our team disqualified.  i went over there and told him my mind, eventually was told to go back to my seat.  i was so upset.

the next bad thing that happened was that the teacher orchestrating it decided to read all the answers.  someone put "[star wars spoiler]" for their answer, the teacher read it, and immediately the entire theatre erupted with "boo!"s and "no!"s.  we left the theatre and eventually everyone figured out who it was.  i went up to this kid (who already had a crowd around him yelling at him) and put him into a headlock and almost got him to the ground before i was pulled off of him.  then people proceeded to chase him around the school, everyone hated him so much.  i went back to our class' lounge, then one of my deans called me into her office (the offices of the class deans are inside the class lounge).  she said that even though everyone was upset that what i did was wrong.  later i heard that he was crying in the library during 3rd period, and my reaction was "good!", although that was probably not the right one.  i have 6th period geometry honors with him, and he came up to me and said "i'm so sorry, etc.".  it finally began to dawn on me that this kid was just playing a joke and didn't expect everyone's reactions to be this hostile; i started to feel bad.  near the end of 6th period our math teacher decided to hand out mini candy canes to us and star wars spoiler kid offered me his.  at this point i decided was a good time to apologize, i said "listen, star wars spoiler kid, i'm sorry for what i did after class meeting.  i don't forgive you for what *you* did, but i am sorry about what i did".  now i'm in 7th period typing this.

    Here is the summary: kid said a star wars spoiler as a joke, i tried to beat him up, felt guilty afterwards.

the next bad thing that happened was that the teacher orchestrating it decided to read all the answers.  someone put "[star wars spoiler]" for their answer, the teacher read it, and immediately the entire theatre erupted with "boo!"s and "no!"s.  we left the theatre and eventually everyone figured out who it was.  i went up to this kid (who already had a crowd around him yelling at him) and put him into a headlock and almost got him to the ground before i was pulled off of him.  then people proceeded to chase him around the school, everyone hated him so much.  i went back to our class' lounge, then one of my deans called me into her office (the offices of the class deans are inside the class lounge).  she said that even though everyone was upset that what i did was wrong.  later i heard that he was crying in the library during 3rd period, and my reaction was "good!", although that was probably not the right one.  i have 6th period geometry honors with him, and he came up to me and said "i'm so sorry, etc.".  it finally began to dawn on me that this kid was just playing a joke and didn't expect everyone's reactions to be this hostile; i started to feel bad.  near the end of 6th period our math teacher decided to hand out mini candy canes to us and star wars spoiler kid offered me his.  at this point i decided was a good time to apologize, i said "listen, star wars spoiler kid, i'm sorry for what i did after class meeting.  i don't forgive you for what *you* did, but i am sorry about what i did".  now i'm in 7th period typing this.

    Here is the summary: Today at my school, there were 6 different schedules.

    Here is the article: so, this fuck up actually happened many years ago. i was a kid in 7th grade, and back then we used to have these art classes in school. i, being terrible at anything that required fine motor skills, disliked them (i still am terrible - seems to be a genetic thing - my mum drew a lion for me as a child that looked more like a mouse suffering from clinical depression - but i digress). 

so, we were told to paint anything we felt like. i resigned myself to another hour of torture, and sat at my chair. i started painting a house, because that was all i could think of. after about fifteen minutes, my art teacher walks by. she purses her lips, sighs at the sheer ineptitude of my work, and sits down patiently next to me, offering to help. i gladly accept her offer, and turn over my sheet to her. anything, anything to escape.

she begins painting over my rectangly mess, transforming it into this beautiful building. she gets totally engrossed in it, and completely forgets that she was just supposed to give me some advice. i watch with wonder as she makes my idiotic looking "bunch of rectangles on top of other rectangles" into this magnificent mansion with spires and towers. she spends about forty minutes working on my painting alone, and it is only when the guy sitting next to me drops his paintbrush that she is brought out of her almost trance-like state.

brought back to reality, exhausted but satisfied, she looks at her work. only one small segment remains. perspiring, she points at the segment.
"just..just fill this part in p_lash. use this paint for that, and you are done."
"thank you ma'am."
i sit down, and promptly knock over half the paint bottles and the glass of water she used to clean the brush. an unholy mixture of paints, water, and the sweat of my teacher wash over the painting.
horrified, i turn to look at my teacher's face. drained of colour, shaking, she gazes at the indistinguishable brown mass where her painting once was.

she lowers her head and starts crying. the tears fall onto the sheet, leaving tiny areas of greyish-white among the chaotic mess. i immediately resolve to never touch a paintbrush again. 

i still haven't.

    Here is the summary: tried to paint, took my teacher's help, destroyed her beautiful creation in a second, realized art wasn't my thing

    Here is the article: tifu by thinking that the hour that i had before my daughter needed to be picked up from her violin class was plenty enough time to change my oil. in the first few minutes i had the drain pan under the car and the drain bolt off. it seemed like i was moving along at a good enough pace. then came the part where i needed to remove the oil filter. for the next 30+ minutes i tried to finagle my hand down between the radiator and the air intake pipes to get to the filter but the angle that i needed to bend my arm/hand just to reach the filter didn't leave room for any leverage or a good grip and the filter was not budging after being on for 6-7k miles (i use mobile 1 extended performance rated for up to 15k miles between changes). i remembered that last time i removed the filter it wasn't easy and took a good 10-15mins before it budged but this was getting ridiculous. i rattled my brain trying to figure out what i could use to get the thing to budge and i tried multiple outside the box ideas before settling on one that worked. i'll admit when i bought my daughter her first compound bow i never thought that i'd be using it in a situation like this lol. after placing a field tipped arrow down the shaft, drawing back the 30lb bow and carefully aiming at the end of the oil filter i released. success!! there was now a hole in the filter, i then carefully placed a drill bit into the hole hammered it in with a metal stake which was juust long enough to reach the bit through the metal pipes obstructing the area. i then used a yellow hook to wedge up against the bit which i then was able to hammer budging the filter loose! the rest was easy enough but damn that was close.

    Here is the summary: tifu by thinking an hour would be long enough to change my oil before my daughter needed to be picked up, ended up having to shoot the oil filter with a compound bow in order to do what i need to get it off in time.

    Here is the article: this actually happened about 15 years ago, but it remains one of the dumbest and most painful things i've ever done.  i think it belongs here.

i was living in chapel hill with a girl who worked as a delivery driver for a chain pizza place.  chain, but not super corporate.  top to bottom, it was a really laid back operation and i partied with the people she worked with and got to know the crew pretty well.  

this one time, i lost every identifying piece of paper in my life.  passport, birth cert., social security card, driver's license, etc. which, if you've ever done that, you know it is its own tifu, but never mind that.  i had to go to the dmv.  i didn't know how to get to the dmv, but i knew the address and i knew where there was a giant wall-sized map of the roads that i would need to travel.

so, i roll into the pizza place to look at the map and start shooting the shit with the staff and i get invited into the manager's office to smoke a joint.  nobody wants to be sober and go to the dmv, so i accept the invitation.  now i'm quite high and the creative side of my brain is in full effect when it's time for him to get back to work and me to get down the road.  as we are gathering ourselves to leave the office, this dude breaks out an aerosol can of what i can only describe as a most heavenly and authentic orange spray and it miraculously conceals the scent of our shared doobie.  i didn't know humankind had ever created something so divine.

my left brain says "yes, that.  i want to smell like that."
my right brain says "he may have a point.  you might not want to roll into the dmv smelling like that joint you just hotboxed in the pizza office."

why i chose my armpits, i don't know. maybe i was being funny.  maybe i was a little ripe.  i don't recall.

we slap hands.  thanks for the joint.  stop by the giant map again on the way out.  i have a plan.  going to be the best dmv trip ever.

in the car, down the road. heavenly orange scent. and then traffic.  i am stuck in traffic when i start to notice my pits are maybe not feeling great.  maybe warm and getting warmer.  oh, fuckgod no.  starting to burn now.  goddamn traffic.  i'm white-knuckling it by the time i can get turned around and headed in the direction of the house.  this jaw-clenching, white-knuckle, excruciating drive home.  every minute felt like an hour.  got home ran through a living room full of people and into the shower, alternating armpits under the cold stream for probably and hour.  my armpit skin was a mess of blisters and horror.  chemical burns.  there's no good place to get chemical burns, but i promise you the armpits is probably in the top 2 or 3 places you don't want to ever get chemical burns.  as i recall, it took a solid 2 weeks to go away completely.

    Here is the summary: got high.  was introduced to the best thing i ever smelled.  sprayed that thing in my armpits.  got chemical burns in my armpits.

    Here is the article: this actually happened about 15 years ago, but it remains one of the dumbest and most painful things i've ever done.  i think it belongs here.

i was living in chapel hill with a girl who worked as a delivery driver for a chain pizza place.  chain, but not super corporate.  top to bottom, it was a really laid back operation and i partied with the people she worked with and got to know the crew pretty well.  

this one time, i lost every identifying piece of paper in my life.  passport, birth cert., social security card, driver's license, etc. which, if you've ever done that, you know it is its own tifu, but never mind that.  i had to go to the dmv.  i didn't know how to get to the dmv, but i knew the address and i knew where there was a giant wall-sized map of the roads that i would need to travel.

so, i roll into the pizza place to look at the map and start shooting the shit with the staff and i get invited into the manager's office to smoke a joint.  nobody wants to be sober and go to the dmv, so i accept the invitation.  now i'm quite high and the creative side of my brain is in full effect when it's time for him to get back to work and me to get down the road.  as we are gathering ourselves to leave the office, this dude breaks out an aerosol can of what i can only describe as a most heavenly and authentic orange spray and it miraculously conceals the scent of our shared doobie.  i didn't know humankind had ever created something so divine.

my left brain says "yes, that.  i want to smell like that."
my right brain says "he may have a point.  you might not want to roll into the dmv smelling like that joint you just hotboxed in the pizza office."

why i chose my armpits, i don't know. maybe i was being funny.  maybe i was a little ripe.  i don't recall.

we slap hands.  thanks for the joint.  stop by the giant map again on the way out.  i have a plan.  going to be the best dmv trip ever.

in the car, down the road. heavenly orange scent. and then traffic.  i am stuck in traffic when i start to notice my pits are maybe not feeling great.  maybe warm and getting warmer.  oh, fuckgod no.  starting to burn now.  goddamn traffic.  i'm white-knuckling it by the time i can get turned around and headed in the direction of the house.  this jaw-clenching, white-knuckle, excruciating drive home.  every minute felt like an hour.  got home ran through a living room full of people and into the shower, alternating armpits under the cold stream for probably and hour.  my armpit skin was a mess of blisters and horror.  chemical burns.  there's no good place to get chemical burns, but i promise you the armpits is probably in the top 2 or 3 places you don't want to ever get chemical burns.  as i recall, it took a solid 2 weeks to go away completely.

    Here is the article: my girlfriend's parents own a lake house and often buy jet skis that never work. the ones they bought recently had an interesting decal. shocker stickers were placed on the front of each jet ski. (the shocker is where you put your ring finger down and your thumb while putting your index finger and middle finger together). sexually it is "two in the pink one in the stink." anyways, i was surprised her parents would just leave it on their jet skis and they said they thought it was sign language for 7. i explain it to them, they laugh and joke about it for a while.

moving on a couple months, girlfriends grandmother died unexpectedly and services were held a week later. this was a very emotional time for the family. the speaker for the funeral was doing his thing when he mentions that the grandmother knew sign language. he shows the sign for i,l and u. he then said combined they make i love you. he was holding up his hand and told others to do the same to tell the grandmother i love you. everyone in the room was holding up the shocker! a bunch of old people, family, and friends had no idea what it meant but my girlfriend's family did. the dad later said it just wasn't right holding up that gesture. totally ruined that moment for the family.

    Here is the summary: told my girlfriend's parents what the shocker was. gesture was held up at her grandma's funeral. ruined a special moment. ignorance is bliss.

    Here is the article: so, just like every other post on here, this fu happened about a year ago, almost to date. 
it was my 24th birthday and my mom wanted to make me dinner, and spend time with me on my birthday. cool beans, no problem. my mom had just moved back to the same state after living in fl for about 7 or 8 years, so i hadn't seen her in some time. i got ready, put the address in my gps and told my boyfriend that i would be back soon. i get to my moms apartment, and there's no parking spots... so i just park in a spot that i can find. about an hour later, i go out to the car for a smoke. my moms neighbor asked if that was my car, and i told her yes it was. here's where things go way wrong. 
my moms neighbor was nice about me taking her spot, i moved my car over and parked beside the median in the middle of the apartment complex. so, as i'm getting out of the car, the neighbor then tells me that she had called the cops about a suspicious car. my heart starts racing, and all i can think is "oh shit". she then tells me that she called the station back and told them the situation. well, me being the police-saavy person that i am, i know that there's no way that the cops are just going to not come check it out. so, i go back into my moms apartment, and try to enjoy myself. 
about an hour later cops come knocking on my moms door. she comes into the kitchen and tells me that the police are at the door asking for me. i freak, but i go to the door and talk to the officer. they ran the plates on my car, and me thinking that my bf was a stand up guy at the time i thought everything came back okay. good god, i could not have been more wrong. come to find out, the tags were stolen, and i had no insurance. niiiiiice. so i tell the officer i had no idea about it, give him all the info i can and he takes the tag and goes about his way. 
i go back into my moms apartment with this look of horror and shame, because i don't know how in the hell i'm going to get back home. 
then! my wonderful mother who always used to badger me about me being too heavy, then proceeds to tell me that my boyfriend is a p-o-s, and i must be strung out on something because i was too small, all i could do was cry. by this time i was just emotionally exhausted, i just wanted to go home. i call my boyfriend while i'm in the bathroom and tell him what happened. he freaks out, and figures out a way up to his moms work so that he can get us back home. 
i go to my sister, and tell her that i just want to go home, so she loads up her 7 kids and husband into this van and takes me to my boyfriends mom's job. we don't leave her job until 2am because she was working at the illustrious waffle house. the next day i go to get the car from my moms apartment complex, with my dad following closely behind me.

    Here is the summary: tried to have a good birthday with my mom, instead parked in the wrong spot, got my tags taken and didn't get home until two in the morning.

    Here is the article: so i initially posted this during the week, where it was removed as a violation of provisional rule 11 (and perhaps reinstated?): 

sorry if my punctuation is a bit off... i'm sorta fucked up emotionally right now.
i met this girl and i was instantly attracted to her. she and i have had this weird, off and on thing where every few months we'll make out, and we'll almost fuck, but then we both think better of it. we have a really good friendship and we're both fairly committed to not fucking that up...well, yeah.

there's a running joke between the friend and i that i'm going to fuck her mom. it started back about a year ago with me just joking around with her, like "someday you're going to wake up, and i'm just going to be in your living room in your mom's bathrobe, eating honey nut cheerios like; 'hey... i fucked your mom last night' ". it's been a running joke and the mom heard about it and would play into it. whenever i'd come by to see the daughter she'd give me a hug and a kiss on the cheek to fuck with the daughter.

so. last night, i'm at the girl's house which is kind of in the middle of nowhere and she and her mom are both drinking. we're all sitting on the couch (i'm in between them) and we're just talking... i'm covertly rubbing the chick i like's leg / ass. the night carries on and the mom keeps getting more and more drunk. the girl isn't really taking my advances so i stop. the mom starts kissing up on my neck, rubbing my back and shoulders, and just being really handsy with me.

i tell the friend about it, she laughs and says "oh, that's just how she gets sometimes." now, listen... i'm from up north and now i'm down around atl, and this is not really how people acted back home. nor was this something i've seen someone be so like "well, yeah, that's just how she is" about something. so i went back over and sat on the couch with the mom. well, mom keeps going and grabbing at me and so forth. i tell the girl that i need to gtfo.  i make up an excuse about how my g/f was waiting for me at home.  my g/f and i broke up about 3 weeks before this but i didn't really tell too many people.  i was at that point where i knew i was about to make a mistake that i couldn't take back.
i'm driving home and i get down the road and i have some wood that i need to take care of. i pull off to the side and decide to take care of it... well, this is probably where i fucked up. i texted the mom just to flirt while i'm about to do the deed, and the conversation was like "why'd you leave" and i was just hoping to get some sexy talk out of her... well i ask if she wants company.

so... i turn around and go back and well. yup.

    Here is the summary: i should have just masturbated but decided to u-turn into the girl i like's mom.

    Here is the article: 30 seconds to go in the first half in futsal (indoor soccer) and i run out from goals because we have a corner. cross comes in and i do a running header and smash my head into opposition after connecting with ball. ball gets deflected anyway, no goal, siren goes, and i have a massive headache. 

i'm walking to get a drink while holding my eye/face/side of my head. i start to feel something drip down my face, and i can tell its blood. my team mates tell me it's bad, but i expect them to fuck with me. we finish the second half, team is up and about, fired up. i check my source of pain later. skip to being in hospital, with me trying to keep blood out my eye. impending scars aren't gonna do me any favours either.

team won. and we never win so that was awesome. team name is one ton club, but that's a story for another day.

    Here is the article: so my girlfriend has been in and out of the hospital for a car accident she was in 2 1/2 months ago. this week she has been on the physical rehab floor. i rarely go home and basically live in the room with her. yesterday she was moved to an "apartment suite" room to help her be able to transition from rehab to home. this is her first hospital room with a microwave so i decided to pick up some cheap popcorn. about 3 hours ago, i go put it in the microwave and start it for 5 min. was planning on taking it out once it slowed. i'm used to getting super cheap stuff from the dollar tree that takes forever and never fills up the bag. it started slowing down after a minute 45. i decide to wait for it to quicken up again. when it doesn't speed up after about 15 seconds, i go to the microwave and can smell it. crap, i burnt it. it's smoking some but not anything out of the ordinary. i open the bag and a fair amount of smoke comes out, but nothing too out out of the ordinary. it is burnt popcorn after all. i'm worried since this is still a hospital, and it did seem slightly smoky in the room, that a nurse walking by might get worried about the smell. so i take it to the bathroom in the room so the fan will suck it up. it's not strong enough. put it in the bathroom sink to run water in it and cool it off. then my girlfriend starts freaking out that i started a "code red" (fire). i walk out of the bathroom and hear the alarms with the computer intercom going "code red, code red, room 1201." i run out the door into the hall to let someone know it's ok, there's no fire. i see the nurses come running and i start screaming, "it's just burnt popcorn! it's just burnt popcorn!". they come in and do their mandatory look around. everyone is of course relieved and starts laughing about it. it took about 5 minutes for the alarm to completely go off. apparently when a smoke alarm goes off, all the ventilation stops, so they had to have someone come in and clear the smoke away from the detector. the gentleman was laughing and very light hearted. found out the fire department gets automatically called when a code red happens. luckily they were cancelled very quickly. it also set of the entire hospital, not just the floor we are on. we are no longer allowed to make popcorn here.

    Here is the summary: i burnt popcorn in my girlfriend's hospital room and set off a code red (fire) alarm throughout the entire hospital.

    Here is the article: so my girlfriend has been in and out of the hospital for a car accident she was in 2 1/2 months ago. this week she has been on the physical rehab floor. i rarely go home and basically live in the room with her. yesterday she was moved to an "apartment suite" room to help her be able to transition from rehab to home. this is her first hospital room with a microwave so i decided to pick up some cheap popcorn. about 3 hours ago, i go put it in the microwave and start it for 5 min. was planning on taking it out once it slowed. i'm used to getting super cheap stuff from the dollar tree that takes forever and never fills up the bag. it started slowing down after a minute 45. i decide to wait for it to quicken up again. when it doesn't speed up after about 15 seconds, i go to the microwave and can smell it. crap, i burnt it. it's smoking some but not anything out of the ordinary. i open the bag and a fair amount of smoke comes out, but nothing too out out of the ordinary. it is burnt popcorn after all. i'm worried since this is still a hospital, and it did seem slightly smoky in the room, that a nurse walking by might get worried about the smell. so i take it to the bathroom in the room so the fan will suck it up. it's not strong enough. put it in the bathroom sink to run water in it and cool it off. then my girlfriend starts freaking out that i started a "code red" (fire). i walk out of the bathroom and hear the alarms with the computer intercom going "code red, code red, room 1201." i run out the door into the hall to let someone know it's ok, there's no fire. i see the nurses come running and i start screaming, "it's just burnt popcorn! it's just burnt popcorn!". they come in and do their mandatory look around. everyone is of course relieved and starts laughing about it. it took about 5 minutes for the alarm to completely go off. apparently when a smoke alarm goes off, all the ventilation stops, so they had to have someone come in and clear the smoke away from the detector. the gentleman was laughing and very light hearted. found out the fire department gets automatically called when a code red happens. luckily they were cancelled very quickly. it also set of the entire hospital, not just the floor we are on. we are no longer allowed to make popcorn here.

    Here is the summary: I go put it in the microwave and start it for 5 min.

    Here is the article: ok so obligatory "this didn't happen today" but i thought it made a pretty good story

so i had been seeing this girl for a while, incredible sex, this girl was absolutely off the chain in bed, insane libido and completely freaky so fun times were had over and over and over. 

however she also seemed to be a compulsive liar, i'd catch up with her after not seeing her for a week and there was always some sort of made up drama like a car crash (that left absolutely no damage to her car) etc. i often caught her out lying but hey the sex was good and it wasn't like i was going to wife this girl so fuck it right?

she had a number of supposed mental issues as well, the most interesting of which was her apparent lack of ability to see in the dark, meaning that if we were walking down a dark street or something i had to either carry her or walk very slowly with her holding her hand - this comes into play later


around this time my friends, her and i used to play around with a few less than legal substances before going out clubbing, and this was one of those nights. we had a big group of friends over for a mates birthday, drinks were had, a few bowls and then some lines. 


as the drinks are flowing i notice (lets call her alice) drinking quickly and heavily. as she was only 5' tall and 35kgs i could tell this would be a problem soon so advised her to ease up. 

some lines were had and more drinks and alice passed out (alice didn't have any of the less than legal stuff i should mention). i picked her up and carried her to bed and she asked what was going on, i told her that i was taking her to bed because she had passed out and clearly needed to sleep the grog off. she argued so i told her that if she could walk down our hallway (about 5m) without touching the walls she could come out. she pinballed down the length of the hallway so i told her to stay home. if she came out she was guaranteed to be refused entry which could spoil everyone's night as they would feel obligated to leave the club as well. 

i put her in bed and she seemed to realise that she should stay home and i told her i would be home in a few hours and i would wake her up and we could all keep partying at home.

i go back out and rejoin the party and get ready to hit the town. about 20 mins later as we are going to leave i check in on alice to see if she is alright and make sure she isn't going to vomit or anything... shes gone... as is my bedroom window. 

i walk out the front and me and a friend spend 10 mins walking around the block looking for her, we live in a nice area but there are scumbags everywhere and a tiny drunk chick shouldn't be walking around by herself at 11pm. i also figured she would be cut up because she had apparently kicked out my bedroom window.

we walked around for a while calling out her name but i couldn't find her, eventually i cracked the shits and decided we were all going out anyway and that if she wanted to act like a child then she could stay out in the cold for a few hours (i live in australia - by cold i mean 20 degrees celsius). 

went out, had an awesome night, came home round 3am.
lo and behold there she is, sitting on the front step pouting like a 5 year old that threw a tantrum that no one gave a fuck about. turns out she had miraculously gotten over her inability to see in the dark and walked to the nearby park (extremely dark walk) and hidden in a tree (extremely dark park, extremely dark tree climb) while i walked 2m away from her calling her name.  


i let her back inside and told her to go to bed after stealing her keys off her cause she wanted to drive. i was too angry at her to talk at that time so i told her we would talk in the morning. 
i removed the crazy first thing in the morning.

    Here is the summary: crazy fwb got trashed in my house, kicked out the bedroom window and hid in a tree for 4 hours

    Here is the article: this actually happened a few years ago when i was a sophomore in college. 

at my school its kind of a thing to try and sneak on top of the roofs around campus. i don't know if this happens other places but here it goes as far as there being a unspoken checklist of things to do before you graduate. such as outrunning one of the security guards and streaking in various locations and of course getting on all the roofs. so its a relatively big thing for those who choose to be involved. i even have a map of the campus which i put on the back of my door and cross off a location each time i accomplish something new. 

one friday night, near the end of the year, i went to this party hosted by the university. it was some classic after prom stuff with bouncy houses and other blow up activities. after i had made a pass or two at the snack table i decided i had, had enough and was ready to leave. it was just before midnight so i gathered a few of my friends from the party and left in hopes of still doing something else before the night was over. i was leaving with three of my friends, lets call them justin, robert, and jared, when another guy i knew came over and started walking with us, lets call him gerald. gerald was in some of my classes but i never really hung out with him all that much. he's super nice but he's also the kind of guy you wouldn't want to even mention getting on roofs around because you think he would disapprove. 

so the five of us now keep walking and we get on this topic and to my surprise, gerald does not disapprove at all. in fact he talks about how he has never snuck onto a roof and really wants to. i was already in the group of people i normally did this stuff with so it took nearly no convincing. we headed for the tallest building on campus. 
it was maybe 11:55pm at this point and usually these "adventures" were something for maybe 2 or 3 in the morning so you wouldn't run into any cleaners. however, none of us felt like waiting and since most of us had done it before, this was kind of a new challenge, to do it with people in the building.

when you get to this roof normally there are quite a few doors you have to "unlock" in various ways. it usually takes a bit of time to make it all the way to the roof. however this time, we got to the front door and... it was unlocked. weird but we kept going. get to the next door... unlocked. next one, unlocked. many of these weren't just unlocked but just plain wide open. something felt wrong but we kept going. we got to the catwalk that you need to cross to get to the room that has the door to the roof and again, just wide open. the path was cleared for us completely. we made it up to the roof in less than five minutes.

when we got up there robert propped the door open with one of his shoes and then we climbed the ladder to the highest level. you could see all of campus from there and most of the entire town. it a small town but it was still an amazing view. i made my way to look over the edge and the first thing i see is a cop car sitting right in front of the building. i freak out and tell everyone to go back down the ladder. we rush while still trying to be as quiet as we can. we all huddle around the door and justin opens it quietly and starts to go back in. then we see a flashlight shining through the slits in the floor. the cop was definitely on his way to the roof. justin came back on to the roof and robert put his shoe in the door again. we all went and sat in a dark corner in hopes that maybe he wouldn't see us if he came up while we were making a plan to escape. 

at this point, the door came swinging open. i thought for sure it was the cop but nobody emerged. i looked down to the base of the door and robert's shoes gently fell out of place and the same gust of wind that blew the door open, formed a giant middle finger and slammed the door shut. now we were almost hoping the cop would find us. 

in the meantime, we had called and recruited another friend of ours for a rescue mission. he had never been on the roof so we did our best to explain how to do it to him and that, oh yeah, he would have to avoid a cop. we watched over the edge for him and when he arrived he just paced in front of the building. i don't think he ever even went inside. so now i guess the plan was to wait until the cop left, or until morning, or i we all die. i don't know. 

all of us were in shorts and t-shirts since it was late spring, but the wind made it feel like it was in the low 40s. after about 30 minutes of being stuck there we had considered jumping off the roof but decided it was too tall by at least 100 feet. we thought about tying clothes together and making a rope to climb down but decided it was too dangerous. we were stumped. then i saw a light under the door swinging back and forth. i turned around and told everyone to hide. the group split up. justin, jared, and gerald hid behind a air conditioning unit about 10 feet from the door and robert and i hid behind one about 20 feet from the door. 

the door flew open and the light burst out onto the roof. i did a baseball slide behind the ac unit but it was too late. 

cop: "alright... everybody come on out."

i looked to robert and he had a look of defeat.

me: "do we do it?"

robert gave me a look like "he's a cop! of course we do!"

me: "ok yeah we do it."

so robert and i come out and start walking toward the light. jared and gerald had already come out and were standing with the cop but we could see as we walked over to them, justin still hiding behind the ac unit a mere 5 feet from the cop. 

we get over there and the first thing he asks:

cop: "so its just the four of you huh?"

nobody says anything. we don't want to lie to a cop but we also don't want to throw justin under the bus. it didn't matter though, our unified silence told him everything. he repeated.

cop: "just the four of you?"

robert: "come on justin."

justin finally came out but now the cop didn't trust us at all. 

cop: "so just the five of you huh?"

we all told him yes right away but he still searched the whole roof instead of taking our word. i can't blame him. when he came back he took all of our ids and asked us at least five times if we were throwing water balloons. we told him no and he was satisfied enough so we went to leave the roof. 

he reached for the door knob and jiggled it a bit. it didn't open. he pulled out his keys and tried to stick them in the door. 

cop: "what the hell?!?!"

he pulled out his knife and tried jamming it into the key slot. nothing worked. the lock was literally missing, as if it had been pulled out of the door. it was still locked. there was just no way to unlock it. he kicked the door and then stood there with his back turned to us. i saw him take a big breath to calm himself then he tuned around and said:

cop: "so where you guys from?"

he ended up calling a campus security guard that was off duty to come get us and we spent the next 45 minutes waiting for him talking to this cop about when he was our age and how he would do the same thing. we also found out the reason it was so easy to get up that time was because the building wasn't shut down and that happened at midnight, which is why the cop was there.

after being on that roof for maybe an hour and a half total the security guard shows up. he's an old man in maybe his 70's that is still in his pajamas which are a full body train conductor costume, hat included. he opens the door and delivers the line:

train conductor: "been a few yeeeeearrrrss since a couple o' idiots try an' get up on this roof!"

little did he know people try and succeed most nights. each of us passed him as we left the roof and apologized for making him come and get us. to which he responded by informing us that he only came because the cop was stuck on the roof too. 

we went down to the front of the building and he gave us our ids back and said we should be getting emails about a fine or community service. we spent the last two weeks of school waiting for an email but got nothing. we just assumed they let it slide since it was so close to the end of the year. it wasn't until this past year that i found out that they had mixed us up with another group that got caught that night and emailed them about our encounter. when they said they weren't the ones that got caught on that building, they were just too confused to figure it out so we got away with it due to poor communication. this past year i was at the same party and found all of the same friends except gerald and we were going to try it again but gerald ended up being out of state so we passed. 

 

edit: some spelling and grammar

    Here is the article: this actually happened a few years ago when i was a sophomore in college. 

at my school its kind of a thing to try and sneak on top of the roofs around campus. i don't know if this happens other places but here it goes as far as there being a unspoken checklist of things to do before you graduate. such as outrunning one of the security guards and streaking in various locations and of course getting on all the roofs. so its a relatively big thing for those who choose to be involved. i even have a map of the campus which i put on the back of my door and cross off a location each time i accomplish something new. 

one friday night, near the end of the year, i went to this party hosted by the university. it was some classic after prom stuff with bouncy houses and other blow up activities. after i had made a pass or two at the snack table i decided i had, had enough and was ready to leave. it was just before midnight so i gathered a few of my friends from the party and left in hopes of still doing something else before the night was over. i was leaving with three of my friends, lets call them justin, robert, and jared, when another guy i knew came over and started walking with us, lets call him gerald. gerald was in some of my classes but i never really hung out with him all that much. he's super nice but he's also the kind of guy you wouldn't want to even mention getting on roofs around because you think he would disapprove. 

so the five of us now keep walking and we get on this topic and to my surprise, gerald does not disapprove at all. in fact he talks about how he has never snuck onto a roof and really wants to. i was already in the group of people i normally did this stuff with so it took nearly no convincing. we headed for the tallest building on campus. 
it was maybe 11:55pm at this point and usually these "adventures" were something for maybe 2 or 3 in the morning so you wouldn't run into any cleaners. however, none of us felt like waiting and since most of us had done it before, this was kind of a new challenge, to do it with people in the building.

when you get to this roof normally there are quite a few doors you have to "unlock" in various ways. it usually takes a bit of time to make it all the way to the roof. however this time, we got to the front door and... it was unlocked. weird but we kept going. get to the next door... unlocked. next one, unlocked. many of these weren't just unlocked but just plain wide open. something felt wrong but we kept going. we got to the catwalk that you need to cross to get to the room that has the door to the roof and again, just wide open. the path was cleared for us completely. we made it up to the roof in less than five minutes.

when we got up there robert propped the door open with one of his shoes and then we climbed the ladder to the highest level. you could see all of campus from there and most of the entire town. it a small town but it was still an amazing view. i made my way to look over the edge and the first thing i see is a cop car sitting right in front of the building. i freak out and tell everyone to go back down the ladder. we rush while still trying to be as quiet as we can. we all huddle around the door and justin opens it quietly and starts to go back in. then we see a flashlight shining through the slits in the floor. the cop was definitely on his way to the roof. justin came back on to the roof and robert put his shoe in the door again. we all went and sat in a dark corner in hopes that maybe he wouldn't see us if he came up while we were making a plan to escape. 

at this point, the door came swinging open. i thought for sure it was the cop but nobody emerged. i looked down to the base of the door and robert's shoes gently fell out of place and the same gust of wind that blew the door open, formed a giant middle finger and slammed the door shut. now we were almost hoping the cop would find us. 

in the meantime, we had called and recruited another friend of ours for a rescue mission. he had never been on the roof so we did our best to explain how to do it to him and that, oh yeah, he would have to avoid a cop. we watched over the edge for him and when he arrived he just paced in front of the building. i don't think he ever even went inside. so now i guess the plan was to wait until the cop left, or until morning, or i we all die. i don't know. 

all of us were in shorts and t-shirts since it was late spring, but the wind made it feel like it was in the low 40s. after about 30 minutes of being stuck there we had considered jumping off the roof but decided it was too tall by at least 100 feet. we thought about tying clothes together and making a rope to climb down but decided it was too dangerous. we were stumped. then i saw a light under the door swinging back and forth. i turned around and told everyone to hide. the group split up. justin, jared, and gerald hid behind a air conditioning unit about 10 feet from the door and robert and i hid behind one about 20 feet from the door. 

the door flew open and the light burst out onto the roof. i did a baseball slide behind the ac unit but it was too late. 

cop: "alright... everybody come on out."

i looked to robert and he had a look of defeat.

me: "do we do it?"

robert gave me a look like "he's a cop! of course we do!"

me: "ok yeah we do it."

so robert and i come out and start walking toward the light. jared and gerald had already come out and were standing with the cop but we could see as we walked over to them, justin still hiding behind the ac unit a mere 5 feet from the cop. 

we get over there and the first thing he asks:

cop: "so its just the four of you huh?"

nobody says anything. we don't want to lie to a cop but we also don't want to throw justin under the bus. it didn't matter though, our unified silence told him everything. he repeated.

cop: "just the four of you?"

robert: "come on justin."

justin finally came out but now the cop didn't trust us at all. 

cop: "so just the five of you huh?"

we all told him yes right away but he still searched the whole roof instead of taking our word. i can't blame him. when he came back he took all of our ids and asked us at least five times if we were throwing water balloons. we told him no and he was satisfied enough so we went to leave the roof. 

he reached for the door knob and jiggled it a bit. it didn't open. he pulled out his keys and tried to stick them in the door. 

cop: "what the hell?!?!"

he pulled out his knife and tried jamming it into the key slot. nothing worked. the lock was literally missing, as if it had been pulled out of the door. it was still locked. there was just no way to unlock it. he kicked the door and then stood there with his back turned to us. i saw him take a big breath to calm himself then he tuned around and said:

cop: "so where you guys from?"

he ended up calling a campus security guard that was off duty to come get us and we spent the next 45 minutes waiting for him talking to this cop about when he was our age and how he would do the same thing. we also found out the reason it was so easy to get up that time was because the building wasn't shut down and that happened at midnight, which is why the cop was there.

after being on that roof for maybe an hour and a half total the security guard shows up. he's an old man in maybe his 70's that is still in his pajamas which are a full body train conductor costume, hat included. he opens the door and delivers the line:

train conductor: "been a few yeeeeearrrrss since a couple o' idiots try an' get up on this roof!"

little did he know people try and succeed most nights. each of us passed him as we left the roof and apologized for making him come and get us. to which he responded by informing us that he only came because the cop was stuck on the roof too. 

we went down to the front of the building and he gave us our ids back and said we should be getting emails about a fine or community service. we spent the last two weeks of school waiting for an email but got nothing. we just assumed they let it slide since it was so close to the end of the year. it wasn't until this past year that i found out that they had mixed us up with another group that got caught that night and emailed them about our encounter. when they said they weren't the ones that got caught on that building, they were just too confused to figure it out so we got away with it due to poor communication. this past year i was at the same party and found all of the same friends except gerald and we were going to try it again but gerald ended up being out of state so we passed.

    Here is the article: context: i'm an intern. i'm doing a gap year with a software company that is based in the us and i am essentially just a lackey. however, what sold me on giving a year of my life was the promise that i would get to go live in australia and work for one of their customers for a few months. they delivered, and here i am. i'm living in a corporate apartment not far from the office. now, my boss, let's call him ahkmed, has come to finish up a deal and work with some of the handover from our customer's it department that just got laid off to us. now our customer, we'll call him mufasa, is best friends with ahkmed. he loves to be the life of the party and is a lot of fun to be around. he's super offensive and loves to make fun of my americanisms, but he is a great dude. he's also my company's biggest customer.

fuck up: we went out to dinner with mufasa and other customers, and we were eating dinner at a restaurant down the street from the office. we were discussing what my impression was of australia a month in. i said that i was a bit lonely, except for the leech of a guy they had stay in my apartment the past week. i said "i think he's the only aussie i've ever met who i didn't actually like." to which mufasa replied, "besides me" to which we all started laughing. then, i said, "yeah, you're right, you're an asshole." i'd had a few beers, so i didn't think it was a big deal. ahkmed said "you really are adjusting well!" and other people thought it was funny, but i think i actually might have hurt mufasa's feelings. he laughed it off and i apologized, and the night proceeded normally. i continued to talk to mufasa the whole night with no feeling of wrong doing, but i feel like a total dick. i'll apologize to everyone when they come into the office. update to come.

    Here is the article: let me start off by saying that my wife has a fantastic fanny and that we regularly like to play slap ass.

this actually happened a few years ago, but i am only a recent reddit member. my now-wife and i were in her basement bedroom packing up her belongs and cleaning her closets out for when we soon moved in together. i was casually helping out by vacuuming, although admittedly i wasn't particularly interested in getting anything done with any urgency or organization.

my wife was buried in her closet tossing out old hats and such to donate when i hear a muffled request to go upstairs and grab another bag. no problem. now, i mentioned her room was in the basement but i didn't mention that there are two entrances: one is the back staircase and one (much cooler) is a ladder that leads directly up to the second floor. i, being much cooler, take the awesome pirate ladder.

i get upstairs, go to the kitchen and see my wife's mother (who, at the time, hated my existence. face piercings tend to do that) fiddling with something at the sink. "oh, hi mrs. smith. could i please have another trash bag?"

she gives me the bag and i head back to the awesome fireman ladder, put the bag in my teeth to carry down, and descend. as i get to the bottom, i see that my wife has crawled out of her closet and is over in the doorway looking towards the back stairs. of course, when your so is presenting their exquisite posterior, the only proper thing to do is to greet it with a firm, hearty slap, much like a world series winner might give or a  buzzer-beating-3-point scorer might receive. not a squeeze. not a rub. a nice, healthy, "man, we've got somethin' to celebrate" kind of *kawhap.*

maybe it was the poor lighting, maybe it was the clutter of a room being torn apart, or maybe it was my lousy sense of perception, but all of a sudden, i realize something has gone terribly wrong. i see my wife step out of the closet where she was before, not at the end of my fingertips like i had previously thought. my eyes slowly widened and i realized that the juicy, sweet, sexy palmful of lovin' i just delivered was in fact not experienced by my lovely wife, but by my wife's mother. dread filled the pit of my soul as she slowly turned around as if a thief had her at knifepoint. i managed to squeak out, "i'm... so... sorrrrryyyy."

my wife laughed like she just had her wisdom teeth yanked out.

to this day i don't know how my mother-in-law managed to get from the kitchen upstairs, down the back stairway, through the basement and into my wife's room before i was able to climb down one little ladder. i doubt i'll ever discuss it with my mother-in-law and get her perspective of the events. i take solace in the fact that this must mean that my wife has some good genes and that i'll be slapping that ass for many years to come.

    Here is the summary: mistook my mother-in-law for my wife. slapped her ass. regretted it.

    Here is the article: let me start off by saying that my wife has a fantastic fanny and that we regularly like to play slap ass.

this actually happened a few years ago, but i am only a recent reddit member. my now-wife and i were in her basement bedroom packing up her belongs and cleaning her closets out for when we soon moved in together. i was casually helping out by vacuuming, although admittedly i wasn't particularly interested in getting anything done with any urgency or organization.

my wife was buried in her closet tossing out old hats and such to donate when i hear a muffled request to go upstairs and grab another bag. no problem. now, i mentioned her room was in the basement but i didn't mention that there are two entrances: one is the back staircase and one (much cooler) is a ladder that leads directly up to the second floor. i, being much cooler, take the awesome pirate ladder.

i get upstairs, go to the kitchen and see my wife's mother (who, at the time, hated my existence. face piercings tend to do that) fiddling with something at the sink. "oh, hi mrs. smith. could i please have another trash bag?"

she gives me the bag and i head back to the awesome fireman ladder, put the bag in my teeth to carry down, and descend. as i get to the bottom, i see that my wife has crawled out of her closet and is over in the doorway looking towards the back stairs. of course, when your so is presenting their exquisite posterior, the only proper thing to do is to greet it with a firm, hearty slap, much like a world series winner might give or a  buzzer-beating-3-point scorer might receive. not a squeeze. not a rub. a nice, healthy, "man, we've got somethin' to celebrate" kind of *kawhap.*

maybe it was the poor lighting, maybe it was the clutter of a room being torn apart, or maybe it was my lousy sense of perception, but all of a sudden, i realize something has gone terribly wrong. i see my wife step out of the closet where she was before, not at the end of my fingertips like i had previously thought. my eyes slowly widened and i realized that the juicy, sweet, sexy palmful of lovin' i just delivered was in fact not experienced by my lovely wife, but by my wife's mother. dread filled the pit of my soul as she slowly turned around as if a thief had her at knifepoint. i managed to squeak out, "i'm... so... sorrrrryyyy."

my wife laughed like she just had her wisdom teeth yanked out.

to this day i don't know how my mother-in-law managed to get from the kitchen upstairs, down the back stairway, through the basement and into my wife's room before i was able to climb down one little ladder. i doubt i'll ever discuss it with my mother-in-law and get her perspective of the events. i take solace in the fact that this must mean that my wife has some good genes and that i'll be slapping that ass for many years to come.

    Here is the summary: I was helping my wife pack up her belongings for our upcoming move.

    Here is the article: first post ever so forgive me if i missed something. i'm also posting on mobile so sorry if the formatting is messed up. 

let's start with me and a girl. i'm a graduating student merely days away from officially getting a degree. i'm friends with a girl who graduated last october. this girl, let's call her jane, had been having serious problems for a while and she has had a pretty heavy life lately and i've helping her keep it together. shortly after she finished, her mom got diagnosed with  cancer. sadly she died after a few months. now she doesn't have  a job and has been struggling for a while so i've been helping her out financially when i can while she deals with employment and her parents legal issues (her father died years prior). we've been keeping the whole financial thing a secret to avoid gossip, especially in my country, gossip is crazy. recently she found out her father is still alive and had abandoned her family the whole time, so inheritance became really complicated. bad enough she can deal with her finance and employment problems, now her dad practically came back from the dead.

now this is all really heavy for me, and it was starting to show. a few weeks back, during a couple of drinks,  my friends noticed and asked me what's going on. 

see, people trust me with secrets and i keep my mouth shut when i have to. but i've been having financial problems of my own involving my family. i have a bad habit of keeping everything inside, so over the years i found a way to let it out without directly telling people: i lie. 

well, more like half truths. i get all the things that have been bothering me the most and put them together in a convincing manner. i don't necessarily say everything, but it makes me feel better without directly saying things i'm not supposed to say. 

so i told them a story about how this guy, let's call him john, owes me money, regarding a separate incident regarding jane. 

because a few nights back john  owed jane money for a really stupid reason and she needed to pay because jane's friend might lose her job. so i helped out jane, which in turn, worsened my budget. 

i got pretty angry while telling the story so i blamed john instead of jane for my budget problems. which was not really true. my budget problems are a separate matter, but i care about this girl and i'm willing to put her first. i blamed john because i didn't want to blame jane, it's bad enough she already sees herself as a burden to me and i don't want to be angry at her, so i projected my anger towards john. 

but one of my friends, let's call him richard, is actually in the same frat with john, it it eventually reached him . they hated each other but i never realized how close they are with each other lately. john had always had a temper so we had a confrontation. i didn't want to drag jane into this because she has finally found a job and doesn't need anymore issues. 

so me, john, richard, another friend of mine talked it out today. i admitted i lied and said a story to make myself feel better and that my anger towards john was misplaced because i don't want to direct my frustrations towards jane, due to all the things she had been going through. everybody found out about her situation because of me. 

later, jane found out and she got really emotional about it. she got really angry at me and all the issues that surfaced surrounding us. things got really heavy earlier and it's been really hard for me to say all this. i've just really needed to get this out there because now i have no one to go to. 

 

i have no one to go to now because i never completely trust people due to fear of situations like this, and now even worse because of situations like this, the only person i care for is angry at me, and i can't keep something like this inside. 

i may have intentionally left some things out. i hope you understand why. but if you're reading this (a part of me hopes your not), thank you for hearing me out. 

ps. i may come back to delete this because my trust issues are starting to skyrocket.

    Here is the summary: i lied about something really big, it got out of hand, everybody found out, i may have committed social suicide before my graduation, and the girl i did all this for is angry at me.

    Here is the article: this happened tuesday this week, haven't had time to post it yet...and i'm still not quite over it    

little back story, i am from texas but living in a unheard of city in russia, working in the oil industry. my so is russian/american who is currently in the us visiting family for 2 months but headed back here soon. we have been together for awhile now and she is slowly trying to get me to be more stylish, new clothes, no more cowboy boots, new hairstyle etc. and trying to get me to learn more russian since i live here, she is right on all points, especially the learning russian bit...  

last sunday morning i was in desperate need of a haircut so i asked her to send me a few photos of what style she wanted my barber to cut for me and i saved them in my camera roll, this conversation was early on sunday morning and since she has been gone for more than a month naturally i woke up with morning wood and snapped a couple of photos for her viewing pleasure.      

i forgot all about the photos until the day my haircut appointment rolled around. since my barber doesn't speak any english, and i speak very little russian i google translated and printed instructions for what i wanted, "long on top, short on the sides, current trendy la style blah blah, and i have a few picture examples of what my girl wants me too look like to show you" (david beckham was the example photos...i look nothing like him btw).  

so day of the appointment i walk in, give my butchered russian greetings and sit down, hand him the note i wrote him and then open my photos to scroll through the pics, i find the first one of beckham and as i am scrolling through with my right hand with my phone over my shoulder so he can see the pics, i am looking at him in the mirror and explaining to him how i want it cut in sign language and the few russian words i know, i scrolled through two pictures and then i see his face change and his eyes grow wide...not knowing why i looked at the pic on my phone and there is my колбаса (russian for sausage kolbasa) in all its morning glory. i couldn't close it fast enough and then, because of the language barrier i couldn't explain to him that i was not showing that to him on purpose, all i could think to say was хорошо? (which basically means "good?") and his reply was хорошо!! with a smile...  

so, he proceeded to cut my hair and it was the most awkward and longest haircut of my life, mainly because he smiled a lot more than usual during this haircut, and his reply had me wondering the whole time if he liked the haircut style or the pic of my one eyed wonderwood...i shudder to think this but maybe he liked what he saw...and thats not even legal in russia! 

i told my so about this that night on skype and she naturally laughed her ass off...i'm still embarrassed and think i will have to find a new barber for my next haircut...hopefully a woman this time...

    Here is the summary: showed my barber a pic of morning wood and he liked it...

i forgot all about the photos until the day my haircut appointment rolled around. since my barber doesn't speak any english, and i speak very little russian i google translated and printed instructions for what i wanted, "long on top, short on the sides, current trendy la style blah blah, and i have a few picture examples of what my girl wants me too look like to show you" (david beckham was the example photos...i look nothing like him btw).  

so day of the appointment i walk in, give my butchered russian greetings and sit down, hand him the note i wrote him and then open my photos to scroll through the pics, i find the first one of beckham and as i am scrolling through with my right hand with my phone over my shoulder so he can see the pics, i am looking at him in the mirror and explaining to him how i want it cut in sign language and the few russian words i know, i scrolled through two pictures and then i see his face change and his eyes grow wide...not knowing why i looked at the pic on my phone and there is my колбаса (russian for sausage kolbasa) in all its morning glory. i couldn't close it fast enough and then, because of the language barrier i couldn't explain to him that i was not showing that to him on purpose, all i could think to say was хорошо? (which basically means "good?") and his reply was хорошо!! with a smile...  

so, he proceeded to cut my hair and it was the most awkward and longest haircut of my life, mainly because he smiled a lot more than usual during this haircut, and his reply had me wondering the whole time if he liked the haircut style or the pic of my one eyed wonderwood...i shudder to think this but maybe he liked what he saw...and thats not even legal in russia! 

i told my so about this that night on skype and she naturally laughed her ass off...i'm still embarrassed and think i will have to find a new barber for my next haircut...hopefully a woman this time...

    Here is the summary: I am from texas but living in a unheard of city in russia, working in the oil industry.

    Here is the article: throw away because, you know...i shit myself. it literally happen around...13 mins ago(minus the typing). i wanted to take a picture of my brown stained jeans. but i realized i'm in public and the stench is invigorating...except in a negative way. anyways i was walking to the bus stop(driving test next week.) and waiting for the bus. i got on and i felt something wrong. kinda like a motion sickness kinda way. i reached my college and now i'm going to class. as i approached the door, i felt like i needed to fart. so i proceed to do so. but this one is a tough one. i mustard all my might and obliterated my boxers with shat. i froze, i'm 3 inches from the door way to my class. i feel the liquid shat drizzle down my boxers down to my right thigh. it felt lukewarm. the texture felt like the cross between water and dijon mustard. people looked at me. i not sure if they smell it. but oddly my new jeans was taking it quite well. i just washed it and using 2 cups of detergent and 5 sheets of softener sheets before shitting in it. so the glade smell is quite strong in this one. i slowly reversed my steps. luckily the bus came in just in time. i paid the fare. sat down on my shat. and waited. a lady sat near me, she started to question the smell. she said "wow, it smells like clean clothes! is that you?". i nodded. when the door open i quickly ran to my house, unlocked it. pants off. the smell was a mix of ass and a strong frebreeze hybrid glade. i stuffed it in the washer for 50 mins. never again i'm trusting my farts again.

    Here is the summary: trusting a fart. shat myself. lady loved the smell of ass.

    Here is the article: quick background: this happened in august of 2014. i was searching on craigslist for a used graphics card to replace my current one, and finally found someone who was selling one for a decent price. so i contacted him (we'll call him toby) and agreed to meet at his house. i know that meeting at people's houses is a very bad idea, but i wanted to make sure the card worked, and wasn't going to drag my whole pc into a starbucks.

so, this whole fuck up starts with a text he sends me on the day we are going to meet. i don't have the exact message, but it went something like this: "[insert address here]. when you arrive, there will be a green subaru on the left. park behind it, walk around to the back of the house, call me, and i'll have my roommate let you in"

i joked about how creepy the text sounded with my dad on the way over to toby's house. (i'm a 17 year old male, 6'3", 200lbs, but my dad still insists on going to craigslist meetups with me).

so we arrive at toby's house, and immediately notice that his front door is covered in yellow "caution" tape and has a sign that says "disabled. all deliveries to back door". so we park behind the subaru, like he asked, and proceed to walk around behind the house. once in his backyard, we could see the door frame where his backdoor should be. in it's place was an industrial sized fan. i call toby, and he tells me to go inside (into his kitchen - which was piled ceiling high with dirty dishes, cans, boxes, and various garbage), then make a right where i will see a door with a keypad and gold handle. he assured me that the keypad didn't work, and that i was to go in through that door and close it behind me. my dad is very sensitive to bad smells, and i could tell that the kitchen smell was really making his stomach churn, so i told him i'd be fine going alone. 

i went in and closed the door behind me, only to be greeted by a staircase as well as the awful foul smell of cat feces and vomit. all the way up the stairs there were wet spots of what i presumed was cat puke. at the top of the stairs, there was a pitch-black l-shaped room (i entered at the top of the l). i can't see anything, but i hear this super raspy voice say "[my name], come on over here". i was a little sketched, but i walked into the darkness; whether out of bravery or foolishness i still don not know. right as i turn at the bottom of the l, a large tv turns on, and lights up the room. 

ever seen something that you wish you could un-see? yeah, this was one of those moments.

toby himself probably weighed 450lbs, and looked like the offspring of jabba the hut and a large, deformed pancake. all around his room there were half-eaten boxes of pizza, vodka, condiments, various medications, e-cigarettes, and nearly anything you could imagine piled high to the ceiling. luckily, i was able to conceal my horror and disgust long enough to get the graphic card and leave the horrible, smelly, diseased place. but it doesn't end there.

i get home, and inspect the card (which i really should have done earlier, because it's not like i can return it now). being a 780ti reference card, there is a small window on the side allowing you to see the heatsink. but this window was completely covered in dust. so, i thought it would be a great idea to hook it up and run the fans at 100% to blow all the dust out into my room.

 but... that dust is the accumulation of all the airborne shit that has been floating around in toby's room for the last 3 months... long story short, i got really bad chest pains and could barely breath the next day, and had to stay home from work for 2 days.

    Here is the summary: bought a graphics card from a disabled man who lives in very gross conditions. blew 3-months worth of accumulated dust out into my bedroom and nearly got bronchitis.

    Here is the article: this happened over the course of the last four months, i am a student at a university about two hours of bus ride away from my home. i had been traveling to the university every day for three years, but it wasn’t going well at all. not only am i extremely lazy, i also had to take the bus ride from hell every day. the road had gone to hell and the busses looked like they had gone a few rounds with a t-rex, a few times during its wretched existence (yay! third world problems). i wasn’t allowed to take part in the last two semester finals, owing to my low attendance levels.

i finally had enough and got a hostel accommodation for the new semester. it a two person room, so i had a roommate. i went down to the room, met with the roommate, we exchanged introductions and i moved in. now, being an extreme case of social awkwardness, i do not do well with strangers and usually make do with nods and shakes of the head, and a few well timed hmm*s*. i also avoided going to the room as much as i could, only going in to sleep and leaving early in the morning. i also left for home as soon as the final class of the week was done, and came back on the morning of the next one. our conversations were limited to the exchange of pleasantries, and to me waking him up in the morning to have him close the door when i leave.

i was at home after about four months of this and my brother asked me to help out a friend of his friend who just got admitted, and needed help settling in to the university. as i wasn’t at the university i thought of asking the roommate to help the guy out. so i texted him and he agreed to help the guy out. when i was telling my brother about the guy who is going to help, it dawned on me: i am not sure what the guy’s name is. i wasn’t sure if his name was “hamad” or” amaar”. i had saved his number as “amaar” and had been calling him that for four months and he hadn’t corrected me, but i also recalled somebody calling him “hamad”.

told my brother i wasn’t sure between the two names, cue ridicule, he told his friend, cue ridicule *again*. he told the friend in need. he met with the guy and told my brother his name was “hamad”. i will not be living this one down.

    Here is the summary: called my roommate by the wrong name for four months, found out his name through my brother and his friend, embarrassment followed.

    3. Rate the summary with 5 percentages, where each one represents how likely the summary is going to get a score from 1 to 5. For example, if you think the summary is 80% likely to get a score of 5, 10% likely to get a score of 4, 5% likely to get a score of 3, 3% likely to get a score of 2, and 1% likely to get a score of 1, you should rate the summary as 80, 10, 5, 3, 2.

    Here is the article: this happened over the course of the last four months, i am a student at a university about two hours of bus ride away from my home. i had been traveling to the university every day for three years, but it wasn’t going well at all. not only am i extremely lazy, i also had to take the bus ride from hell every day. the road had gone to hell and the busses looked like they had gone a few rounds with a t-rex, a few times during its wretched existence (yay! third world problems). i wasn’t allowed to take part in the last two semester finals, owing to my low attendance levels.

i finally had enough and got a hostel accommodation for the new semester. it a two person room, so i had a roommate. i went down to the room, met with the roommate, we exchanged introductions and i moved in. now, being an extreme case of social awkwardness, i do not do well with strangers and usually make do with nods and shakes of the head, and a few well timed hmm*s*. i also avoided going to the room as much as i could, only going in to sleep and leaving early in the morning. i also left for home as soon as the final class of the week was done, and came back on the morning of the next one. our conversations were limited to the exchange of pleasantries, and to me waking him up in the morning to have him close the door when i leave.

i was at home after about four months of this and my brother asked me to help out a friend of his friend who just got admitted, and needed help settling in to the university. as i wasn’t at the university i thought of asking the roommate to help the guy out. so i texted him and he agreed to help the guy out. when i was telling my brother about the guy who is going to help, it dawned on me: i am not sure what the guy’s name is. i wasn’t sure if his name was “hamad” or” amaar”. i had saved his number as “amaar” and had been calling him that for four months and he hadn’t corrected me, but i also recalled somebody calling him “hamad”.

told my brother i wasn’t sure between the two names, cue ridicule, he told his friend, cue ridicule *again*. he told the friend in need. he met with the guy and told my brother his name was “hamad”. i will not be living this one down.

    Here is the summary: I had been traveling to the university every day for three years, but it wasn’t going well at all.

    Here is the article: i live in a house that seems like the builders were on drugs while working. it required a lot of tinkering in the last couple of years (correcting the orientation of light switches that are placed sideways, rewiring lamps so that they actually illuminate meaningful spots, replacing door frames etc.), so i developed the habit of just watching a couple of youtube videos and fixing stuff myself.

so when one of the bulbs exploded on the stairway, i just went ahead and turned the electricity off from the main circuit switch of that section of the house. i grabbed [this shade](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/ee/83/1d/ee831d9869c4957ec1a4e6804afd0bf9.jpg) with one hand and tilted it up so that i was directly looking into the remaining socket of the exploded bulb. then, i proceeded to removing it with a plier.

turns out i turned off the wrong circuit switch, because the stairway happens to be included in an irrelevant section. the moment the tip of the pliers touched the inside of the socket, it went off with a massive bang along with a blinding light. i was basically holding it 30cm to my face.

the stairs were already dark, so the flash completely obscured my vision. when i gathered my senses, i was falling sideways, because my body was trying to escape, while my feet were obstruced by the stairs and i couldn't execute the necessary string of movements required to climb a single step of a stair.

so, as a result of an attempt to be the man of a house that is not meant to have a man:

the pliers are gone. luckily the handle was plastic.  
i have a persistent blotch in my field of view in the shape of the electrical spark. it's gradually getting better though.  
i bruised myself by falling during the initial disorientation.  
the main fuse of the house is burnt. had to pay absurd amounts of money to have a replacement during this snow storm.  
when the fuse was fixed, it turns out the portion of the circuitry that included the lamp was burnt as well, so the lamp still doesn't work and the house is slightly less functional than it used to be before my repair.

------
edit: thank you for all the suggestions. i usually read it twice before posting, this time i just wrote and submitted and i see that it caused some ambiguity. i had no way of ensuring that the light was off by turning off the switch, because it is controlled by two independent switches; one at the beginning and the other at the end of the stairs. so they don't have predetermined on/off positions. also usually i'm way more cautious with this stuff, because, well i like being alive, but the major brain fart was not knowing better and assuming the light fixture was connected to an mcb that controlled everything else in its vicinity. things usually are grouped by proximity, but it was idiotic to assume, hence the fuck up.

edit2: i can't give much in terms of visual evidence, because the electricians asked if i'd like them to throw the broken stuff to the dump on their way, so i said sure why not. but [this](http://i.imgur.com/s3sbmoo.jpg) was left. doesn't show any physical damage from outside but yeah, there's that.

    Here is the summary: i tried to replace a burnt out bulb. the lamp turned into a makeshift stun grenade that went off to my face. burnt several portions of the circuitry of the house. the lamp still doesn't work.

    Here is the article: this really happened today, because i'm dumb and didn't learn from my friends mistakes. not so much of a fuckup as it was a massive pain in the ass for what should have been a simple process. 

got a prepaid 12 mo card for live, wanted to cancel the auto renew of my monthly subscription because- fuck them, why would i need both?

so i go on the site, carefully navigate the minefield that is the faq to make sure i do it right (even though really- how hard could it be?)

find the right section, open a new tab and start following the instructions- easy peasy super-sleezy right?

wrong. so wrong. get to the end of the process and hit confirm- congratulations on your purchase of a monthly auto-renewing xbox live subscription ya dope! we sure fooled you!

while i'm counting to ten and trying to tell myself that didn't just happen, an email notification pops up on my phone confirming just cause for a long, loud, nonsensical string of obscenities.

my big brother who just went to bed joins me in the living room- is a programmer from a prestigious college and spent a few years in tech support, i'm usually good with this stuff but microsoft is like an obsessed girlfriend who doesn't let you go easy. or at all. in fact i've got at least three or four buddies who've complained of the same thing happening to them over the past couple of years (years dammit!), so i should have known better. (see above statement about microsoft's clingy nature)

brother to the rescue! he goes through it and gets through a different set of screens this time, (a ray of hope!) 

-email confirmation pops up of another subscription purchase, ray of hope is actually microsoft giving us a golden shower, both of us start cursing. now it's a pride thing for him at this point so he keeps trying to make it work, you know how it is. 

after another half hour he hands my phone back to me, defeated- a hollow shell of the man he once was, bested by the enemy. 

mandatory "thanks for taking the time and trying"- i figure i'm pissed but it's no problem- it's $20, possibly a recurring $30 at the end of the month, but i'll just call tech support and lose my shit that it's been like this for years and they need to fix it. and give me back my money. now.

find tech supports' number- closed. their hours of operation ended  litterally one minute before. proceed to lose my shit.

decide to put on my big girl panties and just call them when i get up, i'll be more pleasant then anyways.

called about an hour ago (weird work schedule) got a sweet lady who was professional and efficient, refunded my money(turns out it only charged me once, which is cool), told me to call back once i recieve the refund so they can remove my card info to avoid any further complications, and that she would talk to the appropriate persons about the ongoing issue to see about getting it fixed.

so now it's settled, but i still feel pretty stupid. learn from my mistake.

    Here is the summary: to cancel an auto renewing live subscription you have to call tech support, the idea of self service is a lie.

    Here is the article: this didn't happens today like any other tifu, but last week. i'm just starting to be active on reddit instead of anonymously reading all the time so i thought this one is funny and people can maybe learn from my mistake.  [quick information] i'm working on a mega yacht 106 meters and it is rented out to very rich people. usually they are all billionaires because it costs around 1 million to rent the boat without fuel, food and etc. i'm new in this industry but i know that it is usually only 2-3 weeks we have the guests on board but this time a very rich guy from dubai rented the boat for 1,5 months. first time that has ever happened.. no worries. 

anyways they are surprisingly the nicest rich people i've ever met! so grounded although we have one guy (let's call him tim) who's crazy energetic and wants the jet skies in the water and the next hour he wants a massage and then dive after - very active guy. one of the day they all went partying so we knew we had some time off in the morning so we were "secretly" going on shore to get a haircut since we're almost one month in this charter. it all felt like we were under cover because it had to be fast and quick! 
we came back to the boat and everything was good and the thing about me is that i'm very paranoid and i usually never make up anything but i made up a reason to why i all of a sudden got my hair cut in case the guests would notice. i just had a feeling that tim was going to say something - didn't know what, but i felt like he would notice and say something. and he did - he said "nice hair" or something and started asking where i got it! my heart started to beat a little faster because now i had to lie to him. - i know that they used to have a stewardess that also is a hairdresser but this year they got a bartender instead so that's why i told him - " uuhmm i just got one of the stewardesses to cut my hair" finishing the sentence with " she's pretty good." as i said that my heart was running like the sound of an helicopter in a storm! he wanted me to call her down to the deck we were on - not for a haircut though but he wanted to get his beard lined up or something. there i'm standing caught right on the spot he's waiting for me to call someone we don't even have on the boat! i turned my back and had my radio to my mouth i called for a jenny over the radio - we don't have any called jenny but i didn't push the button so my co workers couldn't hear it. i told him to wait there and i would get her. i ran to the chief officer who's a very nice guy and he was laughing while i stood there sweating like a rapist. he told me that if tim asks for it again i could call the officer again and then he would speak to him. i later heard that he did ask the interior workers for it and then they just said that they don't have any hairdresser on the boat and they told me he just started laughing. i haven't heard more from him but karma was really a bitch that day but i kinda deserved it.

    Here is the summary: working on a yacht without a haircut for a long time. got asked by a guest to who i lied to but got caught right on the spot in the most awkward way.

    Here is the article: this didn't happens today like any other tifu, but last week. i'm just starting to be active on reddit instead of anonymously reading all the time so i thought this one is funny and people can maybe learn from my mistake.  [quick information] i'm working on a mega yacht 106 meters and it is rented out to very rich people. usually they are all billionaires because it costs around 1 million to rent the boat without fuel, food and etc. i'm new in this industry but i know that it is usually only 2-3 weeks we have the guests on board but this time a very rich guy from dubai rented the boat for 1,5 months. first time that has ever happened.. no worries. 

anyways they are surprisingly the nicest rich people i've ever met! so grounded although we have one guy (let's call him tim) who's crazy energetic and wants the jet skies in the water and the next hour he wants a massage and then dive after - very active guy. one of the day they all went partying so we knew we had some time off in the morning so we were "secretly" going on shore to get a haircut since we're almost one month in this charter. it all felt like we were under cover because it had to be fast and quick! 
we came back to the boat and everything was good and the thing about me is that i'm very paranoid and i usually never make up anything but i made up a reason to why i all of a sudden got my hair cut in case the guests would notice. i just had a feeling that tim was going to say something - didn't know what, but i felt like he would notice and say something. and he did - he said "nice hair" or something and started asking where i got it! my heart started to beat a little faster because now i had to lie to him. - i know that they used to have a stewardess that also is a hairdresser but this year they got a bartender instead so that's why i told him - " uuhmm i just got one of the stewardesses to cut my hair" finishing the sentence with " she's pretty good." as i said that my heart was running like the sound of an helicopter in a storm! he wanted me to call her down to the deck we were on - not for a haircut though but he wanted to get his beard lined up or something. there i'm standing caught right on the spot he's waiting for me to call someone we don't even have on the boat! i turned my back and had my radio to my mouth i called for a jenny over the radio - we don't have any called jenny but i didn't push the button so my co workers couldn't hear it. i told him to wait there and i would get her. i ran to the chief officer who's a very nice guy and he was laughing while i stood there sweating like a rapist. he told me that if tim asks for it again i could call the officer again and then he would speak to him. i later heard that he did ask the interior workers for it and then they just said that they don't have any hairdresser on the boat and they told me he just started laughing. i haven't heard more from him but karma was really a bitch that day but i kinda deserved it.

    Here is the article: now this isn't a fuckup because of my initial actions but rather because it could of ended in dire consequences.

so today on my commute to work i was happily driving along in a long line of cars doing the speed limit when all of a sudden i see a troublemaker in his hatchback van speed up behind me. when people do this it's usually blatantly obvious they want to overtake you and i could see the way he was looking around that he was going to try at some point. despite the fact we were in a long line of cars and overtaking me would literally get him in front of my bumper and no further i decided i didn't want to let him do this...

as he went for the overtake i dropped into 3rd gear and sped up, closing the gap between me and the car infront of me so he couldn't squeeze in. he just kept driving along at a level speed on the wrong side of the road until he had to drop in behind me before getting crushed by incoming traffic. i gave a little laugh.

i could see in my rear view mirror that he was clearly pissed, he was shouting, pointing and waving around, at this point i could tell he clearly hated me. it wasn't until we stopped before a roundabout that i saw him pull up his handbrake and open the door to come drag me out of the car like niko bellic so i locked my door and starting driving forwards at the first moment i got. i started to panic because this guy looked like one crazy motherfucker and i was sure he'd follow me to work and beat the shit out of me there with whatever tools he had in the van infront of everybody in the office. luckily though i managed to lose him in the traffic and hopefully i never see him again!

    Here is the article: righto, this actually happened last night, heve been writhing around in pain since then, so didn't type until just now.

a pub in perth, western australia has a chilli chicken wing comp on at the moment and, since i like spicy food, my mate challenged me to do it, so i went along. the manager at the pub is talking it up, but i got the idea it was serious chilli when he said the wings came in around 1.5mil scoville heat units. shit. well, i was there, so i might as well have a crack at them.

i only got about half way through the required amount of wings when i bowed out (apparently around 1 in 10 people are finishing the challenge) and was overwhelmed by the usual mouth burn and whatnot. fine, can deal with that. after 15min the mouth burn becomes gut cramps, and these last the rest of the friggin night, on and off 10min at a time.

so around 6.45am i just thought "wonder if there's still any left in my stomach, i bet it won't be that hot by now and if i vomit it out, my body doesn't have to deal w processing it". seems like the logical choice, right? so i pop into the dunny and have a heave, the first of which results in a small amount of puke and some big pieces of chilli (like, thumbnail size, don't know where they were hidden on chicken wings). my second heave only one little pebble of chicken comes out...but...you know how you get splashback from taking a shit? well. i got puke splashback into my right eye. luckily, as predicted, the vomit is not as hot as the chilli when eaten (on vomiting it was actually around the spice level i actually enjoy my food at, so still fairly damn hot) and in addition to the usual shit tickets we also have those moist arse wipe things (one of which was immediately clamped over my eyeball). this. fucking. hurt. straight into the shower w me, handful of body wash straight to the eyelid. it seems i avoided too much getting actually into the eye, but every time i blinked it open for a half second it felt like someone butting out a cigarette on my eyeball. now i'm probably going to get conjunctivitis from having toilet water in my eye, too.

    Here is the summary: puked out chilli, splashback just aboit blinded me and i'll probably get pink-eye.

    Here is the article: sooo this just happened.
been going out with this girl for about 2 years now. we're pretty much living together now, but she occasionally complains that i never take her out on a "date" date (i have no idea what this means). 
now up to this point, whenever i do make plans to take my girl out on a proper all out date, one of us either catches a cold, the weather turns to shit, or some other emergency (act of god/sabotage) occurs. she pouts but doesn't really make too big of a deal about it. 
so this weekend, its sakura blooming season in here tokyo, and i want to make up for the failed dates. i plan a picnic under the sakura trees at a really nice park far from the city. and to prepare, i get my hair cut, take out the blazer from its hiding place, and generally look as dapper as i can be. i went out to buy some nice wine and while walking down the aisle, i see this nose hair waxing kit. now, blame it on the years of being surrounded by hairless japanese guys (im pretty hairy) or my crumbling sense of masculinity in this society, but in my "im da boss" moment i think why the fuck not, and toss that kit along with the wine into the cart with gusto.  
fast forward to this morning. 
the inside of my nose is now hairless like a babies bottom, and my sinuses are either so overjoyed or so confused its turned the inside of my nose it into a frickin water slide of mucous and regret, and on top of that i seem to have now caught a raging cold. at work, (where i am typing this right now) i am blaming the mound of tissues on allergies, but if it doesn't get better by tmrw, i will have to cancel again and inform my ever patient girlfriend that this time its because i fucking stuck wax up my nose.

For example, if you think the summary is 80% likely to get a score of 5, 10% likely to get a score of 4, 5% likely to get a score of 3, 3% likely to get a score of 2, and 1% likely to get a score of 1, you should rate the summary as 80, 10, 5, 3, 2.

    Here is the article: sooo this just happened.
been going out with this girl for about 2 years now. we're pretty much living together now, but she occasionally complains that i never take her out on a "date" date (i have no idea what this means). 
now up to this point, whenever i do make plans to take my girl out on a proper all out date, one of us either catches a cold, the weather turns to shit, or some other emergency (act of god/sabotage) occurs. she pouts but doesn't really make too big of a deal about it. 
so this weekend, its sakura blooming season in here tokyo, and i want to make up for the failed dates. i plan a picnic under the sakura trees at a really nice park far from the city. and to prepare, i get my hair cut, take out the blazer from its hiding place, and generally look as dapper as i can be. i went out to buy some nice wine and while walking down the aisle, i see this nose hair waxing kit. now, blame it on the years of being surrounded by hairless japanese guys (im pretty hairy) or my crumbling sense of masculinity in this society, but in my "im da boss" moment i think why the fuck not, and toss that kit along with the wine into the cart with gusto.  
fast forward to this morning. 
the inside of my nose is now hairless like a babies bottom, and my sinuses are either so overjoyed or so confused its turned the inside of my nose it into a frickin water slide of mucous and regret, and on top of that i seem to have now caught a raging cold. at work, (where i am typing this right now) i am blaming the mound of tissues on allergies, but if it doesn't get better by tmrw, i will have to cancel again and inform my ever patient girlfriend that this time its because i fucking stuck wax up my nose.

    Here is the summary: I went out to buy some nice wine and while walking down the aisle, I saw a nose hair waxing kit.

    Here is the article: be aware: this is a short story that when i wrote turned out huge with all the details, i tried to not make it boring as shit to read and there is a tldr at the end.

---------------

  a little of backstory: i'm a huge loser. i have been in relationships before and i never really liked the girls i've been with, and always failed to achieve anything with the ones i liked. hence i am extra skeptical about liking anyone and very careful about my feelings so i don't fuck myself up again and again.

  so, this week i decided to talk to a girl i have met in kindergarten and never saw again as she went to another school (some years later i left that school and she came back, we have a lot of common friends.) from what i stalked on facebook she looked a lot like a beautiful girl, we liked a lot of things in common and we are both 18. she did looked a bit out of my league but i had nothing to lose and went for it.
  
  we chatted nothing out of the ordinary, she is really gentle and was very cool with me. at some point we started to talk about music and she mentioned loving vinyl discs (i'm a musician), so i asked her kind of joking if there was any chance we could meet and listen to some stuff. and, to my surprise, she confirmed and said i could go to her house anyday in the week, that invitation was a nice surprise, i wasn't flirting with her or anything so it wasn't going to be a date.

  i went out and bought a new album for us to listen (i didn't had any and wanted to impress), got her address (she lives like 3 minutes from my house.) and went there. i did not knew what to expect from all that, she could be anything so i remained skeptical all time.

  i got there, she opened up for me and i was already impressed at how gentle and beautiful she is (more than in pictures). her father was at the door to greet me like i was and old family friend, he showed me the house and took us to a room where he has all his old music equipment, (he worked with it in the 80's) he had a wall full of albums from every band you can imagine. we spent more than 30 minutes talking about music and stuff, we instantly turned into great friends.

  then i spent the whole evening with her listening to the pink floyd albums as we talked lots and lots of stuff, she asked me to tune her guitar and i played her some songs she like, by far i never had such a great time with anyone else. i did not flirt at all as it seemed a bit inappropriate but by that time i did not even care, i could feel we were going to be the biggest mates ever, she was fucking awesome.

  it was getting dark and i said i'd have to leave, but before leaving i mentioned we should hang out next week (as i would be going out of the city the next day. i am out of the city as i'm writing this.). she was okey with it and we agreed to plan it out later. of course she knew it was going to be a date and played along (and that kind of impressed me, as girls tend to reject right away. yes i am pessimist as shit)

  that day we still swapped some messages, i was probably the happiest guy ever. nothing ever turned out that great for me, i didn't fuck up in a single way. (or i think so). 
 
 by that time, i was sold, but i would still keep my pace / act slowly not to scare her. everything was going my way. next day, (already sentimental as fuck) i sent her a simple message before going out. nothing out of the ordinary. for some reason, my ex came talk to me and for the first time i had the balls to send her on her way indefinitely, not important to this story, but it did affect my mood a bit in a negative way.

  that was around 2am, exactly then, the other girl showed up online, but went offline before seeing my message.

okey, no big deal.

  the next day, i sent another message through whatsapp, it was an ordinary message asking her something. that time, she saw, and didn't answer again. that's when i started growing suspicious something is wrong.

  it's been 4 days already, i did not send anything back to her even though i wanted hard to. i have been playing dumb/disinterested since then expecting her to show up. she comes online on whatsapp but not on facebook. (and she was online all the time. also, she is using facebook, so she turned the chat off.)

  i don't want to sound insecure as fuck. but she has never done anything like this before and we had been talking for some weeks. also, there is absolutely no reason or way she could not have done this without the intention of ignoring me. i have spent sometime thinking hard about about reasons she would not be able to respond, but there are none.

 did she hate me? did she just played the cool girl all along? did i fucked up and didn't even noticed? why was she all fucking nice to me to end it this way? i really can't see the girl i was with being this stubborn. if there is one thing i guarantee is that she was nice as hell, she kept interested in our talk and shit, it wasn't boring/dumb for a second.

  now i don't know if i send a message asking what is wrong, if i play dumb and just talk as if nothing happened, if i don't talk at all. so many options. i don't know which one would be worse if it turns out bad.

  what i know is she totally opened up my "bitches ain't shit" protection and wrecked me from the inside, and i had promised myself i would not let that happen since the last time i got fucked by girls. i would not even care if she friendzoned me because i've been real alone and she would be my friend for life, i know this sounds kinda stupid, but that is how it works for me.

  i feel so bad i wan't to forget the great time i had and think it was all a weird dream.

  or, maybe, it's just a massive overreaction by me, i really want it to be but i can't see a way. and i like to be rational in this cases. (i know, right?)

  that is it reddit, i know some people will hate me for writing a story so stupid (i know how much teenage twilight shit this is) but i needed advice/someone to share all that.

also, there is the chance i wrote this all out of anger and everything will turn out fine.

also, english is not my native language and i would like some feedback on my writing. and im sorry for the size of the text, i'm on the cellphone and the screensize doesn't let me have a good idea if it's way too big or just a little.

    Here is the summary: went out with a nice girl, was cool, she started ignoring me hard after.

went to  play paintball for the first time with 6 colleagues, we got strangers mixed into our team. we ended up being about 15 people, meaning half the team unfamiliar faces. second mission was congo village, so capturing the houses in the middle, each team starting at one side. i sprinted to the closest house and stayed a little hidden, with sight onto another house quite a bit further to the middle with people huddling inside. "perfect line of sight", i thought and proceeded to shoot directly at one of them, full hit at least three times. as that person did kind of ignore it i got upset about this apparent cheater and called for the game master to show him out. as you can already imagine, it was at that point i saw the tape of the same colour as mine around his arm while he was walking to the side of the battlefield. i apologized hard in that moment but after that game didn't even know anymore who it was.

    Here is the summary: shot teammate, made him leave at start of game. no respawn.

    Here is the article: this just happened, i'm towards the tail end of warming up now with every blanket in the house on me, cat in the bed, and having eaten hot food (that part was freaky, it felt like heartburn going down). i'm still having some affects so my typing may not make sense in some areas and i'm forgetting how to spell some words. 

i was already exhausted from a long day filled with caffeine, a toddler, and 4 hours sleep the night before, i was crashing from the caffeine right as i started this chore so i thought the whole time that i was just exhausted. the hot water ran out after a short time because it only last like 15 minutes tops in that bathroom but i figured i could get it done quickly enough and the water didn't feel too cold to me, even felt a little warm a few times. i'm crouched in the shower naked the entire time with the drain unplugged so my legs and hands got the brunt of it. i went in at 2am thinking it would be quick and when i was done, i thought i'd only been in there about an hour, it was 7:30am. so roughly 5 hours sprayed continously with cold tap water (it's winter and i have a crawl space, that cold water is really cold). i almost dozed off twice in there and was swaying but again, just thought i was exhausted and hypothermia affects thoughts and reasoning so big surprise, my main concern was just not falling. it really didn't feel that cold shortly, probably because the areas being hit were going knumb without me realizing it. i stumbled around like a drunk person when i came out and thought it was from my numb ass legs but i wasn't shivering so i'm cool right? they'll warm up once i'm in bed. 

climbed in bed exhausted, dick around for about 20 minutes on my phone , legs still mostly numb but now i'm feeling cold. right before sleep i decided to google if i needed to worry about my legs being cold so long. in the end, i'm reading symptoms of hypothermia and seeing i've got all but one, loss of consciousness. checking my temperature, by then it was slightly above 90, cold is getting to me, i'm shivering hard under 4 layers of blankets. i saw shit saying not to sleep so i call a friend to keep me awake until i've warmed up, that when i learned i couldn't talk. i sound worse than drunk, talking slow, slurring, long pauses mid sentence while i remember what i'm saying. i got off the phone when my speech was improving and my pulse had come up, thinking i could probably sleep now, with my blankets same as usual, if only my legs would warm up. 

pretty sure my reasoning still wasn't working well until i realized i should probably pile all my blankets on me, then i made some hot food, then i made the cat lay under here with me (a cat named sundae is warming me up). my legs are still cold as fuck but my core temperature is up around 95 now and my pulse is normal. i'm still out of it but that really could be the exhaustion now. for some reason my chest is killing me, not heart wise but like every muscle, i vaguely remember an ab muscle cramping while i was still cleaning but it didn't occur to me that was odd. 

i'm not entirely sure what i've written here and what i haven't, i'm so tired. my friend is supposed to call in a few hours around when my son should wake to make sure i'm ok, will probably walk him to grandmas so i can sleep some. will update what a dumbass i am when i wake up. i'm super wrapped up so shivering has mostly stopped, my hands and legs are still really cold though.

 

update: am alive. i fell asleep immediately after posting this, slept 7 hours under 5 blankets. i was cleaning foam alphabet floor tiles, there were more than 50, next time i'll just buy new ones. 

oh and i found out why my chest was hurting me and it had nothing to do with this. it's happened once before when i was 17 from a bad coughing fit and i do still have a cough left over from a cold a few weeks ago. plus i'd breathed in freezing air the night before which made it worse. at some point during all of this but not because of it, i had a coughing fit which caused spontaneous pneumothorax. i burst blebs around my lungs and now air is escaping up through my neck and out places like my ears (or at least that's where the guy at the er told me it escapes from last time this happened). now this one really is a huge medical concern because it can cause a collapsed lung so i'm arranging someone to take me to er now. it hurts to take more than a shallow breath. two fuck ups in one night. i probably would have noticed the second one sooner had it not been for the first one.

i have a mysterious bruise at the very top of my forehead, maybe i did go out for a bit and it my head.

    Here is the summary: don't stay in the cold shower thinking you're fine and it hasn't been long. you may end up like my dumb ass with hypothermia after accidentally spending 5 hours in that shit. hypothermia fucks your brain and makes you think you're fine until you're not.

    Here is the article: story time: about 2 weeks ago, i bought a fancy new iphone 6 and so far i loved it. everything was going great with it. i ended up resending a picture of myself to my girlfriend since all my photos were deleted on the phone swap. i promptly deleted the photo after i sent it to her and that was that. 

fast forward a few days: i'm sitting at lunch fiddling with my phone and my friends are chattering it up on the other end of the table and ask if they can see my phone. i didn't think much of it since the 6 is fairly new and they are tech geeks like myself. so i hand them my phone and carry on as usual. at this point about 6 people are staring over my phone in awe. all the sudden i hear a loud gasp and an "oh shit" and then they instantly hand my phone back to me and go into silence. i stare at them with a blank face. 

**there is a deleted folder**

i go red and nobody knows what to say at this point. i put a lock on my phone and nobody talks for the rest of lunch. 

 

edit: there were 2 girls who saw it
*and that was the time my friends saw my dick*

edit 2: thanks to /u/thekrs1 for pointing out it's not an iphone 6 feature... but an ios 8 feature. if you have ios 8, any photo you click delete on will be moved to the "deleted photos" album for 30 days (or you delete the photo from this album).

    Here is the summary: iphone 6 has a deleted photos folder. don't go through it on your friends phone.

    Here is the article: this happened when i was in high school, so approximately 4 years ago.

so i had this attractive girl in my class and i started developing a crush on her. i stated hitting her up on facebook and to my surprise, she replied and  kept a convo going. we then became friends and started to have awkward conversations on facebook.

after a couple of weeks, my interest in her increased and i really felt like i needed her in my life.  so being the dumb 14 year old i was, the first thing that i did was screen shot the entire conversation, including her name and picture, to my usb that i used for my it class and save it into a folder called "future wife".  i would use this usb in my it class to save my work, so i made sure people wouldn't be able to see the folder by putting it inside another folder named "general". 

life seemed good for a couple of weeks and we started chatting more frequently and became closer. i had the courage to ask her out, and she said see was happy to have a secret relationship as she was shy and didn't want her friends knowing. i was extremely happy and agreed.

at this point, the usb became my journal. everything that happened between us i would save it on the usb; if it was in real life, i would save it in a document. 

so here's where the real twist occurs:

after she started sharing her secrets and getting comfortable with me, she asked me something i never expected: my nudes. she said she's never really seen a naked guy before and convinced me that "every couples do it". i hadn't discovered porn at this age, so i took this opportunity to exchange mine for hers. she agreed and we proceeded. 

i then saved her images, to my "journals" as i thought  it was a life accomplishment. 

after some weeks, our it projects were graded out publicly in front of the whole class, and i turned out to get one of the highest for a project some of my friends thought was hard. we weren't aloud to share our projects, but we could show others. now, i denied showing anyone anything on my usb as i feared them seeing my journals. this meant that a lot of my friends were anxious to see my project and some of them started to hate on me, despite my promise of showing it another day. 

i went home that night only to realise that i've lost my usb. i became so anxious and worried that i messaged all my friends that i had lost my usb. this stupid idea caused the ones in my it class to find it and go through the usb. 

they find the nudes and threaten me that they'll share it if i don't send them more nudes of her. at this stage, it was obvious that i'd be sexting. so i denied, and i instead preferred i'll finish all their assignments for the semester. they seemed convinced and gave my usb back at school, and did what i agreed on for the next 4 weeks.

after completing all their assessments for it, i found my journal on the schools public sever named "nudes". everyone who had basic knowledge of computers found them and i ended up ruining her reputation  and soon the rumours spread. being the shy girl, this destroyed her entire self esteem causing her to leave school and never speak to me again.

    Here is the summary: stored my crush's nudes on usb, got stolen and put on the schools server. as a consequence, destroyed my relationship with her and her self esteem.

they find the nudes and threaten me that they'll share it if i don't send them more nudes of her. at this stage, it was obvious that i'd be sexting. so i denied, and i instead preferred i'll finish all their assignments for the semester. they seemed convinced and gave my usb back at school, and did what i agreed on for the next 4 weeks.

after completing all their assessments for it, i found my journal on the schools public sever named "nudes". everyone who had basic knowledge of computers found them and i ended up ruining her reputation  and soon the rumours spread. being the shy girl, this destroyed her entire self esteem causing her to leave school and never speak to me again.

    Here is the summary: I had a crush on a girl in high school and started hitting her up on facebook.

    You will be given one summary written for a news article. Your task is to rate the summary based on the following criteria:
    Output format: PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE

    Evaluation Criteria:
    1. Read the news article carefully and identify the main topic and key points.
    2. Read the summary and compare it to the news article. Check if the summary covers the main topic and key points of the news article, and if it resents them in a clear and logical order.
    3. Rate the summary with 5 percentages, where each one represents how likely the summary is going to get a score from 1 to 5. For example, if you think the summary is 80% likely to get a score of 5, 10% likely to get a score of 4, 5% likely to get a score of 3, 3% likely to get a score of 2, and 1% likely to get a score of 1, you should rate the summary as 80, 10, 5, 3, 2.

    Here is the article: this happened when i was in high school, so approximately 4 years ago.

so i had this attractive girl in my class and i started developing a crush on her. i stated hitting her up on facebook and to my surprise, she replied and  kept a convo going. we then became friends and started to have awkward conversations on facebook.

after a couple of weeks, my interest in her increased and i really felt like i needed her in my life.  so being the dumb 14 year old i was, the first thing that i did was screen shot the entire conversation, including her name and picture, to my usb that i used for my it class and save it into a folder called "future wife".  i would use this usb in my it class to save my work, so i made sure people wouldn't be able to see the folder by putting it inside another folder named "general". 

life seemed good for a couple of weeks and we started chatting more frequently and became closer. i had the courage to ask her out, and she said see was happy to have a secret relationship as she was shy and didn't want her friends knowing. i was extremely happy and agreed.

at this point, the usb became my journal. everything that happened between us i would save it on the usb; if it was in real life, i would save it in a document. 

so here's where the real twist occurs:

after she started sharing her secrets and getting comfortable with me, she asked me something i never expected: my nudes. she said she's never really seen a naked guy before and convinced me that "every couples do it". i hadn't discovered porn at this age, so i took this opportunity to exchange mine for hers. she agreed and we proceeded. 

i then saved her images, to my "journals" as i thought  it was a life accomplishment. 

after some weeks, our it projects were graded out publicly in front of the whole class, and i turned out to get one of the highest for a project some of my friends thought was hard. we weren't aloud to share our projects, but we could show others. now, i denied showing anyone anything on my usb as i feared them seeing my journals. this meant that a lot of my friends were anxious to see my project and some of them started to hate on me, despite my promise of showing it another day. 

i went home that night only to realise that i've lost my usb. i became so anxious and worried that i messaged all my friends that i had lost my usb. this stupid idea caused the ones in my it class to find it and go through the usb.

    Here is the article: so, this happened like 5 years ago.

i was in the 8th grade and i was really bad at maths at the time, so my mother and father decided to take me to a math tutor who they knew pretty well at the time.

anyways, in that private class, we were like 6-7 of us who practiced the same thing, and well, you know what comes next, my bowels started to explode with a blast of diarrhea just waiting to come out every second.
i ask the teacher politely to use the bathroom, he told me to go and told me where the bathroom is.

i get into the bathroom, do my job, but shit is about to get real(yea, you see what i did there :]).
you know that feeling when you go to do your job, but you never check for toilet paper before you do the job?
well, that's what happened..
i panicked like fuck, i checked the whole bathroom for a toilet-paper roll, but there was none.
so what do i do now?
all my math books and gear are there, and i still have like an hour to go before the class finishes, so i go there and pretend like nothing happened, but my ass didn't think so.it itched like hell and you could feel it smearing every second more and more..

anyways, the class finished and i walked to home(which is like 10 minutes by foot away)with my legs spread like a teenage girl that's about to lose her virginity on a prom.

the feeling of ease when you step foot on your home porch is the best feeling in the world.

    Here is the summary: i took a crap in my math tutor's house and he didn't have any toilet paper.

    Here is the article: as per usual, this fuck up did not happen today, but roughly 10 years ago when i was in college.  this is a throwaway because it's potentially identifying, and also because it's embarrassing as hell.

so, after a really hard breakup i did what many girls do and decided to totally overhaul my look.  i went to the salon and got my previously light brown/blonde highlighted hair dyed black.  i rocked this look for a few months during my summer off of school, but by the time i got back to school i decided i was tired of it and wanted another change. this is where the fuck up begins.  

late one night, i got the urge to do something about my hair.  instead of being sane and waiting until the morning to book an appointment with a professional, i headed to the 24 hour cvs and bought myself a bleaching kit. anyone who has tried to go from dark hair to light on their own in one step can probably imagine what happened next - my hair turned orange.  like, pumpkin orange.  i freaked out, and in what turned out to be only my second mistake of many that evening, i ran to the store and bought another bleaching kit. this had no appreciable effect.  by this point, i am desperate.  i have orange hair and the bleaching kits are not working.  

now, let's keep in mind that one of the primary ingredients in hair bleaching kits is ammonium chloride.  so that is currently sitting on my hair, although i didn't know it because i hadn't read the ingredients beforehand.  as i'm sitting in the bathroom with the second box of hair bleach on my head, an idea comes to me.  clorox!  clorox is bleach, and bleach will save the day!  so i go grab my bottle of chlorox and literally dump it over my head in the tub, culminating my monumental fuck up.

for the non-chemists, mixing ammonium chloride and bleach will produce a series of chemical reactions, ultimately creating copious amounts of deadly chlorine gas.  within seconds of pouring the bleach, white gas started billowing up from the tub.  i was extremely lucky that the bathroom was right near the front door, and that i had the presence of mind to gtfo of there.  it took several hours to ventilate the apartment.  in addition to almost dying, i actually did kill my hair, which became straw-like, fell out in clumps, and took almost 3 years to completely grow out and recover.

diy hair bleaching - not even once.

    Here is the summary: tried to bleach my hair but made poison gas instead.

    Here is the article: this happened about a month ago. i am a competitive swimmer. my team was at a meet in boston. it was a championship meet so it was a pretty big deal and people had been training for this specific meet for a while and were very focused on getting cut times to qualify for nationals and other meets, one being olympic trials this summer. 

the way this pool was set up, is a lower deck where the pool is and a raised balcony encircling the pool with spectator seating. although i was on the pool deck getting ready for my race, i had a while before it started and i had some water bottles in my bag which i left with a friend up in the balcony. i ran up to get the water bottles for me and my teammate. 

me, being my lazy self, decided; how about instead of carrying these down i just throw it down to my friend. good idea right? hell no!

this was during the final race of the 500 freestyle, for anyone who doesn't know it is 20 lengths of the pool and a semi difficult race. during a 500 or any distance swimming event. there is someone who stands at the end of the lane and sticks a sign in the water that tells the swimmer which lap they are on that way they don't forget. this person is called a counter.  

when i threw the water bottle, it slipped out of my hand and hit the counter right in the back of the head while they were crouching over the water. this caused them to fall into the water on top of the swimmer who was just about to finish her race! the swimmer was then disqualified all because of me! this girl was in first place at the time and would have had a junior nationals qualifying time!! i have never felt so bad in my life. 

 

edit: luckily no one really saw it so no one knew that it was me because they were too busy watching the race

    Here is the summary: ; threw a water bottle to a friend from the balcony, hit the 500 counter in the back of the head, knocked her into the water during the final leg of the race and ruined a young swimmers hopes and dreams

    Here is the article: so i saw something similar to this about somebody "cursing" a child and it made me think of this moment from my life. so, in 8th grade, i hated my science teacher and her annoying 9yo son. she was one of those people who always thought she was right and she had a "my child is perfect" mindset. i can handle arrogance and stuff, but the always talking about her "perfect child" got on my nerves. she'd even bring the little monster to the school with her on his sick days.  well, one day she gets a call from the hubby during class. she asks us to hang on and that the conversation was about her wonderful son and his day with his dad. so, she steps out and i turn to my friend laugh and say, " jeez that gets on my nerves. he isn't perfect. it'd be funny if something bad happened to him." i laughed and my friends just kinda stared at me, then laughed. a few seconds later, the teacher comes back, and with a distressed look on her face, tells us her son fell off his bike, passed out and had a broken leg. i sat there and my stomach dropped. she rushed out and my friends turned to me. the only thing that came to my mind was, "well, shit. i'm  psychic."

    Here is the summary: wished the worst on my teacher's son and he ended up breaking his leg and getting a head injury.

    Here is the article: well, this happened about 4 years ago. so, 4yaifu.

its halloween night and im at a party with my then gf, and a bunch of friends. we are playing beer pong and other drinking games. generally having a good time. i start to get a pain in my back, under my shoulder blades, i attribute it to pulling a muscle or something like that, and continue on. it starts to get worse. im thinking i just pulled it seriously. my gf at the time offers me a muscle relaxer, and it works. we finish partying and head to my place. being as intoxicated as we were, we went to bed. few hours later i wake up to the worst pain i have ever felt in my life. same spot, only its making it hard to breath, it was a strong struggle to breath and it was very labored. i couldnt even walk. all i could do was stay in the fetal position. my roommate carries me to the car and my gf takes me to the hospital. i get seen pretty quickly as i'm complaining about chest pain. now, i have a lot of tattoos, and a piercing. i think the doctor took one look at me and thought i was drug seeking. he made me pee in a cup which came clean. they took an xray and found nothing. they diagnosed me with inflamed lining of my chest cavity. gave me a script for anti-inflammatory and sent me home. 


the script worked. i was relatively pain free. able to sleep so i did. again, a few hours later i wake up in the same pain. terrible pain. i have ripped the tendon off my knee cap before, twice, and i would rather feel that again, than this pain i was having in my chest. again, im carried to the car, only this time we go to a different hospital. im seen quickly as again im having chest pain. they give me three percs, and iv me with demerol and toridol(spelling?) im high as balls at this point. they xray, find nothing. they take into account all the symptoms im complaining about and say "it sounds like you have a blood clot, but you are pretty young"(i was 25 at the time). they give me a blood test (ddimmer test i believe its called) and it doesnt come out good. they cat scan me and the doctor comes in after reviewing it and breaks the news. i had a pulmonary embolism that resulted in a pulmonary infarct. a blood clot that had killed part of my lung. 

i had to be on blood thinners for 6 months. regularly getting my joints looked at because they kept swelling up and causing pain and they were afraid i was bleeding into my joints. couldnt work, was always cold even inside. 

i talked to a lawer about the situation and how i thought the first doctor was wrong in his decision to send me home. he agreed. now, i thought that i had time to initiate a lawsuit over this. but, apparently the statute of limitations in my state is a year. i tried to initiate a little after a year. after my recovery, and getting back to my job trying to get everything in order. first doctor sent me home with a blood clot that could have killed me and i couldnt do anything about it.

    Here is the article: so i was messing around in study hall after school with photoshop, and i found all the yearbook photos. i thought it would be funny if i messed around with them (not saving of course), but i somehow clicked a button and deleted it when i meant to go back to the file before it. i started panicking and laughing, but i knew it was serious. i texted my friend, and it turned out somehow he had every photo saved on his computer, so i got lucky. i have no clue how i will get those onto the network at school though. the worst part is that graphic arts is trying to work on the yearbook photo, and i am not even in that class, so it makes the situation even weirder. i told a few people and they were shocked, and who would blame them, i deleted every individual yearbook photo from the network.

edit: today i succesfully downloaded and put in the backup without my teacher noticing! i needed to finish some hw before my next classand my teacher let me (i have temporary graphic arts so this was the teacher i was trying to keep the secret from), and right after i logged my email in and downloaded the drive folder and put it in the right place. i was so lucky.

    Here is the article: so i normally don’t have much in the way of major fuck ups but today was a doozy. excuse the format as i’m on mobile. 

anyways today was like any other sunday except my wife went off to a baby shower with our infant leaving me with our two year old.

when we got up from our respective naps, we came downstairs to watch some tv and get her a snack. while getting her a snack she complained to me about a hangnail on her right thumb. thinking i could do it quickly and painlessly, i got out the cuticle clippers and clipped it away. what i didn’t realize is that i clipped it too low.  also i didn’t realize that thumbs bleed like crazy. 

cue my daughter screaming her head off as her thumb starts dripping blood. eventually i got it to stop bleeding after 20 minutes of her screaming/crying from both pain and seeing the blood. 

i think i’m more traumatized by the experience than she is considering i’m still freaking out about it while she’s watching tv. 

i’m sure i’m going to catch a ton of crap from my wife for this.

    Here is the summary: cut a hangnail too short on daughters hand, watched her bleed a lot and scream/cry her head off for 20 minutes. won’t ever do that again.

i think i’m more traumatized by the experience than she is considering i’m still freaking out about it while she’s watching tv. 

i’m sure i’m going to catch a ton of crap from my wife for this.

    Here is the summary: I normally don’t have much in the way of major fuck ups but today was a doozy.

    You will be given one summary written for a news article. Your task is to rate the summary based on the following criteria:
    Output format: PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE

    Evaluation Criteria:
    1. Read the news article carefully and identify the main topic and key points.
    2. Read the summary and compare it to the news article. Check if the summary covers the main topic and key points of the news article, and if it resents them in a clear and logical order.
    3. Rate the summary with 5 percentages, where each one represents how likely the summary is going to get a score from 1 to 5. For example, if you think the summary is 80% likely to get a score of 5, 10% likely to get a score of 4, 5% likely to get a score of 3, 3% likely to get a score of 2, and 1% likely to get a score of 1, you should rate the summary as 80, 10, 5, 3, 2.

    Here is the article: today was nasty, snowing like crazy on top of a layer of ice, so conditions on the road & sidewalks was terrible, particularly this morning. i was exiting a professional building and noticed an elderly woman walking through the parking area towards the door, and being the chivalrous gentleman i usually am, help the door for her, even though she wasn't quite there yet (and thinking about yesterday's post about polite things people do that can end up being awkward). 

when she noticed that i was holding the door for her, she began to quicken her pace, as people are wont to do, but considering the conditions, this was the worst choice she could have made. in less than a second she slipped on the snow/ice and did a face plant with her head hitting the sidewalk and her body still in the parking area. she was no waif, which i'm sure exacerbated the problem.

she immediately began to cry and i felt terrible, and immediately rushed over to make sure she was ok and to help her up. it took a bit as she was scared out of her mind, and i held her as we walked to the door, and i profusely apologized for nothing really, even though i was actually doing a good deed that messed up.

after a few minutes she began to recover her wits, determined she was not hurt and we talked about the awful weather and she snifflingly said "i wouldn't even have come out in this weather but i need to have my blood work done this morning." "i'm so scared, just so scared!"

i offered to help her to the office inside the building but the waved me off and said she was fine, but thank you. i still felt like an ass. i still do and it's 10 hours later.

    Here is the summary: opened a door for an elderly woman entering her doctor's building causing her to burger hard face first into the snow and ice, totally freaking her out and making her cry. felt bad for trying to be nice.**

    Here is the article: i'm not good with women.  i've been dealing with some shit for the last few years and basically did nothing but work, sleep, and eat, so i'm out of practice when it comes to being social in any way.  but i went to the club with my roommate for her birthday.  i've been doing better so i figured why not go out and try to have some fun.  i smoked a couple spliffs, had a few g n ts, and was rocking out on the dance floor, just having a good time.  this ridiculously cute woman comes up to me and starts dancing.  she's telling me what a good dancer i am, taking selfies with me, and asking what my plans for the night are.

meanwhile, i fucking panicked.  this sort of thing hasn't happened to me in five years.  my first thought is that my roommate and her friend were setting me up.  i kept looking around for them while awkwardly trying to figure out how to dance with this girl.  then i wonder if she's just rolling or something.  i mean, me, a good dancer?  so i keep stumbling and slurring my way through trying to talk to her while trying to decide why she approached me.  i felt like a deer in the headlights.  

i finally see my roommate and go to ask her who this woman is, since i was still assuming my roommate had something to do with it.  turns out neither my roommate nor her friend had anything to do with it, but while i was talking to my roommate the woman i danced with comes up, says, "oh, so you have a girlfriend.  ugh, have a nice night."  it took me a couple seconds to process this and by the time it sunk in that i had fucked up i couldn't find her again.  

so, the first time a woman has shown me attention in years, and i blow it because i couldn't understand why anyone would be interested in me.  i could've ended my dry spell with and incredible woman, but instead i panicked and thought someone was playing a joke on me.  i guess i went full middle school on her, but hey, at least i know i'm somewhat attractive now.  sorry this tifu didn't involve pooping, sex, or injury, but i'm definitely feeling stupid this morning.

    Here is the summary: beautiful woman dances with me, i panic and blow her off.

    Here is the article: throwaway cause numerous friends know my username.

so, i went to my girlfriends house at lunch to eat.  after eating it turned into a lunch quickie.  well, it ended up going a little too long and i was gonna be late getting back to work.  so, being in a hurry, i left the condom on and threw on my clothes.  i figured, hey, i'll just throw it away in the bathroom at work and bury it in the trash so no one sees it.  well i get back to work and get inside to clock in.  after clocking in and about to head to the bathroom, one of the guys from the shop runs in the office and tells everyone, "dude, there is a used condom on the floor, come look!"  my heart just about stopped.  i ran out there to the guys in the shop looking at it on the floor and i said: "shit, i think it fell out of my pants on the way back from lunch."  so, while walking back into work, it had slid down my legs, and fell out the bottom of my pants leg onto the shop floor with all fluid intact.  luckily just the guys in the shop saw it and none of the managers.  i grabbed it really quick, went in the bathroom and buried it in the trash can, and washed my hands.  i probably won't hear the end of this for a while.

    You will be given one summary written for a news article. Your task is to rate the summary based on the following criteria:
    Output format: PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE

    Evaluation Criteria:
    1. Read the news article carefully and identify the main topic and key points.
    2. Read the summary and compare it to the news article. Check if the summary covers the main topic and key points of the news article, and if it resents them in a clear and logical order.
    3. Rate the summary with 5 percentages, where each one represents how likely the summary is going to get a score from 1 to 5. For example, if you think the summary is 80% likely to get a score of 5, 10% likely to get a score of 4, 5% likely to get a score of 3, 3% likely to get a score of 2, and 1% likely to get a score of 1, you should rate the summary as 80, 10, 5, 3, 2.

    Here is the article: i am going to make a very quick background seeing as though i did this once but my internet crashed.

i have cerebral palsy, this means i leave 5 minutes early form classes so i don't get hurt. i used to have a good student-teacher relation with my teacher. but after a homework incident, i blamed on her because i left 5 mins early i didn't know about it. she has never been the same way. anyway i am a asshole because i am smart, not the genius smart but i can read shit and instantly understand it such as "quantum physics". 
anyway i say shit, people don't believe me i am right they get proved wrong this people think i am a smart ass dickface. plus i also correct people who are not scientifically accurate. anyway i messed up on this physics test because i was away in another room for most of the lessons because of uniform (btw something to do with the cerebral palsy) i usually get a*-a maybe b. (i got a c)
because i did bad my teacher found this as a weak point and exploited that. she made me feel bad saying how she thinks i don't put effort in or that she doesn't see it anyway. she asked if i was being put down by other and if i should be in the class any more. then she goes on to say i don't think you can do a-level physics <------ i need this for my job... so i say i will do better even though i have so much work in my book it will make your head explode. plus this was right before a physics isa (kick a person even more so i feel hopeless now)


let's skip to a week ago we did a physics mock and i had already done a part of the paper (this mock was to old booklets in one.) so i did not finish but i was so sure! i had done well it did not matter... now let's skip to today i found out that i got another c my teacher went through it with me and said some of the things i didn't show it clearly enough even though i got the right answer! so i didn't get no marks and i also did a few equations the wrong way. 

(i will admit i was being reckless thinking i had done it right) . my finally score was 18 i need 24 for a b. so now everyone laughs at me because i am meant to be smart. but "that i will do better thing to miss has finally give her a reason to think i am not good enough for a-level physics and she brought it up again to me. i was more focused on doing well to make her happy then i fucked up and did the paper wrong/most of it wrong. :(... i have talked about miss in meetings to make sure she knows about my disability but she still seems to hold leaving 5 minutes early against me. she says that i want to leave just so i can get home early (that is one reason, but i need to leave early for safety) anyway because i fucked up on this test i probably won't get into a-level and i won't go and get the degree i want. 

all because i said i would do better then fucked up on the test by being more worried about how well i do rather than actually spending more time making sure i did shit right because i may have lost all hope for my future in physics. (like i said i had already done parts of the test and done them right but i still messed up) so for advice 

"instead of worrying what your going to get, make sure you get worry about getting it right even if it's just one question." -myself 

"don't purposely try to make people happy and do good to fix a relationship, because really you are not really thinking about your future but your and theirs. think about yours!" -myself

    Here is the summary: have disability, fucked up previously teacher holds leaving early against me and the fact i fucked up. i fucked up again and now i have lost all hope in the future career i want.

    Here is the article: i go to the university, and i am going to get a physiotherapy degree next year.  
in my university, there are only twenty students for this degree course, so we are quite close between students. we also have a whatsapp group for the class, in which we speak about lessons, assignments and whatever the teachers told us. before the exams, we often ask one another things we are not sure about.  
boys also have another group, much less serious than the one with everyone, were we discuss about girls, going out on saturdays, and things like this, just like friends. in this male group sometimes we send nude pics, or maybe pics of some female friend at the disco.  
the two groups have very similar names, one is physiotherapy and the other one is physiotherartists.  
today, my classmates went to the sea, and i didn't because i live quite distant from there, and i had to obtain a certification at a public office. when i went back home, i slept for a while, turning off my phone, and when i woke up, i got about 50 new whatsapp messages from the two groups. still a bit asleep, i opened the notifications, and i saw a pic of my friends at the beach divided in 2 rows, with 4 girls in the first row. without thinking twice, or controlling the group's name, i typed "goddamn, look at those tits" and i sent it.
a male friend replied with a laughing smile, and others followed. they all were males, so i typed "what a pity not to be there". now the first girl replied, saying "what a pervert". i suddenly realised i was in the main group, and i tried to apologize, but another girl said i was creepy.  
at that point, i replied at least it was an honest compliment, and i shut down the phone. now, i tried to drown myself in the shower, and i can't imagine next year lessons. the male classmates already took screenshots, in order to never let me forget this.
the only thing i and the others didn't imagine is that one of the girls (not one of the two i was staring at when i wrote) just wrote me to ask if i want to examine those tits closer, so maybe it doesn't sucks so much to fu things.

    Here is the summary: i sent a message to the wrong whatsapp group, and i am now considered a pervert by my own class.

    Here is the article: so this little story actually happened during the summer of 2004, but reddit wasn’t even founded yet so i hope you’ll excuse me.

i had just finished 3rd grade, and like any nine-year-old, i was in awe of the vast summer that lay before me.  lazily lounging around in the summer heat, chasing down ice cream trucks, and splashing around in the neighborhood pool were only a fraction of the fun to be had in these months of pure, unadulterated freedom.  among those to share in this awesomeness were my friends who lived on the same street as me.  we were all more or less the same age, and had been friends for a few years after having moved into our relatively-new neighborhood one by one.  water gun fights, street-spanning games of hide-and-seek, and quiet summer nights watching fireworks (we lived right next to an amusement park) were all part of our repertoire of summers past, and this summer was to be no different.

one day, however, we decided we needed something new, something to make this summer the best one yet.  what better way to do this than to form a kids-only club, and be the envy of all kids in the neighborhood?  we’d have a secret base, hold secret meetings, and take part in nefarious, yet harmless, childish hijinks (i think i’d been watching too much kids next door on cartoon network at the time).  with all this secrecy and exclusivity, we’d be the talk of all kids in town—exactly what we wanted.

we set to work immediately.  we established a hierarchy for members (i was vice president btw).  we held initiation rituals.  we formed club rules.  hell, we even decided punishments, like writing 1000 word essays if you were to, say, borrow a friend’s video game for longer than the agreed-upon time.  within a few days, we had a fully-functioning club.  it was practically a cult, to be completely honest.

but we needed a name.  so, in all of our collective nine-year-old wisdom, we came up with the best possible name we could’ve thought of: the “cool kids club”.  but *nooooo*, that was too simple, someone said.  we needed to be *cool*.  to be ***edgy***.  and so we had the bright idea to change the spelling of our club name.  “c”s would become “k”s, and our new name became the “*kool kids klub*” (i think you can see where this is going).  we then stood back and admired our creative genius.  we.  were.  *awesome*.

but there was one more thing remaining: we needed members.  and so it was decided to create flyers and distribute them by hand in all of the mailboxes of those we knew to have kids in the neighborhood, advertising them to join what we thought to be the coolest, most awesomest kids-only club in town.  thus, within a span of a day, we had slipped hand-made flyers in the mailbox of every kid in the neighborhood.  it read something like this, complete with the crude handwriting that only a nine-year-old could manage, drawn with crayola markers on hastily-cut pieces of notebook paper:

“wanna have fun? join the coolest club for kids in town.  **join the kkk**”

needless to say, my folks got a lot of confusing phone calls (and strange looks) from concerned parents in the neighborhood.

    Here is the summary: created a club with my friends during one summer, invited all kids to join via flyers in their mailboxes, now the whole neighborhood thinks my family are white supremacists.

    Here is the article: so this little story actually happened during the summer of 2004, but reddit wasn’t even founded yet so i hope you’ll excuse me.

i had just finished 3rd grade, and like any nine-year-old, i was in awe of the vast summer that lay before me.  lazily lounging around in the summer heat, chasing down ice cream trucks, and splashing around in the neighborhood pool were only a fraction of the fun to be had in these months of pure, unadulterated freedom.  among those to share in this awesomeness were my friends who lived on the same street as me.  we were all more or less the same age, and had been friends for a few years after having moved into our relatively-new neighborhood one by one.  water gun fights, street-spanning games of hide-and-seek, and quiet summer nights watching fireworks (we lived right next to an amusement park) were all part of our repertoire of summers past, and this summer was to be no different.

one day, however, we decided we needed something new, something to make this summer the best one yet.  what better way to do this than to form a kids-only club, and be the envy of all kids in the neighborhood?  we’d have a secret base, hold secret meetings, and take part in nefarious, yet harmless, childish hijinks (i think i’d been watching too much kids next door on cartoon network at the time).  with all this secrecy and exclusivity, we’d be the talk of all kids in town—exactly what we wanted.

we set to work immediately.  we established a hierarchy for members (i was vice president btw).  we held initiation rituals.  we formed club rules.  hell, we even decided punishments, like writing 1000 word essays if you were to, say, borrow a friend’s video game for longer than the agreed-upon time.  within a few days, we had a fully-functioning club.  it was practically a cult, to be completely honest.

but we needed a name.  so, in all of our collective nine-year-old wisdom, we came up with the best possible name we could’ve thought of: the “cool kids club”.  but *nooooo*, that was too simple, someone said.  we needed to be *cool*.  to be ***edgy***.  and so we had the bright idea to change the spelling of our club name.  “c”s would become “k”s, and our new name became the “*kool kids klub*” (i think you can see where this is going).  we then stood back and admired our creative genius.  we.  were.  *awesome*.

but there was one more thing remaining: we needed members.  and so it was decided to create flyers and distribute them by hand in all of the mailboxes of those we knew to have kids in the neighborhood, advertising them to join what we thought to be the coolest, most awesomest kids-only club in town.  thus, within a span of a day, we had slipped hand-made flyers in the mailbox of every kid in the neighborhood.  it read something like this, complete with the crude handwriting that only a nine-year-old could manage, drawn with crayola markers on hastily-cut pieces of notebook paper:

“wanna have fun? join the coolest club for kids in town.  **join the kkk**”

needless to say, my folks got a lot of confusing phone calls (and strange looks) from concerned parents in the neighborhood.

    Here is the summary: We formed a kids-only club, the "kool kids klub", and distributed flyers advertising it to all kids in the neighborhood.

    Here is the article: so this happened two hours ago, now currently sitting in a&e. 

i got back from canada yesterday, i live in london so my body clock is running 8 hours behind. last night i slept for two hours and had never felt more rough this morning. i had a big showjumping competition this afternoon and had prepared the night before. seeing as i had put lots of effort into getting ready, i thought i may as well go ahead with the plan (fuck up number one). 

i haven't ridden my horse for about 3 weeks, so she was very skitty and excitable. she was trotting on the spot like mad and throwing her head about - she was obviously happy to be out. i warmed her up and she jumped the practice fence nicely. the course was 80cm in height. 

i started the course and she was doing great, adrenaline kicks in and i'm no longer tired. however on the second to last jump i lose my stirrup, and can't get my foot back in. if i refuse the last jump i won't go through to the next round and lose out on any possibility of winning. i think to myself "fuck it" and kick her on - one foot dangling (fuck up number two). 

of course, you guessed it, i lose balance and fall. right onto my shoulder. i get up, have a little cry due to shock and decide not to advance into the next rounds as i realise i'm on the verge of passing out due to exhaustion. 

i walk my horse back to her stable and notice she has cut her ankle deeply, probably knocking it on a pole. turns out she'll be out of action for another three weeks as it started to swell pretty badly. 

as i'm driving home i notice my left shoulder and neck muscles are severely hurting. i cannot move my head without pain searing down my left arm and back. i decide to drive to the hospital which is where i am now. waiting time is currently 3 hours. 

yay.

    Here is the summary: decided to compete my horse on two hours sleep, lost stirrup going into last jump, fell and might have ripped a muscle.

    Here is the article: this actually happened today, this morning i had to go to a hotel for a meeting at 745ish am, my apple maps led me the best way and even though i left my house at 615, when i finally made it the time was 730ish.

i turn into the hotel just like maps says and i follow the winding road, and there's cars behind me pulling in, and i finally get to what i think is valet i'm waiting my turn, i am behind a very badass hummer and in front of a super nice mercedes suv, i'm in a scion so i can't see ahead because the hummer is big. i'm daydreaming about how awesome the free breakfast will be at the hotel, and after about 20 minutes im finally where the valet people take your cars, a lady walks up to my passenger door and opens it, looks in the backseat, and closes the door and just stares at me. i'm sooo embarrassed i quickly realized my car is the crappiest car around (even though it's 3 months old), and this lady is not going to valet my car.  she then says "did someone take your child?" and i'm super confused. i say is this the valet and she says no this is the drop off line, i ask is this the hotel? and she says no it's a school - the hotel is next door. my map led me to the wrong entrance. we both kind of laughed so it wasn't too bad but i was almost for my meeting. in my defense the bricks and everywhere were full of ivy and i hate mornings .

    Here is the summary: i waited 20 minutes in a ritzy private school drop off line thinking the teachers were valet drivers of a fancy hotel.

    Here is the article: so, i have a honeybucket, what this is, is a bucket where you use the bathroom in. it started to smell, so i decided "ill cut that smell with bleach, rubbing alcohol and hydrogen peroxide!"

well wasn't i an idiot; urine contains ammonia. 

also, bleach + rubbing alcohol make chloroform.

so thankfully i sealed the bucket enough that no mustard gas or chloroform will kill me. but now i have to take the bucket to hazmat to deal with mustard gas and chloroform. only problem? nearest hazmat station is 65 miles away from me. so yay! on top of that, i don't have a veichle other than a bike, so 300$ service charge? yes please!

 

update; borough hazmat stations will not take the bucket. this means 300 mile trip with a guy i can throw 200$ on to dump this shit off.

edit: if you guys are seriously wondering how i have internet, i'm doing this off my phone on lte.

edit 2: i also dont live in the bush, you can access the sewers where i'm at, just my building isn't hooked up. idc if you know what city i live in; homer, alaska.

    Here is the article: so this happened last night, but i was way too tired to post it in tifu. little back story got a new wifi card for my pc, my pc does not have a cd drive so was using my old laptop to download the software, transfer it to a usb stick and take the files off that for the drivers to my pc.... on to the fuck up.

after everything is happily finished downloading, i'm thinking i should really start treating my hardware with more respect, so i right click the little usb icon and click "safely eject usb flash drive" everything seems fine, get the little notification everything is good. turn on my pc, plug in the usb and than get usb error 43, "device not recognized due to malfunction of device" aka to all you untechsavy people its fried. thanks a lot microsoft!

 

edit: forgot to add that in the end i did get the drivers installed just by using my laptop to transmit the wifi and hardwired it to my pc than just download the drivers online. have no idea why i didn't bother to do that in the first place.

    Here is the summary: I got a new wifi card for my pc.

    Here is the article: i descided to treat myself a snack on my way home from work, so i went to the drive-through and got a sweet chilli chicken wrap meal with a coke. the next thing i do is park in the area and descide to eat my fries since im starving. 
while im eating i place my coke on top of the car radio in the middle of the front section of the car(forgive me for not remembering the correct terms here). everything is great and i finish the fries and move on to my chicken wrap. now i tell myself i can eat this while im driving so i start the car and drive on while enjoying the great sweet chilli taste...
disaster strikes at the first right-turn i take, since i forgot i placed my coke ontop of the radio, it falls down to the left and lands directly in my junk and icecubes and coke is everywhere. meenwhile i apparently get a bit of a chock and squeezed the wrap i had in one of my hands so the bottom of the wrap bursts open and all of the  contents just splashes down my chest creating a good mix with the coke in my lap.

i realised i just lost at life and just give up, driving on to the nearest parking space and pray that they had given me 100 napkins in the meal-bag. they hadn't .. and i was still hungy.

    Here is the article: actually this was 7 years ago when me and my best friend were in 9th grade (both of us 14). so here's the story: he wanted to quit playing because he was badly addicted to the game (i was too but the game was my life at the time and quitting was way out of the question for me). so he gives me his account and tells me to change the password and never tell him the new password. 
now of course the genius 14-year-old-me thought, "hey, what better way to help my buddy quit than to get his account permanently banned?". so i login and start doing stupid things like cursing at every person i saw and doing a bunch of random shit that was clearly against the rules of the game, eventually the account was banned. however, runescape has a system where if your account is banned, then they give you a chance to appeal yourself and explain why you should be unbanned. this is when an ingenious idea popped into my head (or atleast i thought it was ingenious at the time) and this is exactly what i wrote in my appeal: "i'm going to kill myself if you don't unban me." now, i kid you not, the very next morning, around 5am, cops were at his house asking him all kinds of questions about if he's suicidal and searched his entire room for all possible weapons. so because the original ip-address on the account was his, somehow the makers of runescape were able to get a hold of the local police, send them over to my friends house at 5am, and search his entire room and questioned him about whether he was thinking about suicide over being banned over the game. the next morning, as you can imagine, him and his parents were super pissed at me. 
but, in the end, i was able to get him to quit, so mission accomplished. 
oh, and of course they never unbanned his account.

    Here is the summary: friend gave me his runescape account because he was quitting, i got it banned and tried to appeal is saying "i'm going to kill myself if you don't unban me." cops showed up at his house at 5am thinking he was suicidal and searched his entire room for possible weapons

    Here is the article: i graduated from my university late last year. i received my degree itself (the piece of paper that said **"1st class honours in [your degree]"**) a few months after that. all good so far. 

a couple months after that, they released the transcripts (the results, basically). i don't know why they chose to release our transcripts after our degrees - don't ask me why. 

here's where things go screwy. i realized at once that i didn't appear to qualify for my first class honours degree. i had a cgpa that was lower than the 3.7 required for a first class honours. but it could be rounded up to 3.7, so i initially assume that that was the case. heck, on the transcript itself was printed the neat little words "first class honours".

until i realized later that something was up. what i thought was my cgpa was actually my *gpa* for the year. **my actual cgpa was 3.58** - it's printed on the paper itself, and i just did the math and it checks out. which is nowhere near 3.7. **i should be a 2nd class honours** degree holder. 

now, i have no issue with this myself. hey, first class, second class, no biggie. the problem is, i just submitted my resume for a big shot company awhile ago. and on that resume, i clearly state that i have a 1st class honours. 

well, the company promptly replied and told me to back it up by submitting my transcript. sure, i thought. no biggie. i can submit that. then it hit me. my transcript. my transcript literally contradicts itself. on the same piece of paper that says i have a first class honours degree and a cgpa of 3.58 is the classification guide that says that the requirement for first class honours is 3.7 and above.

now, i haven't exactly told a lie. my university really *did* give me a first class honours degree. it says so on my transcript, says so on my degree, and it says so on my online student account. the math just doesn't agree with it, since i'm below the required cgpa. and i never bothered to correct my university. so now it's gonna look like i'm either taking advantage of my university's mistake by being willfully ignorant (and hey, i guess i can't deny that) or that i straight up made a very stupid forgery.

    Here is the summary: university gave me a degree qualification that was higher than i deserved. applied for a job, potential employer now wants transcript, transcript completely contradicts itself by giving me a 1st class honours while simultaneously confirming that i don't deserve one.**

    Here is the article: so for the past week i've been at a lan event with 10 of my friends at one of their houses. for those of you who don't know what it is, a load of pc's are put in one house or room and all connect to one router so we can all play games on one, beautifully lagless connection. my mother is one of the people who didn't know what that meant, so i thought i'd show her what it was and be all like "hey mum i do have friends, there's like 10 of them here!"

it all started well, photos of getting the pc's in, the house in general and glamour shots of everyone's set ups. i clicked to go to the next picture totally absentmindedly and what do i see? a photo i took of a friend's screen when they were browsing reddit. not so bad, right? well [this](http://i.imgur.com/jhadaol.png) is the picture in question - **nsfw** (seriously every photo here is gonna be nsfw).

*oh god oh god skip it skip it shiiiiiit*

"i didn't see that picture, you went too fast, what was it?"

"oh uh, it was pretty blurry you couldn't see much"

it just so happened that i'd copied the raw and jpeg versions of every photo to the usb stick i was viewing them from. so each photo i was showing was there twice, as well as needing to load the photo in raw which makes it veerrryyy slow on this frankly bullshit laptop. that's pretty much a fuck up in itself.

next photos are fine, just some more shots of screens and various rooms.

then comes another photo that wasn't for anyone's eyes really, let alone the eyes of my poor mother. [here you go.](http://i.imgur.com/cahxky4.png)

*fucking hell not again, i don't even remember taking this picture, skip past it*

[next photo...](http://i.imgur.com/yd5hmmw.png)

*jesus christ what the fuck were we even doing*

this one lingered for longer than the other one thanks to me skipping too fast and the usb stick not doing well under pressure. i could hear my mum reconsidering whether i'd been worth it for the last 20 years, was i the man she'd raised me to be? of fucking course not, i was browsing dick and vag tattoos with friends and taking 5k photos of them.

**skip skip skip**

[oh for fucks sake.](http://i.imgur.com/uojgmp0.png)

the silence was only broken by a frantic *click clack click clack click clack* of my keyboard. it didn't matter. she'd now seen cock blood being siphoned into the mouth of a whore.

"looks like you had fun dear."

what a good welcoming home after being away for a week. i'm sure she's happy to have me back.

    Here is the summary: dicks, chicks, mums and cock blood.

    You will be given one summary written for a news article. Your task is to rate the summary based on the following criteria:
    Output format: PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE

    Evaluation Criteria:
    1. Read the news article carefully and identify the main topic and key points.
    2. Read the summary and compare it to the news article. Check if the summary covers the main topic and key points of the news article, and if it resents them in a clear and logical order.
    3. Rate the summary with 5 percentages, where each one represents how likely the summary is going to get a score from 1 to 5. For example, if you think the summary is 80% likely to get a score of 5, 10% likely to get a score of 4, 5% likely to get a score of 3, 3% likely to get a score of 2, and 1% likely to get a score of 1, you should rate the summary as 80, 10, 5, 3, 2.

    Here is the article: so for the past week i've been at a lan event with 10 of my friends at one of their houses. for those of you who don't know what it is, a load of pc's are put in one house or room and all connect to one router so we can all play games on one, beautifully lagless connection. my mother is one of the people who didn't know what that meant, so i thought i'd show her what it was and be all like "hey mum i do have friends, there's like 10 of them here!"

it all started well, photos of getting the pc's in, the house in general and glamour shots of everyone's set ups. i clicked to go to the next picture totally absentmindedly and what do i see? a photo i took of a friend's screen when they were browsing reddit. not so bad, right? well [this](http://i.imgur.com/jhadaol.png) is the picture in question - **nsfw** (seriously every photo here is gonna be nsfw).

*oh god oh god skip it skip it shiiiiiit*

"i didn't see that picture, you went too fast, what was it?"

"oh uh, it was pretty blurry you couldn't see much"

it just so happened that i'd copied the raw and jpeg versions of every photo to the usb stick i was viewing them from. so each photo i was showing was there twice, as well as needing to load the photo in raw which makes it veerrryyy slow on this frankly bullshit laptop. that's pretty much a fuck up in itself.

next photos are fine, just some more shots of screens and various rooms.

then comes another photo that wasn't for anyone's eyes really, let alone the eyes of my poor mother. [here you go.](http://i.imgur.com/cahxky4.png)

*fucking hell not again, i don't even remember taking this picture, skip past it*

[next photo...](http://i.imgur.com/yd5hmmw.png)

*jesus christ what the fuck were we even doing*

this one lingered for longer than the other one thanks to me skipping too fast and the usb stick not doing well under pressure. i could hear my mum reconsidering whether i'd been worth it for the last 20 years, was i the man she'd raised me to be? of fucking course not, i was browsing dick and vag tattoos with friends and taking 5k photos of them.

    Here is the article: we have a conference room that also serves as a reading room (if you wish to use some of the wast company library to study there) and there is a schedule so that you know when some meetings will be held there. i forgot to read it and so this starts.

took a book, went there, felt drowsy and after a little while i dozed off.
was awakened by my direct supervisor (he is also a very very good friend of the company's ceo).

and there were also 2 of our future clients (and a very important deal was about to be signed). to make best of the situation my boss said (pure genius): "you will have to excuse our employee, he has a condition" 

(to clarify even more he meant narcolepsy)

they nodded and smiled, the pressure was wiped clean. until i had to start blabbering (why, ouh why didn’t i keep my mouth shut?) "yea, its called necrophilia!"

the look of pure shock on our clients faces, the look of exploding volcano on my bosses face... priceless. i just packed those books and left.

 

update: didn't get fired, got of with a warning, thanks to whatever higher force involved! :d

update 2: just go to work today and ofc the word spread like wildfire. guess who's the local "necro-boy" now? (that's the best they came up with so far)

    Here is the summary: : slept at the conference room, boss tried to fix the situation, i ended up making it worse.

    Here is the article: semi misleading title is misleading

first time changing out a tube on my road bike, and figured 'well, i need to go get the bike tubes from the store, so i might as well use one of the 'free change of tubes' while i'm at it.  

buy new tube, have them swap it out.  they pump to pressure to test.  yay, i can go home and ride now.

driving home, the little one is hungry, so we stop at pdq to eat.  i crack the sunroof to keep the car from getting too hot while we're eating.

come back out an hour later, and the florida sun has decided that, despite my efforts to keep the car cool, i'm go to go ahead and pop that new tube...and screw up the tire bead while i'm at it.

so...here i am at home.  i've swapped out the new tube, twice at home (the first replacement i think i pinched in the tire and screwed that one up).  the second tube is on, and the tire is back on and seeming to hold, despite the bead being less that optimal, looking online for new tires as i'd hate to get xx miles away from home and have the bead fail.

protip - next time, decrease pressure in tires if they're inside your bike while riding home in your car.

    Here is the summary: replaced bike tube and florida heat decided the new tube needed to die.

    Here is the article: this started about 2 weeks into the school year. a little back story before i begin, i signed up for a computer class last year were you do stuff with word, access, excel, powerpoint, etc. the class was scheduled for 5th period which is the first period on what we call white days because we have block scheduling with 4 periods one day and 4 more the next. i got there on time the first day because i'm never late for class considering i don't have a girlfriend or many friends. i get there and find out i have a few friends in there. i sit next to them since the teacher is nice and doesn't give us a seating chair. class is normal and boring. we decide to make an ongonig prank that would last an extremely long time. the next class we put our plan in action and go to the class slighlty early. we do this again the next time. we continue this, each time going a minute or two earlier. we eventually get to the point were we can't go any earlier because he gets there after me. the class room was connected to several others room, all of them being computer labs. we utilized those rooms as the teacher would get there after me and my friend. the semester ends, and the second half of the year begins. we are now in the advanced class, which is the same thing no clue why it's called advanced. we have several more friends in there now, by several my entire small friend group. we all begin to go to her room early. they get the idea to start messing with her, first by making her a chicken sandwich. we then made her a grilled cheese, and played grilled cheese roulet amoung ourselves. several days later they get the idea to start actually messing with her and annoying her. they start drawing on the chalk board, a lot of things, illuminati, quotes, and random thing. after our period ends she takes  the chalk hides it and erases the board. we found it. we wrote more stuff this time. she hides it again in a different spot. we bring in colored chalk, and hide the eraser. our beautiful art work stays up there for a week until the janitor comes in and erases it. we do it again. the teacher then lives for about 30 minutes of the class because she's tired of our shit. needless to say we now have a teacher that hates us and the year isn't over yet, as a result my grade has dropped from an a+ to a c. i must say my friend and i's plan worked pretty well.

    Here is the article: this happened years ago when i was very young.
i also have no pictures or anything of it, but i wish i did.

so i was little and a pyromaniac. still am. i would experiment with lighting things on fire, playing with lighters, and plying with the stove. fire is fun, isn't it?

anyway, while experimenting with fire and lighters, i found out that if you hold down the trigger of a ["long reach lighter"](https://www.identity-links.com/img/ucart/images/pimage/7788/main.jpg) and push it just far enough to the point where it doesn't click, but just far enough, the butane will come out. i figured this out on accident and it made a decently sized flash.

of course, young me decided to take a cup and hold down the trigger so the cup filled with butane. expectedly, it made a large flame, about 5" high out of the cup.

with my new superpower, i ran around the house filling everything i could find with butane, and lighting it.

i finally came across a vase. the case had a big bottom, and a tight neck, and at the top, a funnel. kind of like [this](https://img.clipartfest.com/11226f5b906bef83f91d3ae0067b975a_1000-images-about-vase-on-vase_600-600.jpeg) except the neck was tighter and the funnel was longer.

so on i go filling it up (for quite a considerable time i might add). i sat back and admired my work for a bit. the laws of physics completely left my head as i light the lighter and slowly lowered it into the vase.

in an instant, the butane light and flames and hot air literally rocketed up my arm and into my face.

i spent about half an hour with cold water on my arm, and all my arm hair was gone. luckily the burns weren't too bad, but it hurt to do anything with my arm for the day and the next.

    Here is the article: i made a hot pocket in the oven last night, and i of course needed to test if it was cool enough to eat. so i used the most appropriate method i could think of, i took a small bite[7]. superheated "cheese" comes out, but no big surprises there.

i proceeded to devour both pockets and sooth my burning lips and mouth with an icy beer. i went about my night and everything was normal. this morning i noticed i had burned my bottom lip near the right corner. it wasn't too bad, just a small blister i noticed while shaving. 

i went to work and went about my day, and proceeded to forget about my burned lip. i got off work and met up with my girlfriend. she gives me a big kiss, which then pops the blister. she pulls away quickly as i reach towards the blister. she looks at my lip and asks me what is on it. i say it's just a blister, but she just keeps staring and analyzing it. after a minute she picks up her purse and says, "no, that's herpes", calls me an asshole and accused me of cheating on her. she tells me we're over and started freaking out that she now has herpes. i keep trying to tell her it's a hot pocket burn as she leaves the bar, but she just stormed out flipping me the bird while everyone just gave me a death stare. 

i checked out myself in the mirror and the blister popped really badly, it looks pretty nasty, but i don't think it looks like herpes. 

this all happened an hour ago and she's not answering my texts or calls.

    Here is the article: okay reddit, so this fuck up actually did happen today, and its quite a fuck up so allow me to delve straight into it.

 i frequently use the sauna at my local health club, an activity that i *usually* find very relaxing - today that was not the case. let me set the scene for you reddit, their i am, fully reclined staring at the dimly lit ceiling, legs 90° with 'jonny juicehead' perched by my feet leaning over the stove posing himself ready to douse the hot stones with an aggressive splash of water. 'johny juicehead' is your typical gym rat, kind of dumb and very arrogant. he braces himself, and the water is thrown.

*splashes and hisses*

 his antics with the water caused the temperature to skyrocket and sent the little old lady who was sat above me scuttling for the door. the splash from the pool announced her successful refuge, but unlike the little old lady i was not going to be displaced by the sauna terrorist 'johny juicehead'. the battle of who could hack the insane heat the longest was on.

 damn, i'm burning up! a refreshing blast of cold water is what i need!

 still fully reclined, i reached for my bottle and poured what i thought was my salvation confidently over my face. never again. the cold water rushes down my nose, to the back of my throat and i splutter; my brain boots up into action 'i'm fucking drowning!'. i spring up 90° and spit the water out - you know where this is going - right onto the side of 'jonny juicehead's' face. i crumple down to my knees regaining my breath and take a daring look up. i lock eyes with 'jonny' judgingly staring me down. 

'i am so sorry, i think i just water-boarded my self. fuck. i'm so sorry' i pleaded to him.

'well get the fuck out you isis' he screamed back at me 'you water-boarding freak', i was actually surprised by the meat-heads knowledge of current affairs although his grammar was definitely in need of some improvements. under normal circumstance i may have corrected him, but i'd just had one near death experience and even in my disorientated state i knew i didn't want to push my luck any further. i rushed to the door, my nose stinging like shit and gasping for air.

    Here is the article: okay reddit, so this fuck up actually did happen today, and its quite a fuck up so allow me to delve straight into it.

 i frequently use the sauna at my local health club, an activity that i *usually* find very relaxing - today that was not the case. let me set the scene for you reddit, their i am, fully reclined staring at the dimly lit ceiling, legs 90° with 'jonny juicehead' perched by my feet leaning over the stove posing himself ready to douse the hot stones with an aggressive splash of water. 'johny juicehead' is your typical gym rat, kind of dumb and very arrogant. he braces himself, and the water is thrown.

*splashes and hisses*

 his antics with the water caused the temperature to skyrocket and sent the little old lady who was sat above me scuttling for the door. the splash from the pool announced her successful refuge, but unlike the little old lady i was not going to be displaced by the sauna terrorist 'johny juicehead'. the battle of who could hack the insane heat the longest was on.

 damn, i'm burning up! a refreshing blast of cold water is what i need!

 still fully reclined, i reached for my bottle and poured what i thought was my salvation confidently over my face. never again. the cold water rushes down my nose, to the back of my throat and i splutter; my brain boots up into action 'i'm fucking drowning!'. i spring up 90° and spit the water out - you know where this is going - right onto the side of 'jonny juicehead's' face. i crumple down to my knees regaining my breath and take a daring look up. i lock eyes with 'jonny' judgingly staring me down. 

'i am so sorry, i think i just water-boarded my self. fuck. i'm so sorry' i pleaded to him.

'well get the fuck out you isis' he screamed back at me 'you water-boarding freak', i was actually surprised by the meat-heads knowledge of current affairs although his grammar was definitely in need of some improvements. under normal circumstance i may have corrected him, but i'd just had one near death experience and even in my disorientated state i knew i didn't want to push my luck any further. i rushed to the door, my nose stinging like shit and gasping for air.

    Here is the summary: I frequently use the sauna at my local health club, an activity that I usually find very relaxing.

this isnt entirely too bad, its actually pretty funny so here it is:

christmas morning and whatnot. my family is coming over later so i put on something nice, you know khakis and a nice sweater. i lay down and decide to play a little bit of destiny, my girlfriend calls me on facetime and the nice guy i am, i decide to stop gaming and talk to her. this would be where the fuckup happens.

    Here is the article: so i'm just your average high school student with a job at a small ice cream store. so i was working with my coworker and i was supposed to be making waffle cones (we make our own). so i put one to heat on the waffle cone maker and kinda forgot about it. as me and my coworker chatted, surfed the internet, and sold some ice cream, the forgotten waffle cone was left alone, with no chance of survival. after about 30 minutes passed, i started to smell something burning and it hit me... the lone waffle cone was left in the make for half an hour. as i pry the top open, literally, my coworker asks me "did you leave one in there?" i immediately respond with "no," as i get it open because i didn't remember that i had. i checked to see if there was a burnt cone inside and said "no" again, not seeing anything. with a closer look, i see a waffle cone blacker than anything i've ever seen. the charred cone was blended in with the maker (the inside of the waffle cone maker is black) so it's only natural that i didn't see anything at first glance. i take the black waffle cone out and realize that it's even more black that i initially thought. me and my coworker burst out laughing, thinking only of the joke potential that comes out of a waffle cone black and as burnt as can be. a while later, my boss comes back... he walks in and says "why the fuck does this place smell like the holocaust?!" i try to explain that i went to take a shit for 20 mins and forgot about the cone, which didn't get me very far as i shouldn't have been taking a 20 minute shit while working (i could not have played this off as a 5 minute burn, the smell was far too worse, resembling burning flesh). my boss didn't come back until at least an hour after the event, and the smell was like a hitler has risen up in africa, burning all the flesh. as i got chewed out, my coworker couldn't keep from hysterically cracking up (probably thinking of the racial joke potential of the whole situation which could make him internet famous).

    Here is the summary: we both got fired, me for being a horrible employee that slacks on the job, and him for thinking my fuck up was hilarious. needless to say, i fucked up today at work

    Here is the article: for some reason there are quite a few rabbits in my neighborhood, and occasionally one finds a way inside our fence. while hanging out in the backyard with our dogs, my girlfriend notices that there is a rabbit sitting next to the fence frozen stiff because of the dogs. me, being a smartass, starts taunting her 60lb blue heeler mix "hey, look at the bunny! go get the bunny!" i figure that even if the dog sees the rabbit, it should be able to escape in time.

the first time the dog looks in the direction of the rabbit, she doesn't even see it because it's standing perfectly still. the dog turns away and the rabbit tries to make its escape .. just in time for the dog to catch it moving against the fence. the rabbit takes off, the dog takes off, and in less than 3 seconds the 60lb dog is right on the rabbits tail. squealing ensues (both from the rabbit and my girlfriend), fur flies, and bunny manages to escape briefly. the dog takes off again but i manage to grab the dog after the 2nd time she captures the rabbit and pull her away. at this point, the rabbit is still moving and able to run/hop about 30ft to the house, though it's missing a bit of fur on its back.

my girlfriend grabs a blanket to pick up the rabbit and carry it outside the fence. it's breathing heavy but not really moving, so we figure it's just freaked out and won't move with us standing there. we step away a bit and it takes a couple steps then stops again. now i'm thinking "shit, i'm gonna have to finish this thing off so it doesn't suffer" while trying to console my girlfriend who is pissed at me for taunting the dog and horrified that her dog may have killed an innocent little bunny.

we go inside for a few minutes to let the rabbit chill and wash off the dog while we discuss taking it to animal rescue or figuring out a way to humanely dispatch the poor creature if it comes to that. when we step outside to check on the rabbit again, it tries to hop once then its whole body goes stiff as a board and flops over on its side. shit. cue more crying from my girlfriend and my level of guilt increasing exponentially. not sure if it had a broken spine or some internal injuries, but it went pretty quick.

now every time we see a rabbit around, i get punched in the arm.

    Here is the summary: never underestimate the acceleration of a dog chasing something small and furry.

    Here is the article: legit like 5 minutes ago. there's this super pretty girl that i dig, a lot. have for a bit. we talk on and off through facebook, and we both do music. she's been interested in coming by my studio, but it hasn't really panned out. we talk occasionally, but tonight we had a long conversation. it started with music, and turned into this crazy, awesome, deep conversation. it started with me joking about disliking her, in which she challenged me on the point. we then started delving into each other's personalities and exposing each other's flaws in this crazy battle of wits, in which we finally secured my offer of taking her out sometime. the conversation died down a bit, so i threw in an off key joke. 

"this entire conversation is like a john green novel." i said. (john green is an author who writes super cheesy teen books about romance and death and stuff.)

she replied with "god we are getting so deep its making my heart feel like its gna collapse" sarcastically.

me being me, i said "that's what she said."

i got a one word reply, simply stating "goodnight." and she was offline before i could complain. i realize we'll probably be good soon enough, but god damn that felt shitty.

    Here is the article: it was my first weekend in college and i was surprised by the amount of drinking and partying that was going on around me. i wasn't exposed too much alcohol during my high school years and i was excited to try something new with new people. house invited out to my friends apartment for a party and as soon as i got there i began to down fruity drinks he was making. things are fine for about an hour and after that i didn't remember much.

fast forward to the next morning when i woke up with a raging headache and an evening i did not remember. i was living in the dorms was that guy i had just met and he was nowhere to be found. i found my cellphone in the sink and there were numerous text messages from him and my friend whos appartment i was at,and this is where the i started remembering my night a bit more. 

my friend had told me that i was dancing with a girl that was a complete bombshell (way out of my league from pics he showed me). i guess i started to feel her up and was making a huge deal about it. she left and i tried to follow but my buddy did not let me. after that i passed out in a chair for awhile. i woke up orderd pizza and began to walk back to the dorms with it. this wasn't even close to the worst of it.

my roommate filled in the rest of my night. i got back to the room with the pizza and ate some of it and decided it would be a good idea to go check out the floor lounge to see who was in it. i also thought it was a good idea to take my roommates fireball with me. i was taking drinks out of the fireball in the floor lounge with people i had never met (i was 18 and no alcohol was allowed on campus so not so good). i then went back to the room grabbed a bag of doritos tried to open it but failed and spilled it all over the lounge. 

my roommate took me back and tried to get me to go to bed but as soon as i lay down i started to not feel so good. i guess i thought it was a good idea to chug three glasses of water and lay back down...nope. i projectile vomited off the top bunk of my bed, all over the floor and on to my roommates stuff. being the the great guy he is,he gave me paper towels and left. oh and i broke his toothbrush holder.

    Here is the article: this happened a couple days ago but i'm still a little shook up.

 so in a lot of my free time i decide to dumpster dive at a few select places. one of the places i go to is where i get the majority of my food to eat, since this place throws hundreds of dollars worth of food out daily. on this specific day though, the temperature is 20 degrees f and we're having 40+ mph winds. there are two dumpsters, a huge one that most of everything is, and a very small one that can be pushed around. so i'm doing my thing and scavenging, when i realize i forgot my gloves at home. not a big deal, i'll be fast right? the wind is brutal in that position and my fingers start to get frozen very fast, but here comes the fuck up. i decide to look in the very small dumpster to see if it has anything. has some soda in it but mostly trash, so i jump on the side and reach in, at the same time the wind gusts to god knows what and flips the dumpster on top of me, pinning my ankle to the ground and efficiently suffocating me with bags of trash. i end up trying to find my flashlight while trying to breathe from an avalanche of trash. i finally found it and ended up getting my ankle unpinned from the dumpster on it. i swam up to the top of the dumpster and had to call a friend so he could help me lift the dumpster so i wasn't trapped in it. friend finally showed up to find me almost hypothermic and my hands turning blue. didn't lose anything though and ended up fine.

 

edit 1:  holy shit this blew up, and yes, i get a lot of the food because we're pretty poor, whatever i don't use i donate to food pantries, local families and friends, and invite people over to teach them how to cook food for themselves. 

edit 2: my highest upvoted post is about me almost dying, thanks reddit

    Here is the article: so today (wow, today!) i was at my cousin's birthday party. he's still really young, he was turning 6. (for reference, i am 16, too old for a kids party but too young to sit with the adults and drink beer) we go to a bowling alley where they do kids parties, and everything is going well, i get a few strikes, everyone's happy. 

then we go into the party room, where we are served the food. you can imagine how out of place i felt, towering over these tiny kids as we eat "food" with plastic cutlery and the mandatory party hat on our heads. the other kids realise this too. the little girl who i was facing looks at me inquisitively.

little girl: "excuse me. how old are you?"

me: sixteen.

lg: oh. i'm seven.

me: hi seven, i'm dad.

her eyes widen, almost as if they were going to pop right out of her head and bail, and a look of absolute euphoria spreads across her face. she jumps up and runs to me, hugging me, kissing whatever part of me she could reach, saying "oh daddy! i've missed you! where have you been?" 

me, confused as all hell, looks at the adults for some kind of support / explanation, and i was met with mostly disappointed or angry looks. one particular angry look was from this little girl's mother. she storms up to me, grabs her daughter, and walks off. they talk in the corner for a minute, and the little girl bursts into tears. mother and daughter exit the building. 

my mum looks at me with complete disdain, and asks me why the fuck i said what i had said (all adults were close by, within hearing distance of the little girl and i). i told her that i thought it was kind of funny, and it might make her laugh. she shakes her head and tells me the story.

this little girl's dad did a walkout several months after she was born. her parents were fighting, the dad was an alcoholic, and after one particularly nasty argument, he packs his stuff and straight up bails on the family. the girl was too young to remember her father's appearance, but treasures the memory of his presence. when i said i was her dad, all she wanted to do was believe her dad was back, despite the unlikeliness and improbability of it. 

in other words, i broke her fucking heart. 

i am now sitting at home, contemplating my previous decisions, privately resolving to not show my face amongst my extended family for a while, and feeling like the worst human being to have lived. 

 

**edit** thank you all for the words of support / the proper delivery of a dad joke. i should have indeed said my own name, that would have saved me from a bit of pain. for those telling me to send an apology note, i could but it would seem out of place. she never knew my actual name, she was just another girl amongst 20 or so other kids, and not a part of my family, just a friend of my cousin's. and for those asking, i won't be hooking up with the girl's mum. i feel bad saying that she *wasn't* hot, i'm sure she was in her day. right now she just looks worn and tired.

    Here is the summary: if you make a dad joke without being a dad, it must be bad karma or something because i convinced a basically fatherless child i was her dad.

my mum looks at me with complete disdain, and asks me why the fuck i said what i had said (all adults were close by, within hearing distance of the little girl and i). i told her that i thought it was kind of funny, and it might make her laugh. she shakes her head and tells me the story.

this little girl's dad did a walkout several months after she was born. her parents were fighting, the dad was an alcoholic, and after one particularly nasty argument, he packs his stuff and straight up bails on the family. the girl was too young to remember her father's appearance, but treasures the memory of his presence. when i said i was her dad, all she wanted to do was believe her dad was back, despite the unlikeliness and improbability of it. 

in other words, i broke her fucking heart. 

i am now sitting at home, contemplating my previous decisions, privately resolving to not show my face amongst my extended family for a while, and feeling like the worst human being to have lived. 

 

**edit** thank you all for the words of support / the proper delivery of a dad joke. i should have indeed said my own name, that would have saved me from a bit of pain. for those telling me to send an apology note, i could but it would seem out of place. she never knew my actual name, she was just another girl amongst 20 or so other kids, and not a part of my family, just a friend of my cousin's. and for those asking, i won't be hooking up with the girl's mum. i feel bad saying that she *wasn't* hot, i'm sure she was in her day. right now she just looks worn and tired.

    Here is the summary: I was at my cousin's birthday party.

    Here is the article: so today (wow, today!) i was at my cousin's birthday party. he's still really young, he was turning 6. (for reference, i am 16, too old for a kids party but too young to sit with the adults and drink beer) we go to a bowling alley where they do kids parties, and everything is going well, i get a few strikes, everyone's happy. 

then we go into the party room, where we are served the food. you can imagine how out of place i felt, towering over these tiny kids as we eat "food" with plastic cutlery and the mandatory party hat on our heads. the other kids realise this too. the little girl who i was facing looks at me inquisitively.

little girl: "excuse me. how old are you?"

me: sixteen.

lg: oh. i'm seven.

me: hi seven, i'm dad.

her eyes widen, almost as if they were going to pop right out of her head and bail, and a look of absolute euphoria spreads across her face. she jumps up and runs to me, hugging me, kissing whatever part of me she could reach, saying "oh daddy! i've missed you! where have you been?"

    Here is the article: hey reddit! this happened on sunday. 

so there i was, half in the bag at my best friend's engagement and housewarming party. family and friends were gathered all around his well decorated new living room. everyone is having a delightful time. the room is buzzing with side conversations, light music is playing in the back ground, his new fiance is cooking some small appetizers with the other ladies and the guys are all drinking beer and chit-chatting about finishing the basement, how nice the driveway is and how great he (best friend) is doing. 

my girlfriend (my shy, very intelligent, beautiful girlfriend) is sitting in between two of the oldest friends of the couple's family. i sit next to her and gently place my hand on her thigh to let her know that i'm there. she smiles and whispers to me, asking for a bottle of water. i return quickly in my idiotic stupor and hand it to her like a good dog. she, given her sense of humor, eye-balls be from the side and dramatically throws her head back as if to take a long, slow drink of this sweet nectar of the gods. 

when out of nowhere i squeeze the water bottle, ramming +8oz of water down her throat.

immediately i see her eyes get huge and she begins to choke, spitting water all over her new pants, sweater, floor and almost throwing up on the family friends while i run around the kitchen looking for paper towels. 

i apologized immediately after, wondering why the hell it seemed so funny in my head, while she laughed and cried hysterically. (yes, she thought it was hilarious.) the only other people who thought it was a riot was my brother, best friend and his fiance. 

everyone else was baffled by "how much of an asshole that i am," and proceeded to spend the rest of the evening giving me dirty looks, making snarky comments like *"if you don't want to ride home with him, you don't have to"* and the like.

    Here is the summary: made my shy girlfriend deep throat the contents of a poland springs bottle in front of old people at an engagement party and spent the evening being judged.

    Here is the article: so last night my roommate and i were bored and decided we would play a drinking game. we found a typical template for a drinking game based around the show the league. needless to say, like most of these games, it's impossible to finish an episode without nearly dying of alcohol poisoning. ten shots of vodka later, my roommate and i find ourselves stumbling about for a couple hours, talking to friends and what not. we were enjoying the drunken bliss. 

in the state i was in i quickly lost track of the whereabouts of my roomie and went on a search to find him. as i stumble back to the room an incredible desire to shit begins to take hold of me. now to paint the picture of this dorm, our room is literally 5 feet from the bathroom. however, my drunken brain convinced me that i would not make that distance and so i was left with one option... hanging off his bed post was his open backpack, and it is there that i proceeded to unload a torrent of vicious, alcohol induced sludge that nearly filled the poor bag to the brim. it blacks out from there and next thing i know i am in the bathroom stall bracing against the walls as the room spins and collapse around me. all i have on is a soggy pair of shit smeared boxers tangled around my ankles as i desperately try to go to the bathroom. then i feel like i'm going to throw up. in what can only be described as an astoundingly coordinated shifting of my body i managed to throw up into the toilet. i must say at this point, for all of the bodily fluids coming out of me i managed to keep them contained well. not a drop of shit hit the floor. by this time i make it back to the room and the roommates back. i collapse onto my bed and pass out. 

by the time i wake up it is nearly noon and i notice a very distinct smell. up until this point i had totally forgotten what i had done. then i remember... i spring up and this wakes up my roommate. "what is that smell?" he asks. "it smells like shit..." i get up and as i walk about the room i already know what i've done. yet, i still check the trash cans hoping that maybe, just maybe i didn't really do it. they are both empty and as we slowly approach the backpack a look ambivalence spread across his face. he described it as being perversely impressed. impressed that i managed not to shit on the floor, upset that it was in his backpack. luckily he had removed his books so the only damage was to the backpack itself. however, his wallet that was in the front pouch managed to absorb the liquid shit and now retains a distinctive odor of ass slop. 

we decided to throw the bag away... i was also now required to replace not only the bag but also the wallet. i gave him my extra backpack and in my spare time made him a pretty banging duct tape wallet. and i had to ride a bike 2 miles in order to get him chipotle while hungover and practically vomiting the whole way there and back.

    Here is the article: so over the past few months my girlfriend and i have talked about getting kinda frisky in the bedroom, i've always like the idea so a few days ago i ordered some restraints off of amazon. earlier today the restraints came in the mail so being the curious guy i am i decided i would set them up to see how they work, that was my first mistake.  there were no instructions so i just set them up as described in the picture and description, it took about 5 minutes or so. after i had the restraints set up i got even more curious and i decided to set them up in advance and maybe try them out to see how they feel, me thinking that they are more of a gag gift kinda thing and probably easily removed. 

after i properly sized them to my height i decided to strap myself in they were very comfy and way to easy to put on by myself. it took my about 15 seconds or so to realize how badly i actually fucked up, laying there panicked for about 5 minutes i finally started to make some progress on the velcro but sadly it had my arm in a weird direction and i wasn't able to set myself free. by this point about 20 minutes has passed of me accepting my fate and i realized i had the "hey siri" function enabled on my iphone only problem is that my girlfriend is on the other side of the country until monday.

running out of options i decided to call my tenant who is renting out a lower floor in my house. he answered and very quickly came to rescue me as i was still tied to my bed in my room, at least i had the brains to put on a shirt and underwear before attempting self bdsm or this could have ended a whole lot worse. it's been a few hours and he hasn't told me he's moving out yet so i think i'm in the clear.

    Here is the summary: bought restraints so my so and i could have kinky intimate time and ended up cuffing myself to my bed and having to use siri to call my tenant to free me.

    Here is the article: so this actually happened a few months ago.

i was sent out to another city for work and found myself living alone for the first time in my life (yay for mom's basement).  it was overwhelming at first not knowing anyone but i eventually made friends who also were there as expatriates and we hung out a lot.

so fast forward a few months  a friend of mine brings along a group of girls to chill and we hang out for the night. i start talking to this one girl (we'll call her katie) and we  hit it off well, we had lots of common interests and we had so much to talk about. she was pretty cute but i never thought of starting any relationships because i wouldn't be in the city for long and i thought i was destined to live the life of the 40 year old virgin.

fast forward another few months and it's my last night in the city. so katie and a few of our friends went out clubbing one last time.  we get tipsy and she starts getting a little touchy with me but i didn't think anything of it cause were all intoxicated. people start leaving one by anime and its just katie and i left. we don't want to go home yet so we were just walked around sobering up. after a while decides she wants to find some friends and asks me to come along. so i oblige and we go chill with her friends for a bit. it's about 4am at this point so we all decide to cab home. now this is the first fuck up . so we all go to where the cabs all line up to pick up drunkards and all of katie's friends get into cabs. now it's katie's turn to get into a cab and being the gentleman i am i open the door for her and let her get in. boom close the door and off the taxi goes. she texts me and is like wtf i thought you were coming with me. i replied 'no i can't were going different directions.' she calls me and sounds very upset and so i promise her id go see her after i got home to finish packing. 

i finish packing and cab over to her place. i told her my flight is  late that afternoon so i didn't have too much time to see her. she said it was fine and she just wanted to see me one last time. it's important to note i was wearing my plane grub. i get to her place and she comments on the fact that i'm wearing sweats in such hot weather. so we head inside and go to her room. she suggests i take my sweater off so i don't get a heat stroke. i was wearing a really shitty undershirt so i declined at first but did after i started sweating buckets. then after she comments 'wow your time in the gym is starting to pay off'. i blush as no one has complimented my body like that before and replied 'thanks but progress hasn't been too great.' she then replies in excitement 'wow progress? can i critique your physique? i have lots of experience.' being close but that close i declined and she said 'if you show me yours i'll show you mine.' being retarded me i was like no thanks it don't want to see your physique. after hearing that she got frustrated and tries a few more times before hopping into her bed and burying herself under her covers. in her upset tone she says she's going to nap until she has to go for work (that would be when i had to head out to the airport too). so i sit there surfing reddit until she got up. she then asks me to grab a pair of pants for her to change into for work. so i do but as i walked over with them she asks me to help her change into them because she was tired. and retardedly i tell her hell no and tell her to do it herself. she storms out(she was fully clothed, was never naked) and changes and says we have to go. so we go our separate ways and as i'm going to the airport i get a bunch of texts explaining what could've been.......

    Here is the article: this happened over a year ago but i can never forget.  so i'm getting off an international flight from chicago to frankfurt.  i woke up on the plane during descent and didn't get a change to use the bathroom prior to landing so needless to say, that was the first thing i was looking for when i got off the plane.  since it's international, it always seems like a long walk through a maze that ends in passport control.  luckily there was a small bathroom in route and since i was moving like a man on a mission, i was toward the front of the pack of walking passengers. 

i roll into this tiny bathroom and immediately remember that the luxurious elbow room one is afforded in the us is someone more restricted in most of europe.  there are three urinals very close together with no dividers and the outside two are already taken.  normally the male urinal code would dictate i use the stall but it was also full and there were several people filling in behind me.  i pull up to the middle and begin the obvious process.  it is during this process i notice my urinal is abnormally full and getting fuller.  like this sucker is near the brim of overflowing and i don't see the liquid level falling at all.  stopping my deposit is not an option but my volume estimate is telling me i should be just ok.  at this point i realize that this is one of those automatic flush deals and the quick flashing led is letting me know this puppy is armed.  the gentleman a centimeter from my right shoulder leaves his urinal which immediately flushes with the power of a waterfall on steroids.  fuck.  i'm coming to the end of my time as middle urinal user and immediately gain a new neighbor to my right.  do i warn them?  both my right and left neighbor are talking in german; i don't know german.  i end my deposit and get wrapped up.  there is an obvious line out the door and i can't stand there forever.  the liquid level in my urinal is at the brim and the led is telling me that unless i know a dearm code, this baby is going nuclear the moment i leave.  i zip up and bolt for the door.  behind me i hear the roar of the flush system engage followed by the screams.  i'll never forget the screams.

    Here is the summary: i took a leak in a very plugged urinal and only noticed when the auto flush was already armed.  when i left, the crowded bathroom became a waterpark.

    Here is the article: i'm currently spending my summer semester at university just outside of london. most nights, i open up my windows to let a cool breeze come through. it doesn't get too hot around here. insects are not usually a problem. the past few days, however, have been exceptionally hot. 


i spent my afternoon in my room at my desk. the occasional fly would fly by and i'd swat at it. i didn't think much of it. fast forward to 15 minutes ago. i'm getting ready for bed, when i look up at the ceiling. there are thousands. thousands of mosquitoes flying around the lights and just chilling on the ceiling. this is what they talk about when they say "plague." there's absolutely no way i'm sleeping in this room without losing a litre of blood overnight. 

so i did the logical thing and grabbed my blanket and went into the bathroom. tonight is going to be fun.

    Here is the summary: i left my window open, mosquitoes swarmed, i'm now sleeping in my bathroom.

    Here is the article: i'm on mobile so sorry for mistakes.

so this happened a few months back, i was walking downstairs with my toothbrush and toothpaste, not a care in the world but when i got down there i felt hungry. not too hungry but just hungry enough for a small snack, my parents hadn't gone to the store in awhile so there wern't any energy bars or dry cereal to sooth my hunger but like a night in organic grass fed shining armor i notice that we have fruit.

we keep our fruit in a little basket on the counter and when i see this basket is loaded i get exited! we buy fruit regularly but i live in a big family so it usually gets eaten up fairly quickly, though when i take a closer look i find that it only has some expired tomatoes, key limes, and one single aged jalapeño pepper, eged to the point that it's red. now for those of you who don't know, jalapeño peppers get hotter as they age, much hotter. and this jalapeño has been sitting here for like, a year... i'm not 100% sure how long it's been ther but it is dark red at this point.

so being my stupid, hungry self i decide that at this point "it can't be that hot" and "maybe at this point the spice has actually died down" so i decide to cut like one tiny part off the tail and eat it. and after a second i'm like "yup, i was right, this thing isn't that hot!"

but then two seconds later my mouth felt like i was eating satan's pubic hair. my mouth felt like a mass extinction gone volcanic. so i rush over to the fridge and start chugging milk, and i mean chugging. i had finished off like an eigth of the one gallon milk carton in five minutes! yet somehow, that still wasn't enough.

so i go grab the ice cream, and the ice cream scoop while my mouth still feels like a heavily salted cut on ten different drugs and start eating away, this helped more than the milk but it still wasn't enough. after 4 minutes or so of ice cream i grab a cup and pour some milk in and then mix cream into it. this doesn't do much more than regular milk.

but then i have a stroke of genius and decide to make a milkshake, i pour in some ice cream, add some cream, some regular milk, and within a few seconds of mixing i become gordon fucking ramsay. so then 15 minutes and 18 milkshakeslater i can go to bed extreamly nauseated all because of one fraction of a jalapeño...

the next morning my parents ask what happened to the milk to wich i don't respond... also i never brushed my teeth...

    Here is the summary: i ate some jalapeño as a snack and ended up staying up 40 minutes past my bedtime drinking makeshift milkshakes getting progressively more nauseous.

    Here is the article: this didn't happen today, but i just thought i would share one of our stories, so enjoy!

my wife and i met while we were both working on a very small cruise ship in alaska. so this story is while we were "dating", and i put that in quotes becuase we weren't supposed to be dating so it was more like we were best friends who had some secret benefits ;-). so this one time we were out kayaking and checking out this bear who was catching fish on a small waterfall that flowed into a kind of flat shallow bit before making a hard drop to the rest of the inlet. so we are just watching him catch fish and eat them like a badass, as bears do.. when he catches wind of us and finally notice that we are about maybe 100 ft away kinda close to the flat part. so he leisurely walks down from the top of the waterfall and starts to come towards us. by this time both of us are realizing its definitely time to gtfo so we go to backup(ps we are both in single kayaks beside each other). what we then realized is that in the 10 or so minutes that we were sitting there, the tide went down enough that we were now sitting on the rock that made up this flat bit, with only about 2-3 inches of water. by now the bear is getting a lot more curious and is starting to actually come towards us in a relatively slow walk, but definitely coming at us. so we are both trying to shimmy and scoot our boats off this rock when we find out that we are not just on a flat rock, but in more of a hole that is higher in the back, preventing us from sliding out into the open water. now i will mention at this point that this is alaska and the water is about 40o f degrees so jumping out of the kayak isn't an option, and lets be honest.. a bear could out swim us anyways. so here we are, side by side, with a bear coming at us, trying to jump and slide our kayaks back into the water. in the mean time, the bear is officially curious and has started to kinda trot towards the two dumb ass kayakers that decided to interfere with his dinner. now we are both pretty worried at this point because i have neither a gun, nor bear spray to keep this big ass bear from having the two of us for his main entree. so as i am looking around desperately to find a way to get out without having to get out of my kayak, i see that there is a little outlet about two feet to my left(wife is on my right). so i put my paddle on my lap, and use my hands to shimmy myself and my boat over a bit and slide out into freedom.. now you must remember that i had not been in a relationship long enough for me to think of 'we' but rather, in the panic of the moment there was only a 'me' as far as self preservation goes... so i slide out into the free water and suddenly remember that there was in fact another human in this scenario. so i look back to my now wife who just make a glance to her left to discover than her knight in shinning armor was no longer at her side but had abandoned her to have her second run in with a bear that month(another story). in conclusion, my wife obviously was moments behind me, and is obviously safe and unhurt, though she still brings up the story of the time i bailed on her when a bear charged us.

    Here is the summary: my girl and i were getting charged by a bear and i kinda left her behind but not really...

my wife and i met while we were both working on a very small cruise ship in alaska. so this story is while we were "dating", and i put that in quotes becuase we weren't supposed to be dating so it was more like we were best friends who had some secret benefits ;-). so this one time we were out kayaking and checking out this bear who was catching fish on a small waterfall that flowed into a kind of flat shallow bit before making a hard drop to the rest of the inlet. so we are just watching him catch fish and eat them like a badass, as bears do.. when he catches wind of us and finally notice that we are about maybe 100 ft away kinda close to the flat part. so he leisurely walks down from the top of the waterfall and starts to come towards us. by this time both of us are realizing its definitely time to gtfo so we go to backup(ps we are both in single kayaks beside each other). what we then realized is that in the 10 or so minutes that we were sitting there, the tide went down enough that we were now sitting on the rock that made up this flat bit, with only about 2-3 inches of water. by now the bear is getting a lot more curious and is starting to actually come towards us in a relatively slow walk, but definitely coming at us. so we are both trying to shimmy and scoot our boats off this rock when we find out that we are not just on a flat rock, but in more of a hole that is higher in the back, preventing us from sliding out into the open water. now i will mention at this point that this is alaska and the water is about 40o f degrees so jumping out of the kayak isn't an option, and lets be honest.. a bear could out swim us anyways. so here we are, side by side, with a bear coming at us, trying to jump and slide our kayaks back into the water. in the mean time, the bear is officially curious and has started to kinda trot towards the two dumb ass kayakers that decided to interfere with his dinner. now we are both pretty worried at this point because i have neither a gun, nor bear spray to keep this big ass bear from having the two of us for his main entree. so as i am looking around desperately to find a way to get out without having to get out of my kayak, i see that there is a little outlet about two feet to my left(wife is on my right). so i put my paddle on my lap, and use my hands to shimmy myself and my boat over a bit and slide out into freedom.. now you must remember that i had not been in a relationship long enough for me to think of 'we' but rather, in the panic of the moment there was only a 'me' as far as self preservation goes... so i slide out into the free water and suddenly remember that there was in fact another human in this scenario. so i look back to my now wife who just make a glance to her left to discover than her knight in shinning armor was no longer at her side but had abandoned her to have her second run in with a bear that month(another story). in conclusion, my wife obviously was moments behind me, and is obviously safe and unhurt, though she still brings up the story of the time i bailed on her when a bear charged us.

    Here is the summary: We met while working on a small cruise ship in Alaska.

    Here is the article: (throwaway account, obviously) (also, english is not my first language)

this happened last sunday evening, but i waited for the weekend to make this post, because rules. also, to give time for my dick to recover and see how things develop.

it was late in the evening (around 11pm-midnight), and i decided to smoke some weed. got quite high, and wanted to masturbate. it is one of my favourite things to do when i get high alone, because the feeling becomes so intense, and my dick feels much more sensitive when i'm high. 

i am also somewhat into bdsm and masochistic things. first, i just looked at some of my usual porn and tried to fap normally, but then i wanted to try something different. being the kinky bastard that i am, i wanted to see what would happen if i tried to wrap rubber bands around my dick, very tightly (being high, i didn't quite think about the implications of it).

i found 4 small (around 1 cm in diameter) rubber bands in a drawer in my room. i held my dick when it wasn't particularly erect, because it is easier to fit rubber bands onto it when it's smaller, and i tried to see how many times i could wrap a single one of those small rubber bands around it. i managed three. it was very tight, but didn't hurt nearly as much as i expected it to. so i took another rubber band and did the same thing on top of the first one. and then the the same with the rest of the rubber bands.

so, i ended up having 4 rubber bands around my dick, each one wrapped 3 times. it was tight as fuck. i used my hand to try and pump blood through the rubber bands into my dick, to get my dick as hard as possible. with all the blood held inside my dick by the rubber bands, it was bigger than i had ever seen it before. i tried to fap like that; the feeling was very weird and interesting, but i just couldn't cum.

obviously, any kind of blood circulation had stopped, as no blood could exit my dick. i didn't intend to keep the rubber bands on for long; i (obviously) didn't want to destroy/kill my dick. but i kinda lost track of time. at least 15-20 min must have passed, possibly even more. my dick started turning dark in colour; the skin was almost black. then, i realized just how numb my dick was; i could barely feel anything. it was almost like i wasn't touching my own body, but some foreign object. it also felt very cold on my hand. i felt very scared for my dick. so, i went to try to remove the rubber bands.

the rubber bands were very tight, and could not be removed with just my fingers. i used a toothpick to try and pull them off my dick slightly, enough to insert the tip of a small pair of scissors and cut them. it took me around 5-10 min to remove all rubber bands. this was honestly one of the most painful things i've ever felt. as each rubber band came off and my dick became less squeezed, i felt sharp, piercing pain on the skin where the rubber band was. but i had to deal with it. i couldn't leave the rubber bands on my dick. it was quite numb as it was.

after removing the rubber bands and waiting for the pain to fade out, i tried to fap again. but my dick was still numb, and i couldn't feel anything. i got even more worried. scary thoughts about my dick never regaining sensitivity again started to creep into my mind. i thought that it will probably be fine by morning, so i tried to get myself to fall asleep. took me a while, especially after having stimulated my dick so much without getting to actually cum, but eventually i did.

when i woke up in the morning, i touched my dick again. it was just as numb as before. i could get an erection, but i felt nothing when i touched it. the feeling was very, very strange and foreign. there was also a slight scar on the skin, where the rubber bands were. this time, i was really scared. i was thinking, if it was still numb after a whole night, maybe i had fucked it up permanently?

in panic, i contacted a doctor. he said to give it at least 3 days or so, and that it should regain sensitivity, as long as the blood circulation was fine (which it was, since i could get an erection). needless to say, i couldn't fap for a few days, because i couldn't feel my dick.

now, almost a week later, my dick seems to be more-or-less ok. my foreskin still feels somewhat numb when i pull on it, but other than that, i can fap, and the rest of my dick feels ok. i still think it is overall a bit less sensitive than it used to be before, but maybe i am making this up. anyway, i feel so happy that i can actually fap again, and that my dick feels more or less fine. i am so glad i didn't actually fuck it up (except for my foreskin; it used to be quite sensitive, but now still feels a bit numb; hopefully that recovers, too, but almost a week has passed already and it still feels less sensitive than i remember it). lesson learned. never doing anything like this again. it was scary as fuck.

    Here is the summary: got high, wrapped 4 small rubber bands around my dick, 3 times each, and pumped blood into my dick with my hand; stayed like that for some time; dick went incredibly numb; got scared as fuck; removed the rubber bands; couldn't feel my dick for a few days and couldn't fap, but seems to have mostly recovered by now.

    Here is the article: so obviously this was a few months ago. i had a new airsoft smg and a pistol and wanted to use it at my friend's house. my other friend was over, so we decided to bring more over. my other friend, let's call him mark, says we should have him come over. i decide that we should go over to his house instead (with my brother included). mark disagrees but we just go, me forgetting that i told my friend he could come over, it was a short walk anyways. we turn on some music on our phones and we walk through the streets, me with my big smg in my hand. mark has the pistol bb gun i gave him hidden in his pocket and my brother doesn't have one (my friend was gonna give him an extra when we got there).
now for some reason i decided to have the gun out with me as we walk through the streets instead of in a bag, and i even walk with it as if i was in call of duty. we see my friend's dad driving over to us to pick us up, thinking they were gonna come to our house. then all of the sudden, cops pull us over. they tell us to drop our weapons, and threaten us. now being the 15 year old kid who's never been confronted by a cop, i get scared as hell. the cop said we were lucky he saw the orange part or he would have had to take out a real gun. so then more cop cars show up and inspect our guns, and even tell me to call my mom. i give the cop my phone and he talks with my mom, and accuses me of lying t my mom about what we were gonna do. i say "what?" and he says that i said we were just going to hang out at our house and i'm like "yeah... we changed plans when we left". at this point one of the cop cars come up, and i know one of the cops personally (father of a kid who used to go on my bus in middle school) and i'm a little calmer.
i tell them i just didn't think and i shoulda kept the guns in a bag, and they told me "yeah, this is frankly a pretty silly thing to do guys." so we apologize and the cops let us off with a warning. they tell us this stuff happens on the news and people get killed (i actuallly told him i wasn't so familiar with this kind of thing because i almost never see guys with pellet guns get killed by cops on news). mark, who is black, actually said (this made me chuckle a little) "i'm lucky, if it was just me with the gun they woulda shot me cause i'm black". i've actually never been so scared in my life, but at least my mom was calm, dad wasn't.

    Here is the summary: went over to friends house to play with airsoft guns, while me walking with smg in my hands for all to see, got confronted by cops, almost shot, etc. etc., was not a good day.**

i tell them i just didn't think and i shoulda kept the guns in a bag, and they told me "yeah, this is frankly a pretty silly thing to do guys." so we apologize and the cops let us off with a warning. they tell us this stuff happens on the news and people get killed (i actuallly told him i wasn't so familiar with this kind of thing because i almost never see guys with pellet guns get killed by cops on news). mark, who is black, actually said (this made me chuckle a little) "i'm lucky, if it was just me with the gun they woulda shot me cause i'm black". i've actually never been so scared in my life, but at least my mom was calm, dad wasn't.

    Here is the summary: I had a new airsoft smg and a pistol and wanted to use it at my friend's house.

    Here is the article: begins with the obligatory tifu 'this actually happened three years ago'

i was off to my friend's house for the first time, and i didn't quite know where he lived. i didn't have my phone/any internet on me, so i was just relying on remembering the name of his flat/block thing. i was searching for his house for a while, so i ended up being fairly late, but i eventually found it, and it also turned out my mates went out the house searching for me since i was so late (keep in mind, no phone). so i walk up to the buzzers, really happy i found the house, and i begin mashing his door buzzer, but no one answers. i continue mashing, but i must have pressed the wrong button, and out of frustration for waiting outside for so long, after the person in the little speaker answered, i shouted 'open the frickin door', only to find a frustrated father come to the front of the flat, open the door, only to find me apologising for pressing the wrong button and telling him it was an accident. he lets me in, and the first sight i was greeted with was the entire family peeking out of their front door with concerned faces watch me go by and up the stairs.

final kick in the face, i knocked on my friends door, only to find out he isn't home, because he was out looking for me, so i end up awkwardly leaving the flat, only to see my friends shouting at me from across the road as i walk home

    Here is the summary: pressed the wrong buzzer, made a threatening sounding call, made an entire family give me dirty looks**

    Here is the article: so i picked up this second job delivering pies for mazzios. i have never worked in the restaurant industry or food delivery service. it's my second day towards the end of my shift when we get a delivery for a customer out in the boondocks (i'm from oklahoma). i grab the ticket and head out the door. as soon as i arrive the customer is at the door waiting on me. he immediately spout something along the lines "took ye lon nuff" i don't speak whatever language that was and immediately it was awkward. he paid via credit card which surprised me because this creature in front of me couldn't even comprehend something called drive time. so i proceed to give him his food and hand him his copy of the receipt. i pull out a pen for him to sign with and as you can guess his hands are a little full. so he hands me back the pizza as he signs and gives me back the pen. i say thank you and turn back to my car when i felt something was off. i was walking off with his pizza. i felt like the biggest dumbass in the world until i went back to the door to give the man his pie back and he wouldn't answer. that's when i looked at the receipt and notice he didn't leave a tip. he was assuming i was mad about getting skimped out on. all is well as i devoured it on my way home and lunch the next day.
 
edit/update: not fired. confessed to manager and she laughed. thanks for the guilt trip guys.

    Here is the article: i had some friends over last night and we, being 17, got to the point at 11 o'clock where anything stupid is fun. so we settled on wagoning. i have this huge offroad wagon with air filled tires and a handle in the front to steer it. my neighborhood is hilly, so we spent the night trying to get the highest top speed (measured by an accelerometer app). we started out on smaller hills, eventually working up to this huge paved mountain pretty far from my house. up until this point our highest speed was 24 mph. that was on a damn big hill too. this hill, the big one, was a landmark in my neighborhood. i don't feel safe going down it in a car. once my friends saw it though, they were set. it was the only way to break our previous speed.

so 3 of us, including me, climbed to about the top (yes 3 fucking people fit on this tank). we put on gloves, pushed off down the hill. the only sound was whistling wind. i had a phone, screenshotting every higher number that appeared. we got to 33 mph, and barely made it around the turn at the bottom of the hill by leaning out of the wagon. 

but our hunger for speed was insatiable. i wanted to sit the next one out, so one of my friends took my place and the other 2 went again. they idiotically decided to go higher up on the hill. one other friend and i were waiting at the bottom. after a long 3 minutes, we saw the wagon's silhouette soaring down under the streetlights.it looked like a normal run at first. then we heard frank, our pilot, scream "i can't steer". when they get to the bend, they go straight into the neighbor's yard and collide with a fire hydrant. 

the next scene looked like a michael bay movie. nick (back seat) realized he was the last air bender and launched almost 20 feet across the yard, tearing up the grass where his feet hit. brian (middle) flew straight into the air, flipped over, and landed on his back on the wagon. he can't remember the crash, but he had a helmet on. frank (pilot) still had his hand on the steering handle when it hit, and took the majority of the force there, rolling off to the the left after. 

the last speed brian had seen on his phone was 40 mph. he and nick got off ok, with bruised legs and sprained ankles. frank's hand turned into a balloon. it swelled to where he couldn't move it. also, the skin was ripped off of his knuckles, right through his fucking gloves. 

we stumbled home to my very protective dad sitting on the couch waiting for me. we were supposed to be in the basement by 10:30 to watch a movie or play melee or something. i panicked and told him no one got hurt. i snuck frank some otc pain pills and got neosporin for cuts. parents still don't know. updates or pictures can come if anyone cares.

    Output format: PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE

    Evaluation Criteria:
    1. Read the news article carefully and identify the main topic and key points.
    2. Read the summary and compare it to the news article. Check if the summary covers the main topic and key points of the news article, and if it resents them in a clear and logical order.
    3. Rate the summary with 5 percentages, where each one represents how likely the summary is going to get a score from 1 to 5. For example, if you think the summary is 80% likely to get a score of 5, 10% likely to get a score of 4, 5% likely to get a score of 3, 3% likely to get a score of 2, and 1% likely to get a score of 1, you should rate the summary as 80, 10, 5, 3, 2.

    Here is the article: i had some friends over last night and we, being 17, got to the point at 11 o'clock where anything stupid is fun. so we settled on wagoning. i have this huge offroad wagon with air filled tires and a handle in the front to steer it. my neighborhood is hilly, so we spent the night trying to get the highest top speed (measured by an accelerometer app). we started out on smaller hills, eventually working up to this huge paved mountain pretty far from my house. up until this point our highest speed was 24 mph. that was on a damn big hill too. this hill, the big one, was a landmark in my neighborhood. i don't feel safe going down it in a car. once my friends saw it though, they were set. it was the only way to break our previous speed.

so 3 of us, including me, climbed to about the top (yes 3 fucking people fit on this tank). we put on gloves, pushed off down the hill. the only sound was whistling wind. i had a phone, screenshotting every higher number that appeared. we got to 33 mph, and barely made it around the turn at the bottom of the hill by leaning out of the wagon. 

but our hunger for speed was insatiable. i wanted to sit the next one out, so one of my friends took my place and the other 2 went again. they idiotically decided to go higher up on the hill. one other friend and i were waiting at the bottom. after a long 3 minutes, we saw the wagon's silhouette soaring down under the streetlights.it looked like a normal run at first. then we heard frank, our pilot, scream "i can't steer". when they get to the bend, they go straight into the neighbor's yard and collide with a fire hydrant. 

the next scene looked like a michael bay movie. nick (back seat) realized he was the last air bender and launched almost 20 feet across the yard, tearing up the grass where his feet hit. brian (middle) flew straight into the air, flipped over, and landed on his back on the wagon. he can't remember the crash, but he had a helmet on. frank (pilot) still had his hand on the steering handle when it hit, and took the majority of the force there, rolling off to the the left after.

    Here is the article: so this happened a couple nights ago...

my girlfriend suffers from a pretty serious medical condition that she keeps managed through various medications. recently she had a complication that will most likely require surgery to fix and she now is taking vicodin to manage the pain.

so the other night she had forgotten she'd taken her vicodin (and hadn't told me when she had either) and was in a lot of pain. she goes into the liquor cabinet and finds a schnapps that i keep around. she asks if she can drink a little bit of it to help relax the muscles around her stomach to which i say "of course" without realizing she had taken her vicodin.

over the next couple hours she proceeded to drink a bit more than a  "little," and got a  little drunk. she got very frisky and hyper and eventually ended up stealing my phone and texting a friend of mine for about an hour.

through her incessant laughter she says to me that "the last time [she] was this drunk [she] was drugged." i couldn't quite make it out and thought she was joking, so i replied with a chuckle.

next thing i know she has her hands over her face and has stopped moving. i don't hear any more giggling or any sound for that matter. so i go to check on her and she has crumbled into tears. she tells me about a traumatic event in college where she was date-raped. she had apparently repressed the memory and i spent the next two hours consoling her and trying to get her to think about anything else.

    Here is the summary: i laughed at what i thought was a joke from my drunk gf and ended up bringing up a repressed traumatic memory.

    Here is the article: this happened about 2 or 3 months ago, a week or two before school had started.

me and my step-brother were at our school for a voluntary day where juniors and seniors (we're in highschool) could come and pay off book fees, get new books, possibly return old books, and get new campus id's. there was a long line of students ending in front some tables, occupied by teachers, where these procedures occurred. the whole thing was being held in the cafeteria. 

me and my step-brother were talking with some friends we had found, waiting patiently in line and generally enjoying the pre-school social interaction when my step-mom (his actual mother) sent me a text.

*do you have your latin book with you?*

i had taken latin the year before, and had a textbook that i got, but was supposed to return that day. surprisingly, i had remembered to bring the book with me, and decided that the best way to let her know i had it was to just send a picture of it. but, just a picture was boring, i thought to myself. i decided that a selfie would be much more casual and fun. so, i open up my camera, hold my phone up in position to where you can see me and the book, and prepare to take the picture. my step-brother sees that i'm about to take this selfie and poses behind me, so i turn the camera a bit to where you can see him, and take the picture. i look at the image and make sure the book is clearly distinguishable, and, being satisfied, promptly send the picture to my step-mom.

now this is where the fu happens.

i show my step-brother the picture i just sent and say something along the lines of "she wanted to know if i had my book," and smile to myself.

my step-brother's face turns white immediately, like he'd just seen a ghost. come to think of it now, he probably saw his own ghost.

he was flipping the bird directly at the camera when i had taken that picture. the picture i just sent to his mom. i don't know how i hadn't noticed it. he was right there, very visible, making a crude and suggestive hand gesture. 

he just looks at me and says something like *"what the fuck?"* we both thought he was going to be grounded, right then and there. 

i quickly follow up with another text to his mom, saying "umm... oops," hoping to get her to realize it was a mistake. 

a couple of awkward minutes between me and my step-brother later, his mom texts back "jackasses." she ended up finding it pretty funny and didn't mention when we got home later that day.

 

edit: i just want to say that me and my step-brother are pretty close, we're basically real siblings. his mom and her two kids, my step-brother brother included, have been living with my dad and my siblings for quite a while now, and she's basically like a second mother. the only reason i used such formal and proper words to describe them is for better understanding, irl i don't refer to either of them as "my step-brother's mother" or "my step-brother."

    Here is the summary: sent a picture of me and my step-brother, with him obviously flipping the bird, to his mother.

    Here is the article: alright... this is a very weird story so sit back and get ready...
ok.. i am a senior now at a pretty big high school.  almost everyday after school my friends and i stay after to play basketball or dodgeball in the gym.. like literally 4/5 days of the week.  when we were freshmen, there was a whole extra room that wasnt being used that had wooden lockers in it. being stupid we decided to put our lunch bags in there and bring our school bags with us to the gym.  so the day went on as normal and we carried out the rest of our day. we wound up leaving our lunches in the locker (with full meals in them), and went home. only to forget about them...

flash foward 3 years ---
i just got home from school a couple hours ago and i cannot stop laughing.  it was something like two weeks after we left our lunches they closed down the room to repaint the lockers and the walls in the spare room where we kept our lunch bags.  since this was in the freshman lockers area we never went back and just expected someone else to throw them out. as to our knowledge, the lockers and walls were repainted within a couple days and nothing happened... wrong!

being as the lockers are made of wood all around it turns out that a lot of rats and other rodents made their way through the walls and the surrounding lockers. when the custodian opened the all the lockers and left them open overnight, i guess the rats were tired of being locked up all these years.  so we come into school this morning and there are literally hundreds of rats everywhere! running around the school and everything! the school had to evacuated and everyone went home today! 
there was rat "business" everywhere and all the floors are messed up.

    Here is the summary: my idiot friends and i left our lunches in wooden lockers as freshmen, left them there for years, and now we're seniors and there are rats everywhere in our school.

    Here is the article: alright... this is a very weird story so sit back and get ready...
ok.. i am a senior now at a pretty big high school.  almost everyday after school my friends and i stay after to play basketball or dodgeball in the gym.. like literally 4/5 days of the week.  when we were freshmen, there was a whole extra room that wasnt being used that had wooden lockers in it. being stupid we decided to put our lunch bags in there and bring our school bags with us to the gym.  so the day went on as normal and we carried out the rest of our day. we wound up leaving our lunches in the locker (with full meals in them), and went home. only to forget about them...

flash foward 3 years ---
i just got home from school a couple hours ago and i cannot stop laughing.  it was something like two weeks after we left our lunches they closed down the room to repaint the lockers and the walls in the spare room where we kept our lunch bags.  since this was in the freshman lockers area we never went back and just expected someone else to throw them out. as to our knowledge, the lockers and walls were repainted within a couple days and nothing happened... wrong!

being as the lockers are made of wood all around it turns out that a lot of rats and other rodents made their way through the walls and the surrounding lockers. when the custodian opened the all the lockers and left them open overnight, i guess the rats were tired of being locked up all these years.  so we come into school this morning and there are literally hundreds of rats everywhere! running around the school and everything! the school had to evacuated and everyone went home today! 
there was rat "business" everywhere and all the floors are messed up.

    Here is the summary: The lockers and walls in the spare room where we kept our lunch bags were repainted within a couple days.

    Here is the article: i still can't get over this from earlier today.

i share a common area with four guys. it's winter break and two of them aren't here, the roommate by mine graduated and his room is empty. for whatever reason, i think "hmm i'm bored. i've only jerked the jerk twice today, might as well do it again." but i want to switch things up a bit, and i see this empty room calling my name. hell yes. i set up my laptop, and blow a load all over the mattress. judge me, idc. most of us have wanked in places purely to say to ourselves and strangers on the internet that we have. this was mine.


so there's this guy, right. and he is awkward af and doesn't really understand things like "hey man i'm tired" or "oh i would but i have homework to do." whatever, it's unimportant. what is important is that he came over about an hour later. he wants to show me some random thing about argentina's gov't on youtube. 


"haha yea okay man, let me just get my laptop. i've been using [roommates] room since he left."

sure enough we've arrived at the scene of the crime and there was the longest half a second pause between us. i'm usually really good at talking myself out of situations. this time, with my long stream of still mostly wet and gelatinous goo settling nicely right next to my open (but thankfully turned off) laptop, i could think of nothing to say.

him-"oh-uh-er what's that?"

me-"oh what the fuck [roommate]?!? i guess he let one loose before he left"

keeping in mind we both know he's been gone for a month, and my laptop is four inches from my load. 

me-"ahahaha oh man that's so gross hahaha what a weirdo but hey that's not too weird everyone does it ahahahaa" 

i think what was freaking me out most is that we were both *so close* to my jizz. i mean we were essentially breathing on it. i grab my laptop and say "ahahaha hey you said something about argentinean rebels??" 

but wait there is more. maintenance and our da (a woman) come to inspect the room and make sure everything is okay for the new roommate to move in. jesus freaking lord. whatever, i figured i could feign innocence this time around more confidently. as it turns out i didn't even need to. i hear this awkward conversation ensue:

"uh, what is that?"

"uuuuhhhh"

"is that...?"

"could be *slight chuckle*" 

"uh okay let's just flip the mattress over, i don't want to touch that."

sure enough as they were leaving my voice begins to crack and gives me away. we're all practically yelling at each other, hoping to block out our own thoughts of what has occurred i'm sure. 

"okay young man have a good one"

"haha hey yea y'all stay safe in the snow, have a good one"


they leave, i try every excuse in the book to get this other guy out of my dorm, and as soon as he leaves i rub one out just to calm down a bit.

    Here is the article: so it all begins with this lone fact - i have a large bladder, and can normally hold in my piss for hours, and piss, no joke, about a gallon. it starts in 5th period, i am going about my business and i have the urge to pee. knowing i can hold it for the few hours until i get out, i opt to hold it. i proceed to math class, and we have a test today. i begin my test and start going through it. i feel like i need to pee soon, and decide i'll do it after i finish my test. nope. i start sweating like i've been running for the past hour, and go up to ask the teacher if i can go to the bathroom. the hall pass is already out, shit. i sit back at my desk and wait. naturally being in this situation, i have the squeakiest chair in the whole fucking class. i begin fidgeting like a motherfucker, about to lose it. feel a squirt. feel a river. shit, *i just pissed my shorts...* it took that fucker seven minutes from when i counted to fucking come back... great. teacher's like "flipping_fish, the pass is back" - i'm sitting in my piss drenched shorts and have two problems to finish... i quickly finish them, take the pass, and thank god i wear black clothing. i finish my piss, strip down in the public school restroom in the disabled bathroom (the large wheelchair one) and wash the hell out of them. dryed with paper towels... paper towels run out. fuck. proceed to put on my clothing and casually walk out, and two guys are waiting to use the thing. now i have to wait inside my classroom for 45 minutes sitting in my own piss and thank god i didn't leak onto the floor. but then, i walk out to my mothers car - she wants me to drive. she has towels over all the seats *thank god*, but she needed me to drive her places... i ended up sitting, in my own pissed shorts, for 4 hours. fml - tifu

For example, if you think the summary is 80% likely to get a score of 5, 10% likely to get a score of 4, 5% likely to get a score of 3, 3% likely to get a score of 2, and 1% likely to get a score of 1, you should rate the summary as 80, 10, 5, 3, 2.

    Here is the article: no throwaway cuz fuck it. i woke up earlier than usual today, 8:00 instead of 8:30, so i had some time before i had to go to class. ofc being the horny college student i am, i decided to have some fun by pleasuring myself. now both of my roommates were gone at the time, one was sleeping at friends dorm, and the other was having breakfast, which he usually eats at around 7:45 and comes back about 45 minutes later, so i decide i can do a quickie. i usually do this in the bathroom, but the one that i use was occupied by my suite-mates (people that share a common bathroom that only 2 rooms can share.) so i go on my computer, grab my tissues and search the usual and whatnot. about halfway through starting, around 8:15, i'm getting close to climaxing, and i hear the click of my door unlocking. *holy shit* i try to pull up my pants, but by then he's already seen me and everything. so i pull up my pants, tissues still in there and casually go back to doing other things. we can still talk, but theres definitely an air of awkwardness between us.

    Here is the summary: I woke up earlier than usual today, 8:00 instead of 8:30, so i had some time before i had to go to class.

    Here is the article: i was a 12 year old boy and was playing at my friend's house who lived on an orchard. star wars episode 1 just came out so we were obsessed, dressing like the characters and having plastic light saber fights on the trampoline. we started recording ourselves with a video camera chasing each other through the fields and jumping over the ditches and canals that water irrigated through. i was pretending to be darth maul and the only black shirt i could find was a netted fabric raiders football t-shirt. my friend started recording me when i went to jump over a canal, but the surrounding trees were providing so much shade that i was unaware of the 3 rows of barbed wire suspended across the middle of my obstacle. i crashed into the barbed wires with all of my limbs spread out like a flying squirrel and the barbs that ended up making contact with my body started at my lower abdomen and sliced me all the way up my torso. and the barbs were spread out about one foot apart on the wire, which just so happened to be the exact same distance between my nipples. the 2 cuts were about 2 and a half feet long each spanning the entire front side of my body and miraculously split both of my nipples in half! then to top it all off, i was left hanging there in mid-air just suspended by the netted fabric of my shirt that was caught in the barbed wire. my friend's mom helped me clean up while i cried the whole time, then i went to the hospital to get a bunch of tetanus shots... ...good times!  the best part is that in some closet wherever that friend lives now is a film of this incident! lol
 

update: i will post pics of the scars on my nips if anyone persists!  lol

    Here is the article: so this happened minutes ago...i'm now hiding in my office, avoiding the lunch room and praying for home time!

i've recently started a keto diet and read up on the benefits of mct oil as part of the diet. (an easy way to get fat into your system via bulletproof coffee or similar)

one of the many possible side effects is of course diarrhoea...

well, 4 days into drinking this stuff i'm thinking screw you side effects, i'm clearly a machine!

15 minutes ago i felt the urge to fart...having my own room this isn't an issue regardless of noise disturbance so i work away...only...it wasn't a fart...it was a full on nappy filling shart...

panic stations...the closest toilet to me is being cleaned...i have to waddle down to the shared bathroom and thank god its empty!

my underwear can't be saved...worse still my trousers aren't looking the prettiest...all i can say is i'm lucky my favourite colour is blue..

i cleaned up as best i could...hide the underwear in an empty sweet box from christmas (please let me remember to bring that home) and headed to the now clean upstairs toilet to dry everything off...

baby wipes are in short supply at work so screen wipes to the rescue....i'm now hoping i can sit at my desk for the rest of the afternoon until i can sneak off home!!

    Here is the article: this happened last weekend, but bear with me. to give you some background, i am a collegiate wrestler. we travel a lot for duals and tournaments, frequently getting to our destination the night before the event and staying in a hotel. we try to save money by having sleeping partners, partners that we get to select. now just about every team has that one kid who is extremely weird and no one wants to associate with. ours, let's call him jay, didn't have a roommate, so i, trying to be nice after feeling some pity for him, i invited him to room with my other two roommates (and very close friends). they always share a bed, leaving me and jay to share the other. 
we checked in pretty late and had to get up rather early the next morning so i decided it would be a good idea for us all to go to sleep asap, and everyone agreed, though this was partly to get out of needing to engage in any further conversation with jay. now it gets really interesting.
i awake in the middle of the night to a voice. i'm not sure what time it is, but i quickly realize that it is jay right beside me talking on the phone. out of curiosity of who this kid could be talking to, i began listening closely to his conversation while faking asleep, and it got really weird really quick.
jay began talking dirty to whoever was on the line with him (presumably his girlfriend) right next to me. i didn't want to say anything because that would be the most awkward confrontation in the world, and i do not do well with confrontations. 
he was keeping his voice fairly hushed to not wake anybody, but i could hear him pretty clearly as i was maybe half a foot away from this pervert. after a minute or so of dirty talking, i hear the  voice on the other end of the line say something along the lines of "you should rub it." 
my heart stopped. 
there's no way. 
he'd at least go to the bathroom to do it, right?
nope, this fucking disgusting excuse for a human being began pounding his rotten meat-sledge right beside me in bed. once i heard the first soft "clap, clap, clap," i jumped up and began flipping shit. i went off on this kid, waking the other roommates who then proceeded to give him an earful as well. we decided not to tell anyone else on the team about this, but man we really chewed him out. still debating whether or not to tell my coaches though... i guess this is what i get for being nice to the weird kid.

    Here is the summary: i tried to be nice to the weird kid on my team by letting him room with me and my friends, he ended up pounding off in bed next to me in the middle of the night.

    Here is the article: like many of these posts, this happened a few years back.

i used to work at an animal hospital, and one day an owner came to pick up their chihuahua.  and their chihuahua wasn't one of the cute, dopey ones like [this lil bongo playin' ese.](http://i.imgur.com/wdjk4jq.gif) no, this one was one of those [evil little fuckers](http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view4/4709801/evil-chihuahua-o.gif) that you wish you could punt.  after looking in the cage and seeing the evil emanating from the dog, i come back out of the kennels to grab the necessary tools to capture this dog unscathed.  another kennel tech, a former marine, sees me equipping for battle and comes to my aid.  we both kneel before the cage and attempt to carefully extract the dog.

enter muffin.

muffin was a boarding pitbull, quite jovial and sweet.  but she was ripped.  we've all seen [this dog](http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a335/bzboardco/2192-640.jpg) before, and that was the kind of body she had, with a big ol' pitbull head that made her look more proportional.  muffin's cage was right across the hall, and [her mouth must've been watering](https://33.media.tumblr.com/02b25fd7ea576736c0d047f3176804c0/tumblr_mos4dglsde1suw0poo1_250.gif) over her bite-size neighbor for days.  my fellow kennel tech and i were focused on the chihuahua, hugging the corner of her kennel while snarling and snapping.  the cage was wide open, and the entire kennel was going wild, so neither of us knew that muffin was [biding her time](https://33.media.tumblr.com/08ac97386f9b26e6efa4af47de983dcd/tumblr_n6ijxnaypb1s0lpkco1_500.gif), waiting for the perfect moment to strike.

we also didn't know the lock on her cage was broken.

muffin burst out of her cage and there was suddenly a massive gray head between us chomping after the chihuahua.  my coworker, the marine, reacted quickly under pressure and yanked the chihuahua from the cage.  the chihuahua was not very grateful and attempted to bite him, so he naturally let go of the dog and held it only by the leash.

me, i'm frozen, watching the chaos in horror.  the chihuahua is making strangled squawk noises as it hangs from the leash, spinning like a disco ball.  muffin is [leaping beneath her](http://i.giflike.com/rpnyxp7.gif) like the goddamn crocodile from peter pan, her teeth clicking every time she misses.  i finally come to my senses and grab her by the collar and throw her back in the cage, ensuring the door was indeed shut this time and [thwarting her dinner plans](http://i.giflike.com/jrvooot.gif).

i carefully take the still-dangling chihuahua into my arms, wrapping her in a blanket.  she was far more grateful that time, snuggly even.  we returned her to her owner, not speaking a word about how her precious baby was almost eaten.

    Here is the summary: : mean chihuahua gets her just desserts thanks to muffin the pitbull almost eating her.  and my negligence.  but everything's okay, yaayyyy

    Here is the article: like many of these posts, this happened a few years back.

i used to work at an animal hospital, and one day an owner came to pick up their chihuahua.  and their chihuahua wasn't one of the cute, dopey ones like [this lil bongo playin' ese.](http://i.imgur.com/wdjk4jq.gif) no, this one was one of those [evil little fuckers](http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view4/4709801/evil-chihuahua-o.gif) that you wish you could punt.  after looking in the cage and seeing the evil emanating from the dog, i come back out of the kennels to grab the necessary tools to capture this dog unscathed.  another kennel tech, a former marine, sees me equipping for battle and comes to my aid.  we both kneel before the cage and attempt to carefully extract the dog.

enter muffin.

muffin was a boarding pitbull, quite jovial and sweet.  but she was ripped.  we've all seen [this dog](http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a335/bzboardco/2192-640.jpg) before, and that was the kind of body she had, with a big ol' pitbull head that made her look more proportional.  muffin's cage was right across the hall, and [her mouth must've been watering](https://33.media.tumblr.com/02b25fd7ea576736c0d047f3176804c0/tumblr_mos4dglsde1suw0poo1_250.gif) over her bite-size neighbor for days.  my fellow kennel tech and i were focused on the chihuahua, hugging the corner of her kennel while snarling and snapping.  the cage was wide open, and the entire kennel was going wild, so neither of us knew that muffin was [biding her time](https://33.media.tumblr.com/08ac97386f9b26e6efa4af47de983dcd/tumblr_n6ijxnaypb1s0lpkco1_500.gif), waiting for the perfect moment to strike.

    Here is the article: one part of this story happened today, the other has been developing during the last twenty years. 

today was not a good day. i had a crappy day at work, then i had the highlight of my day, having lunch with my so which is always nice, and after that i went to the ophthalmologist to what was supposed to be my last appointment for a while. turned out that he had to put an eyepatch to help my eye recover faster from a corneal ulcer that developed after i used therapeutic contact lenses because i had keratitis punctata -i wish i was making this shit up-, so... i have to wear this thing for 24h. 

i came to my house, angry and annoyed because of the eyepatch, and as i was looking for something i desperately need for work, and after i searched inside my closet without any luck, i closed the closet door a bit too harsh, and of course, karma kicked in. the closet door hit a shampoo bottle i had in there, the bottle cap opened and the content spread all over the closet floor. 

sounds messy but not like a big deal, right? well, wrong. 

because i was born in one of the worst countries to be living in right now, and i actually still live here because i don't have enough $ to buy a plane ticket, i had to spend a whole hour picking up the spilled shampoo to put it back in the bottle, because i can not afford to buy a new one since there's none to be found in this country, unless you're lucky and get into a 5 to 10 hour line, or you buy it at a ridiculous high price in the black market.

and, because that wasn't enough, i tried to close one of the drawers of my nightstand and the thing broke.

so much for living in a so-called paradise.

    Here is the summary: i was born in the wrong country, years later i can't buy shampoo, i have an eyepatch and a broken drawer.

    Here is the article: this did not happen today, rather two weeks ago. 

i am 18, currently dating a 16 year old (it's legal; 18 months age gap is legal in australia) who has been a victim of child abuse, at the hands of her parents for a while. her parents, who shan't be named, are very well known, particularly her mother, in their respective countries of origin, having competed in previous olympic games and bringing home medals. 

my girlfriend had a breakdown one night, and proceeded to self-harm. i talked to her as much as i could, and wanted to go and pick her up, but didn't for fear of legal actions. the next day she came to see me, and refused to return home when her mother demanded she did. she was simply more comfortable, more safe in my home, and my arms, than her parents. and so her mother decided she would come to my house and take her daughter home. after yelling at her daughter through the phone, she hung up as she began driving to my home. i proceeded to call her, and essentially yell at this woman through the phone.

she threatened to call the police. to which i responded that she would be more than welcome too, and that i would take her to court on charges of trespassing, potentially breaking and entering, assault and child abuse.

she hung up, and continued on her merry way. and so i called the police myself. when she arrived, she was shocked to find that i had called the police, as she hadn't done it herself (nice empty threats you've got there). after a brief argument, she left to talk the police as i had, who told her everything that i already knew, as i had researched it previously: her 16 year old daughter was legally capable of choosing where she wanted to live, and she couldn't do a thing about it. she returned, infuriated but acting calm, before leaving without her daughter.

a week later, her daughter returned home, to see how her parents were, and to assess the situation. the saying of my name now results in eye rolls, groans, and moments of severe hate.

    Here is the summary: called the police on my girlfriend's mother, a world famous athlete. both parents now hate me.

    Here is the article: this tifu is happening right now. i have a cold. yesterday i bought some over the counter cold and flu medication, the combo pack with daytime and nighttime pills. i was in a rush to get to work and in my haste, i popped 2 white pills (there were blue pills and white pills... blue must be nighttime, right?). so i get to work on time and everything is going fine. about an hour into my shift i start feeling.... weird. dizzy, drowsy, uncoordinated and confused. i have no idea why i'm feeling like this. it starts to worsen and i'm worried i'm going to pass out because my eyes are so heavy, i can barely keep them open and i'm feeling warm and fuzzy. this is when i realize what i had done. i stagger my way into the back room at work and read the pill box. i definitely took the white nighttime pills. after googling diphenhydramine hydrochloride my fear had been confirmed. 
only 7 hrs left of my shift.

    Here is the summary: I took 2 white pills, thinking they were daytime pills.

    Here is the article: i recently got hired in for a job, which i am really happy about. sadly, their orientation class(es) has wonky hours, requiring me to get up early so i have time to get ready and get up there. i managed to doze off last night early for 40 mins, then woke back up and decided to watch youtube in bed after taking a sleep aide. after feeling it kick in i try to sleep. a short amount of time passes before i remember reading that if you can't get to sleep in 20 mins, get back up. so i did. then i realized it was already 11pm and i had to be up at 5am. so i'm not sure what to do. i end up talking to my girlfriend over facebook and stupidly bring up a topic that makes me stressed. (that's a story in and of itself really). finally i was able to calm down enough and ended up falling asleep at 2:30am. i got up at 5am as usual, and thinking a shower would help, go take one. normally i have a lot of trouble sleeping and can barely sleep in a bed, let alone in any other weird situation. i was nearly nodding off in the shower. got out and couldn't hold my head up. deciding this was too dangerous to drive under, i called the number on my work papers and left a message. i tried to wait to see if they would call me when they opened. after slamming my face on the keyboard from failure to hold my head up. i called it quits and went to sleep. stupidly i should've taken my phone so it would wake me if they called. i slept til near 1pm. got up and saw they returned my call. my voicemail was from the training woman who had not received my message. this is the moment i found out if i had taken my phone into my bedroom, i could've still come in. the voice mail said i could still show up within an hour or so.  cue me trying to call back. at 3:45pm i finally get an answer and get told the class is full and now they have to roll me back to the start date of december 30. i've already been stuck at home with nothing to do for weeks, now that's going to be extended, all because my sorry ass cannot get to sleep when i need to.

    Here is the summary: job start date got pushed back 2 weeks because i couldn't sleep. stuck at home with nothing to do until then.

the dream world quickly takes over, and i'm texting girls in my sleep, because that's apparently what my mind wants.  a few text messages later, i realize that i wasn't entirely messaging girls in my sleep, but i responded to my sister with, "you're bad babe."  tomorrow should be awkward.

    Here is the article: i usually avoid changing in gym locker rooms. it's not a body image thing, i just don't usually have any time constraints or motivations that would require anything other than waiting until i got home to shower and change.

today, though, i got lazy and decided to just change there. i didn't feel like putting a towel down on the car seat, okay? 

so i chose the farthest set of lockers because it was deserted (because the last thing you want to do is have to sidle past a fellow athlete and have jingles be jangled and what not) and i disrobed, showered, and got back to my locker promptly, towel wrapped around my waist.

so as i returned to my locker, a group of 6-8 year olds followed by one supervising adult came into my locker nook right behind me, because apparently that is where they had set up shop before their pool trip. the adult received a phone call and wandered over to the sinks, partially out of sight. the kids ripped off their swimsuits in exchange for their birthday suits and started cartwheeling around the u shaped locker nook. i tried to ignore them as i opened my locker and organized my belongings. but i heard them murmuring behind me.

"heheheh, i can see your wee wee!"
"ha! i can see your wee wee!"
*giggles*
they were being kids, sure, but it was a creepy conversation to be privy to as it is. but it got weird when the turned their attention to me.

"can ya see the big person's wee wee?"
"i don't know, i don't, i don't think so"

this was making me even more uncomfortable. then one of them snuck up behind me and ripped off my towel. the bugger absconded with my towel and started doing his best hare krishna impression. 

but i ignored them because no way was i going to chase children around until i at least had my shorts on. but i couldn't find them. they were buried somewhere in my locker and i cursed my lack of organization in putting them away. they continued murmuring.

"gasp! they look like ... potatoes!"
"big potatoes!"

forget uncomfortable. it was like 9th grade all over again. i'd have preferred a swirly. even a chunky dunk. especially after the last kid spoke up.

"... heheh mashed potatoes!!!! ahahahahahah!!!!"

and the smallest one (still buck naked, mind you), got on the bench and charged at me, leaping in the air towards me. considering he just implied he was gonna do some serious damage to my potatoes, i felt like i had no choice but to catch him and hold him as far away from my potatoes as possible. he started thrashing around like i was playing a game of sega human fishing, and i tried my best to hold him as far from me as possible. the other kids, in various forms of undress, kept giggling, pointing at my kibbles and bits.

it was awful.

this is, of course, when their adult comes back around and finds me butt naked, holding one of his children, the rest of them gathered around me. the one in my hands squirms out of my grasp and runs towards the guy. the guy just mouths a sorry and corrals them together towards the showers. 

i just stood there. ashamed. broken. 

i found my boxers rolled up in my work shoes. 


 

edit: dang it, i'm on the front page. i guess i should be thankful. thank you, ladies ad gents, for making my potatoes famous. good health to all of you!

    Here is the summary: me and my potatoes are never coming back to the gym again, especially if i can't get a restraining order on children.

    Here is the article: i took a sleeping pill, and those make me the weirdest kind of horny. i was stimulating my clit, and i really wanted to try to get a g-spot orgasm. i grab a nearby sharpie and started pushing it against my g-spot. it felt so good, so i started doing that and rubbing my clit simultaneously for double feel good. i was soaking wet. i came quite intensely. i pull out the highlighter and it drips on my face. *aw yeah my vaginal cum is so hot on my face*. remember, sleeping pills make people weird. then i turn on the light to see how much i squirted. 

it was blood. 

it was all blood and cum. 

my hands and face were covered in blood, the sharpie is producing a murky brown color, and there was even blood splatter on the walls. i guess i got my period. whoops. 

the worst part is that i got period blood on my dead grandmother's quilt. i sleep with it every night, so that's why it was there in the first place. 

 

edit: i got the stain out. you guys sure know a lot about blood stain removal, you psychopaths.

    Here is the article: so i stayed at my grandmother's house for thanksgiving this year. and we tend to drink a lot in my family. so naturally i have been drunk for a solid 3 days. today was a beer drunkered  kinda day. especially because we had a back up of septic tank issues after morning showers.
after finishing several arrogant bastards and looking at sexy wall papers for my phone, the urge hit me like a wall.

so i go to the bathroom around midnight to rub one off. i make it quick due to the family in the house. i always turn the faucet on to reduce noise while doing the hand solo dirty business. 
as i cum everywhere i realized my feet were wet, but not from baby making juice. i then see water flowing like niagara falls from under the sink. turns out the sink has been disconnected for years. there was literally no piping so water just flowed straight onto the floor.

as i am two towels into cleaning my mess, my uncle walks in. he was so confused and just said, "this is why i don't like people using my bathroom."
thank god he didn't walk in five minutes earlier.

but at least the floor mats are now getting my cum washed off them.
but today was a day i learned just how stressful plumbing can be.

    Here is the summary: i came all over the floor while i flooded my grandmother's bathroom, just minutes before my uncle discovered me cleaning up my mess.

    Here is the article: this happened last weekend, didnt get back to home before the week day rules went into affect, so here it is

i knew she was a virgin at the time, and never really looked for anything more than casual friendship and talking from time to time when i visited home, where she lived. but last week, she started texting me, and uncharacteristically was getting getting quite flirty, to the point of straight up sexting. long story short, we agreed that i could come over to her place in a week (yesterday) while her parents were hosting a party for some relatives, and we could sneak away for some nsfw fun. 

to the fuck up, yesterday comes along, and i arrive at her place around 8:30pm, the party had been going on since 4 in the afternoon, and the majority of her relatives were smashed at this point. so doing as most teenage guys would do, i begin to play catch up. and that was a fucking mistake! 
my casual alcohol of choice has always been dark beers, great for sipping over a long course of time, not too drunk, easy to stomach, not so easy to chug back 6 in two hours.

i'm a little tipsy, shes a little tipsy, and after introducing me to her family, including mom and dad! it's off to her room for some sexy times. beginning with some making out, things progress in a timely manner to the point that i'm tongue deep in her pussy (#gentlemengodownfirst), but it had been quite a hot day, and sweating tends to build up down there. buuuut! its fine, i do my duty and lubricate her well for the eventual deed. 

i lose my pants and bring out the little guy, aaaaannnnd whiskey dick. great! buuuut! its fine, i'm endowed enough to work with this! after struggling to penetrate her virgin pussy, it finally goes in. shes loving it, no blood, wet as a water slide, its a good time. 
and onto the climax of the fuck up (pun intended)! im getting into a rhythm on top of her, doing her slowly, than faster, than slow again, trying my best to make her first time as enjoyable as possible. unfortunately, my liquor filled stomach was not so in favour of this... 

the constant motion of rocking in a out, results in some motion sickness, and as i feel it begin to well, i jump off of her and head for the door! unable to make it, i vomit profusely onto her carpet and door... fucking fantastic! fun times quickly end, as i grab my boxers and run for the bathroom before throwing up again. i come back to a fully dressed, stressed out half-virgin, telling me everything's fine. everything is not fine.
 
so we go out to the party and she gets her mom to help her clean the mess, as i'm left with her dad, trying to hide my shame to the man i just met, whose daughter i just deflowered, whose room i just covered in alcoholic spew. half way through said conversation, i quickly run to the outdoor loo to throw up three more times. 

i crashed on a couch that night, not before several awkward conversations with a couple siblings, and her parents. luckily her mom was pretty cool about it. probably wouldn't have been had she known what we were doing...

i sneaked out early in the morning. probably too early for my bal to be back to zero, but i figured id be better off risking the ticket than having to look her dad in the eyes come morning.

    Here is the article: happened last night. this girl i hung around with a couple times, even went skinny dipping with her once, calls me upand says she and her friend want to come have a few drinks and joints at my place. two girls? one of which i knew was attractive, and not too shy? damn rights they can come over.

so i go and pick them up. and the new girl is actually pretty good looking. older than i like, but looked great for her age, with a nice body, long healthy hair, and a few other things going for her. why, when she told me she had four kids i was blown away, would never have guessed it. no stretch marks, no visible sag... just a healthy and fairly hot cougar. the other girl is much younger, but after having skinny dipped with her, and not done anything else, i kinda figured she wasn't too interested in me that way. and me and this cougar were hitting it off.

so after the first six pack was done, and tenative plans for a swim were discarded, the younger girl decided she was going home, and the older one accepted my invite to grab some more beer and hang. so we did. two more six packs, strong beer, and proceeded to get a bit blitzed.

and one thing starts leading to another, got a hand on one of her firm tits, sucking her face, and my other hand starts working its way into her panties to stimulate her... penis!? wait, what? full stop. penis? 

this is where i always thought i would jump out a window or something... but she is still ready to go, looked pretty good, i was hammered, and she didn't want me to do anything to do with that... so, alright, fine, let's see what this anal hype is all about.

lights are out, i'm in, and slip out, and notice a dark shadow on the sheets. by this point i was already largely turned off, turns out i don't like anal nearly so much as actual sex, so i stop, get up, flip the lights on, and yup. shit all over. amazingly, there was no odor, but i was still disgusted, and at this point i was done. hopped in the shower, threw out my sheets, napped on the mattress, and drove the 'girl' home.

next time, i think i'll stick with my original plan of jumping out the window.

    Here is the summary: - friend calls me to hang a brings a girl, girl and i hit it off, girl's not a girl, near enough to one that i try... and got shit all over my only sheets, that are now in the dumpster.

    Here is the article: this didn't happen today, it happened around st. patrick's day. my boyfriend and i are both in college, and i wanted him to stay the night. he had a social thing that evening, and i wasn't sure if i'd be awake when he got back, so i left my dorm room door unlocked for him (which i've done in the past). a few hours later, he came in slightly drunk, got in bed, and we went to sleep. 

fast forward to 5 am. i'm a light sleeper, and i woke up to what i thought was my boyfriend getting back in bed. he was curled up at the end, which i thought was kinda weird, and kept trying to steal the covers, which annoyed me. i was pretty sleepy and confused at this point, but it didn't take long to realize my boyfriend was still peacefully asleep next to me. 

there was someone else in the bed with us. 

i freaked the fuck out, woke my boyfriend, and started whispering that there was a guy in bed with us. it took him about 5 minutes of groggily staring at the lump under the covers for the light bulb to click. 

turns out, it was my incredibly drunk neighbor who confused my room as his own when he got locked out of his. he was only in his underwear, so we had to give him clothes and shoes to go get the lock out key. i ran into him once afterwards, and he couldn't remember anything other than that he accidentally went into my room. 

the whole thing was weird, but we laugh about it now.

    Here is the summary: my drunk neighbor unknowingly slept in bed with my boyfriend and me. i learned that it is in fact possible to fit 3 adults in a twin sized bed.

fast forward to 5 am. i'm a light sleeper, and i woke up to what i thought was my boyfriend getting back in bed. he was curled up at the end, which i thought was kinda weird, and kept trying to steal the covers, which annoyed me. i was pretty sleepy and confused at this point, but it didn't take long to realize my boyfriend was still peacefully asleep next to me. 

there was someone else in the bed with us. 

i freaked the fuck out, woke my boyfriend, and started whispering that there was a guy in bed with us. it took him about 5 minutes of groggily staring at the lump under the covers for the light bulb to click. 

turns out, it was my incredibly drunk neighbor who confused my room as his own when he got locked out of his. he was only in his underwear, so we had to give him clothes and shoes to go get the lock out key. i ran into him once afterwards, and he couldn't remember anything other than that he accidentally went into my room. 

the whole thing was weird, but we laugh about it now.

    Here is the summary: I left my dorm room door unlocked for my boyfriend, who had a social thing that evening.

    Here is the article: this was about a week ago. my boyfriend was leaving for the military so we were spending as much time as possible together at a friend's place. this had become a daily thing for the past 2 weeks, so i had become pretty comfortable with going and sleeping on the couch while they continued drinking or playing video games. also, side note, my boyfriend and his friend still devoutly believe "girls don't fart". i've always lived up to this, because i think it'd be awkward and unattractive to do in front of people other than my family, but i digress.
so i pass out on the couch, and i vaguely remember waking up a few times and talking to them. one of the times, i was scooting down so his friend could sit on the couch. i remember saying something, and he responded with "but girls don't fart!" i remember laughing, farting, and falling back asleep while they all laughed too. if i was awake, this totally wouldn't have been something i'd do but.. i can't remember if it really happened or if it was a dream. i also remember waking up later, and crawling back up on the couch to my original spot when my boyfriend was wanting to crash, so i know i moved down for his friend..
the following morning, i wake up, extremely confused wondering if it really happened or was a dream. my boyfriend wakes up and looks at me with this slight smile, and then proceeds to tell me how much he loves me. it seemed really random from him.. it might be because he thought it was funny, or it might have been because it was one of our last few days together. i'm too afraid to find out which, but it haunts me.

    Here is the summary: : slept over at a friend's with my boyfriend, end up half-awake making jokes about farting, actually fart, fall back asleep, can't tell if it was a dream or not. fml

    Here is the article: so of course this wasn't today but a few years back.

i worked at a chevrolet dealership in the northeast usa, basically was the swiss army knife of the service department. a car would need an oil change and it was stupidly busy, i'd do it. a customer needed to be written up, or checked out, i'd do it. but a large part of my responsibility was administering the loaner car fleet. i'd sign customers up for them, bring the cars up, have the forms signed, gas up the cars, etc etc.

so it was a cold january morning and of course we had a landscaper customer that needed our heavy duty silverado 2500 pick up truck that was blocked by 2 other cars in the pen we kept the loaners in. to top it off they were all covered in snow and the pen was icy. i try to find elio, our lot manager to help me out, but i couldn't find him. now it's pretty easy to lose him as hes always on the move and he's a 4'11 shorty. so i figured whatever, i grabbed the snow broom and the keys to the 3 cars.

as soon as i get in remote range i press the remote start buttons on the 3 cars to warm them up and defrost the windshield to make it a little easier and faster. now on chevy's when you remote start them they honk twice. all 3 cars honk at the same time and i see a pair of legs fly in the air. wtf? i walk closer and find elio laying on the ground knocked out. a hospital ride and concussion test later, i startled elio with the honks, he slipped on some ice and cartoon style fell on his head.

    Here is the article: obligatory this happened yesterday.

so i do taxidermy and i got my first coyote this winter. not wanting to let anything go to waste i decided to try my hands at cold water maceration to remove the meat from the skull, metatarsals, metacarpals, and tail. for those of you that do not know what cold water maceration is, it's when you just fill a bucket with water and leave it outside to grow bacteria and rot off the flesh, gross right? but this was my first time, i underestimated the level of gross... grossly.

my mom's fiance had been complaining about the smell in the back yard and suggest i dump some out and put in fresh water to settle the stench down. i said i'd have to make a trip to the train tracks cause i reckon is going to be fucking putrid. fuck up number one, he says there's no need, just do it in the alley way. i really wasn't comfortable with that so i let it sit a few more days (it's already been stewing two months). the bucket is brought up again and, as fuck up number two, out of laziness i believe that i can dump it in the alley, in broad daylight(fuck up number three).


i can smell it a bit, and i got nervous as i started pouring the brown broth that evidently even maggots can't survive in. did i mention i also poured a can of beer into it last month to really fuel the bacterial growth? cause i did.

i'm halfway through pouring in the dry as fuck 90 degree heat and i'm mortified with regret watching this fucking sick shit roll down the street, it's taking everything i have not to gag.

i start panicking, cause this shit is rancid. i mean, i'd throw a bunch of metaphors in at this point, but there's just no comparing the stench of hot death soup, it's in a league of its own. 

i rush inside, grab a bottle of all purpose cleaner, a gallon of bleach, and a gallon of ammonia(fuck up number i don't fucking know). i'm staving off a panic attack, the whole goddamn block smells like someone just uncovered a garage full of rotting corpses. the cleaner and bleach just.. it just doesn't work... now it's a chemical spill in a mass grave. it does no making of the smell, meanwhile i've had the hose on doing all i can to diffuse the situation.

god, just writing this makes me realize how unbelievable it all must sound, but i don't care, this is my worst and best fuck up ever and i have to share it. 

anyways, a group of fucking children walks down the goddamn alley and i'm at a loss, i really am, thinking i'm the worst fucking neighbor ever, i'm ruining everyones nice day, and praying the authorities aren't called. the kids are fucking 20 feet up wind and start to complain and wretch. they just look at me with the most twisted faces of anguish i've ever seen, holding their noses and picking up speed to walk by. i apologize a thousand times and say we found a bucket of ours has filled with water over the winter and we think something died in it. 

so anyways, i can't wait for the bleach to disperse, especially after the kids walked by, and i poured the ammonia, and it starts to fucking gas up. im dying, i'm dead, my life is over, i'm gassing my fucking neighborhood with mustard gas, and lord jesus i'm so sorry, i truly am.

luckily for me the vapors don't really make it a foot off the ground, but it was still terrifying. the sun starts to go down, my mom is taking over hose duty and reassuring me it's alright and what's done is done. her fiance is laughing because he meant if i did dump it in the alley i'd have enough sense to do it at night, or during a rain storm, and it in the front of the house he watched a group of girls complain about a smell and went inside to play.

it's funny now, but i was in a full blown panic, and i thank fucking heaven that no one bothered us about this incident.

on the plus side, the skull looks beautiful, and the smell did really start to die down after a second gallon of ammonia was poured by my sweet understanding mother, there was no more mustard gas.

    Here is the summary: ruined my neighborhood and watched the innocence of children disappear.

i rush inside, grab a bottle of all purpose cleaner, a gallon of bleach, and a gallon of ammonia(fuck up number i don't fucking know). i'm staving off a panic attack, the whole goddamn block smells like someone just uncovered a garage full of rotting corpses. the cleaner and bleach just.. it just doesn't work... now it's a chemical spill in a mass grave. it does no making of the smell, meanwhile i've had the hose on doing all i can to diffuse the situation.

god, just writing this makes me realize how unbelievable it all must sound, but i don't care, this is my worst and best fuck up ever and i have to share it. 

anyways, a group of fucking children walks down the goddamn alley and i'm at a loss, i really am, thinking i'm the worst fucking neighbor ever, i'm ruining everyones nice day, and praying the authorities aren't called. the kids are fucking 20 feet up wind and start to complain and wretch. they just look at me with the most twisted faces of anguish i've ever seen, holding their noses and picking up speed to walk by. i apologize a thousand times and say we found a bucket of ours has filled with water over the winter and we think something died in it. 

so anyways, i can't wait for the bleach to disperse, especially after the kids walked by, and i poured the ammonia, and it starts to fucking gas up. im dying, i'm dead, my life is over, i'm gassing my fucking neighborhood with mustard gas, and lord jesus i'm so sorry, i truly am.

luckily for me the vapors don't really make it a foot off the ground, but it was still terrifying. the sun starts to go down, my mom is taking over hose duty and reassuring me it's alright and what's done is done. her fiance is laughing because he meant if i did dump it in the alley i'd have enough sense to do it at night, or during a rain storm, and it in the front of the house he watched a group of girls complain about a smell and went inside to play.

it's funny now, but i was in a full blown panic, and i thank fucking heaven that no one bothered us about this incident.

on the plus side, the skull looks beautiful, and the smell did really start to die down after a second gallon of ammonia was poured by my sweet understanding mother, there was no more mustard gas.

    Here is the summary: I got my first coyote this winter and decided to try my hands at cold water maceration to remove the meat from the skull, metatarsals, metacarpals, and tail.

    Here is the article: obligatory this happened yesterday.

so i do taxidermy and i got my first coyote this winter. not wanting to let anything go to waste i decided to try my hands at cold water maceration to remove the meat from the skull, metatarsals, metacarpals, and tail. for those of you that do not know what cold water maceration is, it's when you just fill a bucket with water and leave it outside to grow bacteria and rot off the flesh, gross right? but this was my first time, i underestimated the level of gross... grossly.

my mom's fiance had been complaining about the smell in the back yard and suggest i dump some out and put in fresh water to settle the stench down. i said i'd have to make a trip to the train tracks cause i reckon is going to be fucking putrid. fuck up number one, he says there's no need, just do it in the alley way. i really wasn't comfortable with that so i let it sit a few more days (it's already been stewing two months). the bucket is brought up again and, as fuck up number two, out of laziness i believe that i can dump it in the alley, in broad daylight(fuck up number three).


i can smell it a bit, and i got nervous as i started pouring the brown broth that evidently even maggots can't survive in. did i mention i also poured a can of beer into it last month to really fuel the bacterial growth? cause i did.

i'm halfway through pouring in the dry as fuck 90 degree heat and i'm mortified with regret watching this fucking sick shit roll down the street, it's taking everything i have not to gag.

    Here is the article: yay i have something to post on tifu. kudos for it being today i think.

so i'm currently in 8th grade, and there is this classmate that nobody likes, we'll call her allison. allison has always been a suck up since she came to the school in 6th grade. she always snitches on people over nothing, and just acts like a suck-up while she treats everyone else like a bitch. now allison happens to be really obese, and that will play a big part in this.

before this story goes on, i don't support fat shaming, but i do use the fact that she is fat as something to criticize her about.

so on wednesday (may 6), allison pissed my friend, who we'll call alex, and i off. alex was chewing gum and allison sees that. she waits until a teacher is nearby and loudly says "alex, is that gum you're chewing?" the teacher then catches word of this and gives him detention for it. he obviously can't do anything and just accepts it. 

when alex gets out of detention, he is obviously mad (note: she has a reputation for being a cunt and getting people in trouble for stupid reasons). we start saying the usual crap we say about her, and we just call her a bitch and make fun of her weight and stuff.

we thought that it was over with, but apparently it wasn't. today alex went to watch a movie for a school event, and allison happened to be there. after the movie alex was using his phone and allison took it from him and ran with it. she decided to look through his messages and saw ours. she got pissed and give him his phone and went somewhere. we currently have no idea what is going to happen about it (she is a suck up and so every teacher likes her), and are scared about it. i'll post updates if this gets big.

    Here is the summary: classmate is a cunt and reads my friend and mine texts about her.

    Here is the article: so, about a week ago i made a frantic post about being caught watching porn. after i made the post i went offline for a few hours and came back to find half the people calling it fake and half the people assuring me that everyone enjoys some good horseporn every once in a while. i ended up deleting that post, not caring enough to reply to all the angry responses.

to recap: i got a text from my mom, who was at nursing school, that she just received an email from our isp (frankfort plant board) that someone had torrented copyrighted porn and if it happened again legal action may ensue. that's all she told me besides that she would talk to me when she got home.

i panicked, i had kept everything hidden up to that point. and, the night before, i had decided to watch some more extreme fetishes and explore a little bit, including ending up on /r/bestiality for like 5 minutes. i never stopped to think and go "but wait, i don't even have torrenting software and never download my porn...". instead, i simply assumed that my mom saw all and now thought i liked to sneak off and fuck horses in my spare time, which i certainly don't.

i sat there feeling really anxious, and ended up passing the time by making my original frantic post and playing some supreme commander with my buddies, who i discussed argument tactics that i could use against her with me.

30 minutes before she got home, i had a game plan. i'd caught her watching porn *several* times before, and have also uncovered that she's part of a bdsm group. but, i never mentioned any of this, not wanting to put her in an awkward position. so, when she got home i was going to explain that this is something all normal teens and adults do, and im sorry for the dmca claim. if she pushed the argument further, i would point out all the revealing stuff about her sex life ive found out over the years.

it was a foolproof plan, it was sure to work.

30 minutes later, she sits me down and says "why were you looking at transexual porn?". "what?" i say. out of all the fetishes i watched, i hadn't watched any transexual porn, not that there is anything wrong with that.
"don't play around it! look at this gross shit you watched! are you turned on by this? it's fucking gross!". she opened up a window. on it, a torrent download existed for a movie called "ts-playground" with some thumbnail photos of shemales fucking shemales.

"i never watched that shit.." i say out loud. she then proceeds to fucking unload on me about how i can't fucking lie to her and how gross it is, and i end up just sitting there and crying the whole time. i never had the courage to mention that she watches porn too.

but, on the bright side, this was not my porn. she hadn't seen any of the shit i had actually watched. but, this meant someone on our network had torrented highly copyrighted porn and used me as a scapegoat.

my mom took my pc and phone, saying i wouldn't get them for a month, and then went to go talk to my uncle who lived nextdoor, and also used our wifi network. 10 minutes later she comes back with a blank look on her face and says "ok, um, you can have your pc back" and walks awkwardly back in to her room. 

so, now she just kind of won't look me in the eye. i suspect my uncle or his roomate were the ones who downloaded the porn. so, i never really got caught, i was just blamed when someone else got caught.

 

(sorry for any bad grammar. away from home right now so i had to write this on a phone)

edit: to fix any confusion, i am not into bestiality of any form, i just browsed it for a short while but left quickly. i would never attempt bestiality on a live animal.

    Here is the summary: got blamed for my uncle's illegal transexual porn. thought my mom thought i was a horse fucker

    Here is the article: i was walking home from the library after some intense physics studying, feeling pretty good. i jog a little bit, and throw a few snowballs because it's dark and why not. im walking next to a house surrounded by bushes and i see a garbage can on the curb about 15 feet in front of me. i like to think i'm a bit like steph curry so i quickly make a small, dense snowball. i harmlessly toss it towards the garbage and last second i see a person walk out of the bushes to throw out their trash. well you can probably guess what happens next. the snowball hits this bitch right on her hood and she glares at me for a good 5 seconds. i try to avoid eye contact at all costs and as i'm walking past her she mumbles something. glad she didn't get her husband or something.

    Here is the article: *obligatory sentence about this not happening today*

so a couple friends of mine and i decided to meet up as a full group for the first time in a while, we ended up on wagamama's because a new one had opened up recently in our area and most of us had never had it before. someone booked a table and we arrive at the place for our reservation around 6.

some context is necessary so i'll say that i have had a thing for one of the girls in our group for a while now (we'll call her emily), and it seemed like we were finally starting to click so i was looking forward to the meal out.

we were seated and i, for some reason, decided to set directly opposite emily as it was sort of a bench/table kinda set up (japanese restauraunt). at this point emily had been pretty excited for the meal and was looking forward to her delicious chicken rice thingy that was soon to arrive. i ordered chicken ramen because yum.

(the inside of this place was pretty nice btw but thats not why you're here so i'll get on with it.)

we are all out enjoying our food (there's about 6 of us) when this small child starts crying reasonably loudly, now i normally just get on and eat, but my friend, (lets call him derek) decides to make the stupidest joke my ears have ever heard and make me burst out laughing with a mouthful of chicken in my enormous gob. i manage to hold off the first wave of laughter and keep the chicken in my mouth but then, (oh god i cringe just typing it) i just erupted like st.helens and sent a whole piece of (thankfully) unchewed chicken straight on to emily's plate. fan-fucking-tastic. my friends immediately burst out laughing and i'm just left looking like the biggest mug buddha has ever set on to this earth.

i apologised profusely but just spend the rest of the dinner quitely looking at my phone and trying to not just make my situation worse than it already is. 

yay.

    Here is the article: well, i had to create a throwaway for this because, i fucked up pretty bad. here's some background, i'm a 20 year old college student, my neighbors that i'll call jill and carlos are in their mid thirties, are married and have 4 kids, one together three from a previous marriage. i honestly feel so much guilt for this, and i don't excuse nor condone my actions, i just felt the need to vent about this fuck up.

**here's where i fucked up**

this started about a month and a half ago, one night i was at my neighbor's apartment and we were drinking pretty much most of the night. for a few weeks prior to this incident, jill has been venting to me about her marital problems. like me, she has a rather high sex drive and likes physical affection. we've been good friends for about a year and a half, so i figured fuck it i'll listen and give the advice i deemed appropriate for the situation. i mostly just suggested communicating with her husband about her needs before it gets blown way out of left field and it ends up turning into a clusterfuck. i assumed she did so, and everything was fine. well, i soon learned i was wrong. thanks to the emotional and honesty enhancer known as drinking too much rum they got in a huuuuge argument. it was pretty fucking nasty, and i was just sitting there, cigarette in one hand, a shot of rum in the other attempting my best to be dr. phil and calm them both down. well, that shit didn't work at all. i vaguely remember how the argument started, and a majority of the exchange, but what i remember most was the breaking point which was carlos calling her a "stupid fucking whore" jill threw her drink at him and she stormed out as if she was going to take off. 

usually i try my best to avoid these situations, but i'm not going to let a friend who's obviously drunk drive. so i go after her to at least try to calm her down, and also try to take the heat off of her husband under the guise of "can't handle liquor syndrome" (either way i didn't approve of his actions) honestly, it was the first time i've seen that side of him. we usually have a few beers and watch some baseball, have guy time and shit like that and he's fine. but, hard liquor in excess amounts apparently makes him into an irritable asshole. thankfully after this incident they never drank anything harder than beer. nonetheless, i convinced her to not drive off. sweet i did one good deed right? yes, but then it triggered the fuck up. i didn't drink as much compared to them because i'm not a fan of hard liquor, so i had a few shots and a beer over the course of the night so i'm at an manageable level. jill, is pretty fucking drunk. 

she was awkwardly close to me, i just figured "meh, she's just probably close so if she stumbles i could catch her or whatever." she thanked me, then kissed me, which threw me the fuck off guard. i pulled away and told her something along the lines about i'll just play that off as a drunken mistake. i mean, shit we all do stupid things drunk so it is what it is. well apparently in the heat of the moment she meant it because she told me "i always wanted try a black guy." now, under completely different circumstances this would of been a *fuck yeah i'm getting laid* moment. but, morality kicked in and i just played it off again trying to change the conversation. **i should've walked away after that,** but my drunk ass didn't. i just kept avoiding and ignoring the obvious attempts of seduction, and like a dumbass, i gave in eventually. 

we kissed again, next thing i knew she grabbed my dick, then before i know it our drunk asses are hidden behind cars in the rather small apartment complex's parking garage having sex. i really don't recall  the act in it's entirety, but what i remember basically was she was bent over, and i wasn't wearing a fucking condom. i'm pretty sure i didn't cum inside of her because the next morning i noticed i had a cum stain on my shoe. after that we pretty much just sat outside until the sun came up just talking, her husband passed out on the couch i'm assuming shortly after i left, so he didn't look for neither of us.  we parted ways around what i figured was a quarter to 6am, i laid on the couch, watched something on netflix and just slept it off.

next morning, i had a holy shit moment. to this day, i believe it was just a drunken hate fuck that shouldn't of never happened. so, while her husband was out working, and the kids were gone, i kinda wanted to clear the air about what the fuck happened the night before. **here's where i fucked up again.** when i asked her "do you remember last night?" she pretty much only remembered the whole kissing part, and apologized and admitted if she was in a better frame of mind mentally, and sober it probably wouldn't of happened she was angry, and wanted to feel wanted and i was the target of that spontaneous affection. i should've then told her we had sex. but, then the images of her husband rifle flashed in my mind, and i pretty much failed to mention it out of fear for the potential fallout, versus just owning up to my mistake. 

between that incident, and yesterday i wasn't hanging around there as often as i used to. i'd occasionally stop by to say what's up, or bum a smoke. just have idle chit chat with them. well, yesterday i was laying around playing some xbox, and carlos called me, so i answered. the gist of the conversation was he was heading home from work, and the baseball game was coming on, so he wanted to know if i wanted a beer and we could just kick back, watch the game and have some bro time. fuck it, i wasn't doing much anyways, so i accepted. plus i've been stressed out anyways so a beer sounded great. he got there about 5 minutes after i did, and asked me "did jill tell you the good news?" i replied no, and she interjected with "i'm pregnant!" [my mental reaction when she said that](http://i.imgur.com/abbo5jh.gif) i wanted to leave, but i figured i should just play it cool and congratulate them because they're obviously excited. plus i didn't want to seem suspicious. so, we pretty much watched the game, carlos and i had a beer, then i left shortly after using the excuse my back problems were fucking with me, they didn't question it. i said my goodbyes. and now here i am. either she's aware that we had sex and she's been playing it off because we haven't talked privately and feels guilty like me, or she completely forgot. either way, i'm in a clusterfuck, and i could possibly be the father of their child. 

  

oh, and til i make stupid decisions while drinking hard liquor.  ever since then, i haven't drank anything but that one beer, and i don't see myself ever drinking anything stronger than that again.

    Here is the summary: got drunk with my neighbors one night, they fought, i had drunken hate sex with his wife, a month & a half later after the sex   they announced they're expecting a child i'm possibly responsible for. this is some straight up maury shit.

usually i try my best to avoid these situations, but i'm not going to let a friend who's obviously drunk drive. so i go after her to at least try to calm her down, and also try to take the heat off of her husband under the guise of "can't handle liquor syndrome" (either way i didn't approve of his actions) honestly, it was the first time i've seen that side of him. we usually have a few beers and watch some baseball, have guy time and shit like that and he's fine. but, hard liquor in excess amounts apparently makes him into an irritable asshole. thankfully after this incident they never drank anything harder than beer. nonetheless, i convinced her to not drive off. sweet i did one good deed right? yes, but then it triggered the fuck up. i didn't drink as much compared to them because i'm not a fan of hard liquor, so i had a few shots and a beer over the course of the night so i'm at an manageable level. jill, is pretty fucking drunk. 

she was awkwardly close to me, i just figured "meh, she's just probably close so if she stumbles i could catch her or whatever." she thanked me, then kissed me, which threw me the fuck off guard. i pulled away and told her something along the lines about i'll just play that off as a drunken mistake. i mean, shit we all do stupid things drunk so it is what it is. well apparently in the heat of the moment she meant it because she told me "i always wanted try a black guy." now, under completely different circumstances this would of been a *fuck yeah i'm getting laid* moment. but, morality kicked in and i just played it off again trying to change the conversation. **i should've walked away after that,** but my drunk ass didn't. i just kept avoiding and ignoring the obvious attempts of seduction, and like a dumbass, i gave in eventually. 

we kissed again, next thing i knew she grabbed my dick, then before i know it our drunk asses are hidden behind cars in the rather small apartment complex's parking garage having sex. i really don't recall  the act in it's entirety, but what i remember basically was she was bent over, and i wasn't wearing a fucking condom. i'm pretty sure i didn't cum inside of her because the next morning i noticed i had a cum stain on my shoe. after that we pretty much just sat outside until the sun came up just talking, her husband passed out on the couch i'm assuming shortly after i left, so he didn't look for neither of us.  we parted ways around what i figured was a quarter to 6am, i laid on the couch, watched something on netflix and just slept it off.

next morning, i had a holy shit moment. to this day, i believe it was just a drunken hate fuck that shouldn't of never happened. so, while her husband was out working, and the kids were gone, i kinda wanted to clear the air about what the fuck happened the night before. **here's where i fucked up again.** when i asked her "do you remember last night?" she pretty much only remembered the whole kissing part, and apologized and admitted if she was in a better frame of mind mentally, and sober it probably wouldn't of happened she was angry, and wanted to feel wanted and i was the target of that spontaneous affection. i should've then told her we had sex. but, then the images of her husband rifle flashed in my mind, and i pretty much failed to mention it out of fear for the potential fallout, versus just owning up to my mistake. 

between that incident, and yesterday i wasn't hanging around there as often as i used to. i'd occasionally stop by to say what's up, or bum a smoke. just have idle chit chat with them. well, yesterday i was laying around playing some xbox, and carlos called me, so i answered. the gist of the conversation was he was heading home from work, and the baseball game was coming on, so he wanted to know if i wanted a beer and we could just kick back, watch the game and have some bro time. fuck it, i wasn't doing much anyways, so i accepted. plus i've been stressed out anyways so a beer sounded great. he got there about 5 minutes after i did, and asked me "did jill tell you the good news?" i replied no, and she interjected with "i'm pregnant!" [my mental reaction when she said that](http://i.imgur.com/abbo5jh.gif) i wanted to leave, but i figured i should just play it cool and congratulate them because they're obviously excited. plus i didn't want to seem suspicious. so, we pretty much watched the game, carlos and i had a beer, then i left shortly after using the excuse my back problems were fucking with me, they didn't question it. i said my goodbyes. and now here i am. either she's aware that we had sex and she's been playing it off because we haven't talked privately and feels guilty like me, or she completely forgot. either way, i'm in a clusterfuck, and i could possibly be the father of their child. 

  

oh, and til i make stupid decisions while drinking hard liquor.  ever since then, i haven't drank anything but that one beer, and i don't see myself ever drinking anything stronger than that again.

    Here is the summary: I fucked up pretty bad.

    3. Rate the summary with 5 percentages, where each one represents how likely the summary is going to get a score from 1 to 5. For example, if you think the summary is 80% likely to get a score of 5, 10% likely to get a score of 4, 5% likely to get a score of 3, 3% likely to get a score of 2, and 1% likely to get a score of 1, you should rate the summary as 80, 10, 5, 3, 2.

    Here is the article: so last night i come home late at night around 1 o'clock and before i got out of my vehicle i put my keys in my pocket for some reason just before i went to reach for my backpack in the backseat. within that time, the lanyard attached to my keys caught on my seatbelt buckle and when i went to open my door and get out they fell out of my pocket and bam the door shut and i was locked out of not only my vehicle but my house as well... i now had only two options, number 1 was to call my roommate who was sleeping inside, or number 2 try to break in to my own house through a bedroom window. so i first tried to call my roommate but not only did i have only 5% battery life left, my roommate is a really heavy sleeper. needless to say, many phonecalls later my phone died, so i moved onto trying to find my way into my house. my plan was to climb onto the roof of the house and work my way around to my bedroom window that was unlocked and unalarmed, so i tried to stand on the roof of my vehicle to reach the ledge of the roof but all i could reach was the flimsy gutter on the edge of the roof so i haulted that approach due to the fact that i would rip the gutter right off, so i move to the back yard and try again. now i live in a townhouse that is one of 5 in a row, each townhouse has a small backyard with a 9ft fence separating them. so now my only way i could get onto the roof was if i pulled myself up the fence and were able to step on the tops of the posts holding the fence together, my next problem was that im not that tall, i couldn't even reach the top of the fence while standing i had to make a running leap to reach it. with many attempts i managed to climb up and stand on the top of the fence, now i had to work my way across about 10 fenceposts and it was super easy to climb onto the roof, so away i went, now that i was standing on the roof i realised there was no way to get to my bedroom window on the other side of the house but i could see my roommates window which was totally reachable, but i also realised that the whole block around me could see me on the roof clear as day because there was a street light right behind my house that lit me up like the fourth of july, it crossed my mind that someone would call the cops on me for a thief or whatever but i thought that at that time of night there wouldnt be many people outside. so now, i went to go see if i could knock/open my roomates window, only thing was that it was actually locked so my only option was to try and knock loud enough to wake her up, so about 5 minutes later of the loudest knocking i could i see a figure come to the window through the blinds and slowly peer through, she screamed and backed up but heard me saying her name and who i was, so she opened the window with utter confusion "wh-why are you on the roof? i told her what had happened and she let me in and all was good, but not even a minute later i can hear police sirens outside, and a knock on the front door. the police had quite a few questions but ended up laughing about it. the only thing that sucked is that i didnt have a spare key so i had to pay for a specialist to get into my vehicle in the morning to get my keys out. i learned a good lesson that night, make sure my keys are in my hand before i close my door...

    Here is the summary: locked my keys in my vehicle late at night and couldnt get in my house, climbed on the roof, cops got called due to seeing me on the roof, and the rest is mystery

    Here is the article: so, unlike most tifu's, this certain situation didn't happen today, or yesterday. this happened my sophomore year of high school (i'm a freshman in college now). 

during class one day, a friend of mine and i were talking about a post we had seen on reddit. our teacher (i'll call her o) had overheard us, and immediately asked us if we were redditors. when we told her we were, she got super quiet and acted almost scared. this is where i got curious. 

earlier in the year, o had actually followed me and a few other students on instagram. once i got home, i looked up her instagram username on reddit, just to see if she might've had an account. an account came up, and at first it was just mainly boring shit. posts about dieting and golf. as i dug deeper, i noticed a post that looked really out of place.

**it was not a fucking dieting post.**

i opened it to find a woman completely naked laying in bed, with a title like "come [f]ind me ;)". at first, i couldn't believe it was o. but then i noticed her hair and basic figure was exactly the same, so i knew it was her. i decided to keep looking, and i found more nudes. so many naked pictures of my fucking english teacher. there was even gifs of her playing with "toys".  then i found several other posts she had made asking questions about sex, and weed.

i was blown away by what i had found, and immediately texted my friend about what i had found. at first, he thought i was crazy or joking. but once he looked for himself, he knew it was her. because i had genuinely liked o as a person and a teacher, i knew she could get in some deep shit if others at school had found out. i told my friend to keep it a secret, as i didn't want her getting in trouble. this is where i fucked up.

well, that shit wasn't a secret for more than a week, before the whole fucking school knew about her nudes. well, it also didn't take long for someone to tell her about what was going on either. she soon deleted all of her naked pictures, and shortly after her reddit account. somehow, someone had told her that i sent the pictures around school (i didn't) so now, she remembers me as the kid who could've gotten her fired.

    Here is the article: this happened when i was a chubby 13 year old boy who would devour anything in sight: 

i visited my mother's bedroom to find a tube of mini m&m's just sitting on the counter. me being the *fatso* that i was, i locked my sight on that m&m tube and ran towards it.

i grabbed the tube in my hand, popped the lid open, and put all the contents in my mouth.

*no ragrets*

after emptying that tube into my mouth, i had come to a horrifying realization:

*these were not m&ms*

my mom just finished cutting my little brother's toenails, and discarded the nails into that tube for an easy clean up. 

i have not touched mini m&m's since...

*no ragrets*

after emptying that tube into my mouth, i had come to a horrifying realization:

*these were not m&ms*

my mom just finished cutting my little brother's toenails, and discarded the nails into that tube for an easy clean up. 

i have not touched mini m&m's since...

    Here is the summary: I visited my mother's bedroom to find a tube of mini m&m's just sitting on the counter.

    Here is the article: this one actually happened today..i can still feel it. nsfw due to countless innuendos.

so this morning, i decided that for the good of my girlfriend and myself as well, i was going to trim the ol' hedges. i got into the bathroom and started going at it with the clippers. trimming a little here and there until i had it down to a desirable length. this part went nice and dandy. then i fucked up. 

i am one of those guys that keeps the bushes trimmed and the grounds bare, if you catch my drift. so i thought to myself, "man, shaving takes way too long, is there any way i can speed it up a little?" that's when my eye caught my beard trimmer, and a brilliant yet horrific light-bulb went on.

i grabbed the trimmers. i knew i needed it bare so my half a brain decided to pull the little plastic spacer off. i positioned my "knapsack" so that i had a flat area to work with, and (thinking i had a proper angle) flipped the switch and went for it. that's when the pain started. 

i reared back to reveal that i hadn't shaved any "hair down there", but had merely jabbed myself in the goody bag. those little teeth on the trimmer left my little backpack more perforated than a page out of a spiral notebook.

[here](http://i.imgur.com/5k6izfy.jpg) is a picture of the trimmer:

so i ended up in the shower watching blood pour from my wibbles, and now it hurts when i sit down.

    Here is the article: so yesterday i had my last a-level exam, (which are exams you do at the end of your last year at school), and to celebrate i decided to go out with a few friends before hitting a friend's party a bit later. as we're from the uk, and with temperatures at an all high 20 degrees (68 degrees f for you americans), it was compulsory for us to go outside somewhere.

being from a large university town (it's not cambridge) there are a huge amount of large open parks that we could've hit up and so me and my friends made a beeline for the closest one. after a while sitting in a small area, we decided to up sticks and head on closer to the river that went through the park. it was next to this river that we found one of those circular benches that enclosed a small tree. the tree was about 8ft tall and had obviously been planted there not long before.

anyway we sat around this bench and i started to just pick some leaves off the tree, as you do. after about 20-30 minutes had passed a dog ran up to us and we all did the normal shit that you do when a dog comes up. its owner then walked up and i for one assumed she'd say something about her dog but low and behold she said:
"excuse me, could you not pick the leaves off this tree, it's actually a memorial to my son."

not wanting to make eye contact in any way, i looked down and saw just how many leaves i had ripped from the tree, literally a pile sat there. 
what makes it worse is that when she said please don't take the leaves off, i just thought she was a tree loving hipster and so i almost did the old *cough* "hippy" *cough*. thank fuck i didn't.

    Here is the article: sorry happened 2 weeks ago....

i was heading home from work, and was passing a park and i had been battling the urge to pee, so i decided to pull over and do a quick number 1 in the bushes.

ran across the road, and found a dark area covered in some bushes and trees.

now this is where it all goes down hill and very quickly, about 2 seconds after i that relief feeling of letting it flow, the bush starts moving and swearing like a crazy 80 year old lady just heard bingo, suddenly a figure comes out of the bush.

i step back and froze. the homeless man goes into a giant rant about what is wrong with me? why am i not checking areas before peeing? basically asking all the questions someone would ask if someone peed on you while you were asleep.

i felt so bad, and asked him if there is anything i can do for him. he was more annoyed that he needs to find some money to clean his clothes, so i did the right thing and gave him 10 dollars.

he was happy about it, and turned back around to go back under the bush.

as i turned around, i said to him “its better to be pissed on than pissed off.”

he let out a little groan but i like to believe that little groan was a cover up for a laugh.

    Here is the article: of course, this happened over the past week. so i got this airduster, which contained dioflourothane. when you shake the can and spray it upside-down, it comes out in liquid form, which is really really cold. so, naturally i sprayed it on a leaf, (in an enclosed area) and smashed it. when i hit the leaf, i got a really bad cold burn. after that, being the 16 year old pyromaniac i am, i decided to see what would happen if i burned it. the first time i did it, it was in my room, and the flame was so high i almost burned my house down. the second time, i did it in the bathroom, in the sink, (so i could put it out quickly), and with the door locked, (so my parents didn't see me.) so, i sprayed it, inhaling the dioflourothane, into the sink, lit up the lighter, moving it really close to the sprayed area. it lit up way earlier than i thought it was going to, because the fumes lit it up, so i got a bad burn on my pinky. i reached for the sink faucet to put it out, but instead, i realized my hand was completely on fire, because it was covered in the stuff from before, so i ended up putting it out in the toilet. i now have third degree burns, all over my right hand, and my left is still hurting from the cold leaf. not only that, but my lungs feel terrible even after a week, because after researching, i found out when dioflourothane is burned, it releases some sort of chemical which is really toxic, and i was in a tiny,sealed bathroom. i feel like i took a couple of years out of my life. don't do what i did.

    Here is the summary: burned dioflourothane from an air duster, got second degree burns on my hand, got frostbite, and inhaled toxic chemicals.

    Here is the article: inspired by the "tifu by having sex whilst recovering from a tonsillectomy"

in england they rarely do tonsillectomies any more as they are considered to be worse for your immune system than keeping them in anyway. but i had constantly swollen tonsils and i was always sick so they had to come out.

it was 2 years ago this month, on the 27th so 11 days after my 19th birthday, i was quite nervous as i'd never had an operation before, but the procedure goes all well and i go to my parent's, i was staying with my parent's because you need to be monitored and not be alone whilst recovering. anyhow, it was 5 days in to recovering and i woke up at about 1pm and really thirsty, i stood up and i just feel as though i have phlegm at the back of my throat, so i cough into a tissue and it's blood, just a little. i rush downstairs to tell my dad and as i drink some water, i feel sick, i sprint to the toilet just in time for blood to spray all over the bathroom in what looked like the aftermath of a gruesome murder scene. 

at the time my dad couldn't drive and my mum was at work with no way to get in touch with her so my dad rings my auntie who isn't working at the time and the only person with a car who was close enough. after what seemed like an hour of throwing up blood constantly and pulling blood clots out of the back of my throat that were forming and cutting off my air supply, my auntie turns up. so there i was, throwing up blood into a huge bowl, in the back of my auntie's car on the 20 min drive to a&e. when we get there the bowl is pretty much full and i'm rushed into the back, with nurses impressed that i'm still concious at this point and i get put on a monitor to monitor my heart rate and a doctor comes in and tries shoving hydrogen peroxide in the back of my throat which tastes fucking disgusting and he tried to stop the bleeding with 10 mins of pouring hydrogen peroxide down my throat and me gagging. 

eventually he says that i'd need to get it stitched back up and i have to sign some sort of document, at this point i don't care what it said i signed it and was rushed to the operating theatre, i can't remember if i passed out or was put under, but i woke up 5 hours later with packing and stitches in my throat, having had blood transfusions too, i was apparently close to bleeding out. they had to pump my stomach because of how much blood was in there too. 

2 years later and whenever i feel something at the back of my throat i have to check it's not blood. apparently the problem was attributed to a student surgeon who was allowed to do my procedure because it was a teaching hospital i was at.

    Here is the summary: had tonsils out, coughed up litres and litres of blood, nearly died.

    Here is the article: so the real fuck up happened on july 4th but it's been in the making for some time now...

about a year ago i found my dad online and reconnected with him. (he had left my mom when i was very little and never came back). turns out he's doing really well regrets the way he acted in the past and is trying to remedy our father-son relationship. i found out that he remarried and they both have a child of their own. the thing is that my dad legally signed all his rights away from me, so he's legally not my father anymore. all that backstory aside:

i also discovered that my dad's wife has a sister who has a daughter that's roughly my age. when i first met her i had this weird feeling inside, you know that one when you think holy shit how is it legal for someone too be this perfect? whelp, needless to say that wasn't going to work out happily for anyone. or so i thought.

turns out, after meeting her we talked, exchanged information, and realized we actually have a ton in common. like, we pretty much have identical tastes. we got a long too well some might say, and i ended up starting to hangout with just her and not my dad or my half-sister. all i wanted to do was hangout with my semi-cousin.

as things progressed i started to get bolder in my feelings for her and ultimately ended up deciding that i don't care about anything else. i just needed to tell her i liked her, no matter the consequences. yeah, i'm fucking dumb. picture this, it's july 4th my whole dad's family is gathered at their house. cousin is there, we're drinking and having a great time. roughly around 11-12 as people are starting to launch more fireworks i ask her to go on the balcony with me so we can watch them and i just lay it out. i tell her how i feel and i tell her i've liked her since i met her. fuck me right?

whelp, she ended up saying roughly the same thing to me. she told me she likes me too and that she wishes we weren't part of a family. then i say the real fuck up, the motherlode (50ksimcash), i say why should we let that stop us? and we make out, most legendary fucking euphoric moment of my life, but it happened and we both are kind of just stunned afterwords. and when we realize what we've just done we look back into the entertainment room connected to the balcony and my half sister is just staring at us. like a fucking video camera recording everything into their memory. i left that moment and haven't spoke to any of them since or answered my phone to any of their calls.

i don't know what to do, being super beta right now. but fuck man. i still can't believe i did it. disclaimer, i'm still talking to cousin, we are trying to figure this all out.

    Here is the summary: dad legally disowned me as a kid but i found him, reconnected, found out i have a cousin, get too close with cousin, make out with cousin, half-sister sees this. life ruined.

whelp, she ended up saying roughly the same thing to me. she told me she likes me too and that she wishes we weren't part of a family. then i say the real fuck up, the motherlode (50ksimcash), i say why should we let that stop us? and we make out, most legendary fucking euphoric moment of my life, but it happened and we both are kind of just stunned afterwords. and when we realize what we've just done we look back into the entertainment room connected to the balcony and my half sister is just staring at us. like a fucking video camera recording everything into their memory. i left that moment and haven't spoke to any of them since or answered my phone to any of their calls.

i don't know what to do, being super beta right now. but fuck man. i still can't believe i did it. disclaimer, i'm still talking to cousin, we are trying to figure this all out.

    Here is the summary: I found my dad online and reconnected with him.

    Here is the article: so the real fuck up happened on july 4th but it's been in the making for some time now...

about a year ago i found my dad online and reconnected with him. (he had left my mom when i was very little and never came back). turns out he's doing really well regrets the way he acted in the past and is trying to remedy our father-son relationship. i found out that he remarried and they both have a child of their own. the thing is that my dad legally signed all his rights away from me, so he's legally not my father anymore. all that backstory aside:

i also discovered that my dad's wife has a sister who has a daughter that's roughly my age. when i first met her i had this weird feeling inside, you know that one when you think holy shit how is it legal for someone too be this perfect? whelp, needless to say that wasn't going to work out happily for anyone. or so i thought.

turns out, after meeting her we talked, exchanged information, and realized we actually have a ton in common. like, we pretty much have identical tastes. we got a long too well some might say, and i ended up starting to hangout with just her and not my dad or my half-sister. all i wanted to do was hangout with my semi-cousin.

    Here is the article: happened like a week ago and sorry for 4chin-type formatting, trying to keep it short...

male, in my 20s. migrated to australia when i was young; born in an slavic country. euroeastern friends jealous af. a few slavic girls (friends from past) tried to suggestively get in touch w / me for the past few years cause they wanna migrate.    

didn't reply to any because:  
  
 1. my new homeland has enough refugees as it is...
 2. fuck paying for shit, and the paperwork.
 3. can't type fast enough in my first language to communicate online (didn't keep in contact with my slavic friends for more than 10 years so i forgot a lot of the grammar and vocabulary).  
   
slavgirl4-8/10 - requests to add her on skype. turns out we went to a kindergarten together (she extracted my contact details from my grandma...).  
  
check out her profile pic, contemplate for a solid hour -
boner wins so i add her (omgwhatnow.jpeg).

we start messaging cause i ain't webcam-genic. remember that i can't type for shit, but manage to slowly find out that she's really smart. she finished high school with a gold medal and got a scholarship at an english-teaching uni.

try to type out some lame joke but feel like she's aging so i say *"brb - 15mins"*. she complies.

quickly open word and start typing out separate generic phrases **among with responses** in my 'slavic' language - i.e. "how are the studies going?" "oh cool!" "well i'm studying it" "it's alright, wouldn't mind being a sysadmin once i get on track.." "so what have you got planned after you graduate?" **"hah, nice"** and more...

get distracted by cat, by mistake ctrl-a and ctrl-c go to skype and ctrl-v. hit enter and instantly realise what i've done. 

heart sinks as i see her start typing. /r/cringe got nothing.  she sends a confused emoji. i start typing even more slowly to try and explain myself. can't think of what to say. abandon ship by changing my status to "away".
  
she's still in my skype list, we haven't talked since.

    Here is the article: so this happened about 3 days ago, but i only just realized how i fucked up now.

i was really drunk, and really hungry. it was friday night, and i had a bag of chips in my room.
now, naturally i'm not going to get out of bed to eat chips, and being the drunk fuck that i was at the time, i didn't think anything of it.

cue 7:30am the next day. i wake up covered in crumbs. i look over groggily and see that my chips spilled aaaaaaalllll over my bed. thinking nothing of it, i proceed to go back to sleep.
now, i spent the entire day hungover, so as you can imagine, i got nothing done. including cleaning off my bed (yes, i'm a slob okay?).

thing is, my roommate has a dog. a wee little pomeranian. so i left for a couple hours, and accidentally left my door open.

when i came back, the chips have all been eaten. there was a good half bag there.

move on to today (about 3 days later), and the dog hasn't shit since then. i don't know what to do, but i don't want to tell my roommate. all the dog's been doing is sitting around all day, staring at me.

    Here is the summary: got drunk, got cheese everywhere, got roommate's dog constipated.

    Here is the article: just to start things off, this was not today. this happened about 7 years ago, but i felt like you guys might enjoy it anyway

so my mother works at the state health department, and they had an employee free vaccination day extended to the families of the employees as well. pretty cool stuff. so obviously my mom wanted to get me vaccinated. 

the problem was, i was absolutely bat shit terrified of needles. i mean i was like 10 so it's not too odd, but like damn i had nightmares about that shit. 

needless to say, the line for free vaccines was pretty long, and i sat outside in the winter for about an hour, in a cold sweat thinking about it. and as a kid, one hour feels like two eternities so it was even worse. eventually we get in the clinic and my heart starts racing like fucking nascar. the nurse does the routine "are you scared of needles? it won't hurt. turn away!". so i close my eyes and hold my breath. as soon as i feel something touch the nurse, i scream, push her away and rip the needle out of my arm and drop it, crying my balls off.

now the nurse is freaking out cuz she spilt some of the vaccine and didn't know how much she gave me and couldn't give me more, or if there was an air bubble in the needle or whatever. so the health department shuts that place down since they didn't want to be liable for malpractice and they never had vaccines at that location again.

    Here is the summary: i ripped a vaccine out of my arm, and they shut down a clinic for free vaccines so they didn't get sued for malpractice.

    Here is the article: so this didn't really happen today, it was more like a few years ago. we had to buy fish for a class, and we were supposed to keep track of its growth and take pics of it and all to paste in some scrapbook. when the project was over, i promptly forgot that my fish existed because y'know. fishes don't make noise when you forget to feed them.

two weeks later, my stepdad asks me if i've fed my fish so i was like, "oh right, i have a fish." so i go upstairs and check on it. fish hasn't been fed for two weeks, fishbowl was filthy as hell, and fish is unresponsive on the bottom of the bowl. now, i wasn't sure if it was dead or not because i was told that fish float when they are dead. mine was at the bottom. i took a stick and stirred the bowl to try and wake the fish up, perhaps it'll spur it into moving right? the fish just swirled around lifelessly so i assumed it was dead. i flushed it down the toilet.

years later, i recount this story to my so and he looks at me weirdly. "your fish wasn't dead yet, it was just in a coma. if it was dead it would float." cue me hysterically screaming about how i was a fish murderer. guilt haunts me til this day.

    Here is the summary: forgot to feed fish for two weeks, find fish in fish coma, thought it was dead so i flushed it, but actually just put it out of its misery.

    Here is the article: so i was presuming with some of my friends before we went out to party hop for the night.  we're all talking about how hard it is to get with girls, no matter if you treat them with respect or be a complete douchebag towards them; one of my friends remark how the only successful way to talk with a girl for more than ten minutes at a party is by being gay.  another one of my friends then comes up with the brilliant plan of one of us pretending that we are gay just to see how far we can get talking to a girl (by far we meant how long were could actually be able to talk to a girl without her walking away thinking we were too creepy or something along that line).  everyone in the room looks around at each other, trying to figure out who is can act the most gay, convincingly.  with a good amount of alcohol already in my system, i burst out in a voice worthy of big gay al from south park and immediately "win" the position of "designated fake-gay guy" for the night.

so we get to a party, once we're inside my friends tell me that they're going to pick the girl that i have to talk to.  i was expecting them to pick some girl that they knew i wouldn't want to talk to at all, but fortunately (or unfortunately) they choose this absolute beauty for me to talk to.  now when i say beauty i mean front page of maxim beauty; i immediately regret my decision to take part in this experiment and think about backing out, but then i convince myself not to be a wuss and go through with the bet.  to make my act more convincing i ask one of the girls we met at the party for her drink (a vodka cranberry of course) instead of the beer i was drinking at the moment.  i make my way towards the girl (we'll call her michelle) and when i finally get to her i "trip" and "accidentally" spill some of my drink on her.  i immediately begin to apologize in the most flamboyant voice i could muster up to which she tells me it's fine.  i say to her "oh my god!  i'm sooooooo sorry for staining your blouse, you know those ralph lauren shirts aren't cheap uh huh?"  michelle tells me that she's surprised that i know the brand of her shirt (i knew because i used to date a very fashion-savvy girl who made sure that i knew all the different brands of clothes that she liked, one of them being ralph lauren).  i give michelle a smug sort of look, the kind that let's a woman know that the guy she's talking to is gay.  she understands the look and then starts talking to me like i've never been talked to by a girl before.  our conversation for the next 45 minutes is great and i really start falling for this girl not just for her model-like appearance but her genuinely good nature and personality.  michelle then tells me that "it really sucks that you're gay because you're just the kind of guy that i'm looking for at this school."  i realize that this girl is really into me; it's at this moment that i truly realize that i royally fucked up.  after hasty thinking i spill the beans to michelle, telling her the whole story of the experiment and how i was actually straight and that i was into her too.  her reaction was as expected: she was pissed that i pretended to be gay just to get close to her, called me a creep, and threw her drink in my face, leaving me behind at a party, cold, defeated, and emasculated by the whole ordeal.

    Here is the summary: pretended to be gay around a girl, turns out she liked me, told her i was straight, now she thinks i'm a creep.

    Here is the article: i love working in my basement. most of the times i'm carving something in wood and recently i found my interest in pyrography. so today i went down to my sweet, peaceful, dirty heaven to softly grind my piece of wood.
everything was going fine, i polished 3 quite large slices of birch wood while listening to my favourite "classic metal radio". not gonna lie, i was pretty tired when i finished so started calmly unplug my stuff and back home. i've taken my birch wood and 2 vices to hold the wood. i went out of the basement and brainlessly locked my door. when i hear loud sound of lock locking itself first thing that came into my mind was "fuck, my keys". i was petrified for about 5 seconds and then i assured myself if the keys are behind 5cm (2inch) oak door enhanced with metal bearings all over it.
so i started thinking what the fuck should i do now except screaming every curse word i know in every language of the world in my mind. i looked behind myself and found very old, rusty garden hoe and 2 unused metal pipes for vacuum cleaner. i'm know as the "trust me i'm an engineer" king so i get to work. i've taken a hoe and started doing my best to push up my keys, about a meter away from me. many times i was extremely close so i said in my mind "stay determined...". and finally i did it! the keys fell on the floor. *deep exhale* i thought i will be able to drag them under the door or through the small spaces between the planks. turned out my keys had a little talk with the universe and for some fucking reason flew behind my closet and under the small furnace. time to be petrified again! *another swearwords train in my head*
alright, time to kill the poor door. i took the metal pipe, put it inside the lock and tried to break down the door. the pipe almost broke in the half while the lock was laughing at me, untouched. so i got new idea to break it in few places to make a moon shape pipe so i can reach the keys. also to take them, i broke the wooden hoe and i plugged the ending of the hoe inside the vacuum cleaner pipe. few tries, my keys went just a little bit further so i can no longer even see them. aight, let's get the legendary duct tape. i searched a little and found the toolbox. i took the tape and a hook-like screw. i taped the screw on the edge of the rusty garden hoe pounded to moon-shaped metal vacuum cleaner pipe (sounds like some final fantasy boss). and so i gave it a try. and by some godlike skill i managed to hook the keys on the fuckin hoe blindly on third attempt. i cried a little when i dragged them closer so i could see them. that whole situation irl took about 2 hours or so. luckily i took 2 photos so you can see how the hoe-pipe creature looked like.

my dad and i came home with a lot of stuff. we ended up shopping at home depot, an electronics store, and the supermarket. while unpacking, i found that he had actually gotten that stupid light switch from home depot: a small box that looks like a light switch but when you flick the switch on, the box itself lights up and shines some really bright ass light at your unsuspecting face. i thought, this is hella bright. i wonder how my cat will react. so i shined it to the side, and he looked at it. 

slowly i turned it to face him directly, and slowly he looked away, and then walked away. i thought oh okay, he doesn't like it. probably normal reaction time in comparison to a human looking at something really bright, maybe even a little slower. i would have squinted and looked away sooner, but oh well. 

i'm minding my own business and decide to walk back down the hallway. the minute i take a step i suddenly hear this screaming.

my cat is a rescue but in the month i've had him, i've never seen him look like this. his back was arched and every hair was on end. his hind legs were super tall but his chest was nearly touching the ground, like he was bowing. his eyes were huge and dilated and his ears _faced me_, and he was screaming. it scared the shit out of me, i thought he had rabies or something for a second. then i thought ah, he has to be messing around, right?? because what the fuck is this.

i walked another few steps towards him talking soothingly, but he turned around the corner and hid by the wall. the closer i approached, the louder he got, until his scream deafened me. i swear to god, my ears were ringing. it was fucking scary. my head went blank, all i could do was stand there like a fucking idiot. my dad came out asking what was wrong, i said i didn't know. he said okay, let's step out. we went outside for a minute, talking about what happened... and then we came back in.

cat strolls up to us like nothing just happened. tail high, looking innocent. weird as hell, i don't know what to think and decide to forget it... until we turn around the same corner.

zero to a hundred, he gets all big eyed and back arches, starts screaming again. it was like a nightmare. was he possessed? were we possessed? we didn't know why he was doing this at first and it repeated itself randomly for about three days. we were afraid to come home, afraid to relax, because it would be calm and peaceful and then suddenly bloodcurdling screams from my cat... we were both really paranoid and stiff, even when we sat on the couch or walked anywhere in the house. 

we figured it out soon after. it must have been because i shined the light in his face. he saw spots, probably. like how we do when we stare at the sun, and when he looked at us, we looked like monsters coming to get him and he got scared. he became scared of the corner of the hallway for a while after too, probably because he associated it with the bad thing happening.

    Here is the summary: shined a light at my cat's face, scaring him, which scared us and and continued for three days, making my dad and i paranoid for a week.

    Here is the article: this happened today do i win a prize?  i work at a café it is mostly mind numbing work so when it gets to the end of my 8 hour shift i am normally in autopilot. 

so i'm walking along tending tables and i see a woman holding hands with what i assume to be her child. me being in autopilot ask if she would like a child seat for her kid which is when she then turns around in a split second with the most horrified look on her face as if i just set her house on fire, at this point i snapped out of autopilot, realising that something was up only then seeing what i have done, i look down and see the 'kid' is actually a adult man with dwarfism also with a horrified look. 

it turns out they are a couple that decided to go out for lunch. but i suppose that at least they got it for free in the end. 
i am currently waiting for a call back from my manager to see if i still have a job.
 

edit: just got off the phone and its all good luckily the good manager managed to persuade the other to let me stay on :)

    Here is the article: so this happened last february.

i was walking up the stairs one night and it was dark. my parents were sleeping and for whatever reason i didn't even use my phone light, i was just blindly walking up the stairs, when i tripped over the top step and fell on my knees.

my mom loves stories and videos of people falling, she thinks it's absolutely hilarious. so the next night i'm in the back room of my house talking to her when i decide to tell her the story, and for whatever reason i decide to reenact the fall because i thought she'd find it funny, and i proceed to drop to my knees from a standing position.

mind you, this room we were in has this old, crappy, rough carpeting, and it had been a little while since i trimmed my toenails... yeah gross i know... so as i drop to my knees my feet briefly went into a tip toe position, and the weight and force of my body moving forward dug my right big toenail into the carpet, and once my feet curled back behind me as i landed, the toenail was ripped right out of my toe.

i didn't realize it at first, because i was wearing socks. (yes this somehow happened with socks on). i just felt a massive wave of pain. i'd just assumed i bent my toe bad until minutes later when the pain just got worse and i saw the fucking blood stain materialize on my sock...

now here's where my *absolute monstrous, unhealthy, embarrassing stupidity* comes in. i'm pretty squeamish and i have white coat syndrome, so when i realized my toenail came off i just wrapped a bunch of band-aids around the toe and left it.

lessons learned: cut your fucking toenails and *go to the fucking doctor.* miraculously the nail grew back and it looks like nothing even happened.

    Here is the summary: tried reenacting a fall i took the night before and ended up ripping my toenail off.

    Here is the article: this tifu happened mid week, but had i to wait till the weekend to post.
after a particular heavy night, i woke up the next morning  my member greeting myself in glorious fashion, as usual. needing to deposit some waste of the other variety i went to my bathroom and sat down, i made a very weak attempt at directing my rigid penis below the toilet seat before giving up, completely forgetting what was about to happen due to my tired/hungover state. think you can see where it's going here. as i strained to defecate i unleashed a hot torrent of piss onto my face and chest. i managed to close my mouth quick enough so that only a minor amount entered it but it was still splashing in my eyes and going up my nostrils. it stank. worst thing was because of the temporary anatomy of my penis i couldn't stop the stream so just had to direct it forwards into the hallway cleaned myself off profusely but the memory still haunts me every time my toilet looks at me.

after a particular heavy night, i woke up the next morning  my member greeting myself in glorious fashion, as usual. needing to deposit some waste of the other variety i went to my bathroom and sat down, i made a very weak attempt at directing my rigid penis below the toilet seat before giving up, completely forgetting what was about to happen due to my tired/hungover state. think you can see where it's going here. as i strained to defecate i unleashed a hot torrent of piss onto my face and chest. i managed to close my mouth quick enough so that only a minor amount entered it but it was still splashing in my eyes and going up my nostrils. it stank. worst thing was because of the temporary anatomy of my penis i couldn't stop the stream so just had to direct it forwards into the hallway cleaned myself off profusely but the memory still haunts me every time my toilet looks at me.

    Here is the summary: I woke up with my member greeting myself in glorious fashion, as usual.

    Here is the article: i've recently discovered the camera on my laptop so i've gone on chatroulette a few times. and i haven't been masturbating while on it (i live in close quarters, and i'm not risking getting caught like that) but i'd like to be. anyways, i came across some chick, she wanted me to show her my dick and then she would talk to me on skype.

 i had nothing better to do. so i showed her my flaccid penis. she agreed to talk on skype. i naively thought i'd get to see her tits and then it'd end right there. but she turned out to be a blackmailer, that's right a dark skinned mailman.

 she threatened to share my dick with friends on facebook. i forgot to mention she asked me for my facebook so she could call me on skype, i didn't friend her facebook. up to this point my brain had been blocking all the clear signs that this bitch was gonna fuck me over. well she wants $200. i freaked out at first, but decided to do what i can. so i unfriended my siblings on facebook; they're the only ones i really don't want to find out. deactivated facebook. i  don't think doing any of that actually would've helped though. and so far that's where i'm at right now.

 it happened a couple of hours ago. i like to think that the blackmailer never did it. but i won't know until someone contacts me. no i didn't pay her $200, that's ridiculous.

 

edit: she wanted my facebook so she could call me on skype, not meant to befriend me.

edit dos: it's been over 12 hours from the incident and no one has said anything to me yet, i'm gonna assume i'm in the clear and go on with my life. if you find a usra.jaloa on chatroulette, tell her i'll wait for her

    Here is the summary: showed a blackmailer my dick on chatroulette, she threatened to share it, i let her.

    Here is the article: so, like most things on this sub, this didn't happen today.  it happened roughly 9 years ago when i was in middle school.  this is a throwaway account so that my friends don't ever end up reading this.

&nbsp;  

to make sense of the situation i'm about to recount, i must first explain that in my middle school, a few (maybe 6) 8th graders take geometry at the closest high school early in the morning because we are two years ahead in math and are then taken by a bus back to the middle school (about 5 miles away).  my middle school doesn't start until an hour after the high school, so the few students and myself that take advanced math receive a free period because everyone is in 1st period at the middle school when we arrive and we have already had our 1st period.  

&nbsp;  

one day i was sitting in a conference room in the office with my classmates and they decided to go to the library to type up reports for another class but i had already finished mine.  they all left and so here i was, an 8th grade guy full of hormones, alone in the conference room.  out of anything i could have possibly done, my mind decided it was a good idea to whip out my penis and decide to go to pound town with pamela handerson under the table.  right as i finish, i hear noises coming down the hallway and scramble to attempt to tuck my fleshy joy stick back in my pants and the vice principal walks by.  i was panicking and didn't quite get my pleasure pole put away and was afraid she would notice something was off but she didn't say anything and just smiled and said hello.

&nbsp;  

fast forward two months at graduation and as they call my name up to get a diploma, i go to shake everyone's hand and as i go to shake my vice principal's hand, she leans in and says "remember to not leave the used tissues on the table next time."  reddit, i think this is the closest i've ever been to throwing up out of embarrassment.  thankfully, i never had a reason to return to that school but to this day i have no idea why she didn't decide to turn me in and suspend or expel me.

&nbsp;

    Here is the summary: decided to get frisky with myself under a conference table in middle school, vice principal passes by and ends up telling me months later at graduation that she saw me.

now, i'm a fairly awkward, yet not bad looking guy (6.5/10) and i got my friend to blackmail me into asking out a girl (we'll call her mary)

having finally summoned a pair of balls from the deepest regions of my mind, i feebly say to her as class is ending: 
"can i talk to you after class?"

so we wait outside of class and once everyone else has left us alone for me to stumble across the minefield of romance, i say to her:
"so, umm, you know how last week people said i like you? well... it's true." 

a shocked silence from both of us at that bombshell; it enveloped the atmosphere like a cock blocking greenhouse gas.

mary: "umm, ok."

now, dear redditors, the line i'm about to convey to you will go down in the annals of history as one of the greatest lines to ever be conjured by the human brain. how could she resist me after i deliver this astoundingly attractive line:

"so, ah, is it *mutual*?"
 
yes, i realise that i'm an utter idiot. so did my friend when i told him of my romantic escapade.

now, dear redditors, the line i'm about to convey to you will go down in the annals of history as one of the greatest lines to ever be conjured by the human brain. how could she resist me after i deliver this astoundingly attractive line:

"so, ah, is it *mutual*?"
 
yes, i realise that i'm an utter idiot. so did my friend when i told him of my romantic escapade.

    Here is the summary: I'm a fairly awkward, yet not bad looking guy (6.5/10) and i got my friend to blackmail me into asking out a girl (we'll call her mary)

    You will be given one summary written for a news article. Your task is to rate the summary based on the following criteria:
    Output format: PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE

    Evaluation Criteria:
    1. Read the news article carefully and identify the main topic and key points.
    2. Read the summary and compare it to the news article. Check if the summary covers the main topic and key points of the news article, and if it resents them in a clear and logical order.
    3. Rate the summary with 5 percentages, where each one represents how likely the summary is going to get a score from 1 to 5. For example, if you think the summary is 80% likely to get a score of 5, 10% likely to get a score of 4, 5% likely to get a score of 3, 3% likely to get a score of 2, and 1% likely to get a score of 1, you should rate the summary as 80, 10, 5, 3, 2.

    Here is the article: actually, this is my dad's fuck up, but i was present and had to deal with his meltdown.

my dad is a truck guy.  he is retired, and for fun spends his time at a junk yard helping an even older guy clear out his decade's old junk pile in the middle of the woods. it's a long story, but it's literally a place that has trees growing up through the frames of ancient vehicles.

so anyway.  my dad has a 90's chevy blazer.  he wanted a trailer hitch, and found one in the yard.  at my house today, he took off his bumper and attached the trailer hitch.  unfortunately, the truck he took the hitch off of was slightly different from his, so the bumper doesn't fit.  no problem!  just have to get the other bumper!

here's the fuck up.  he came in my house to eat some pizza.  i had told him i had some zip ties to attach the plate to the trailer hitch in the mean time.  while eating pizza, i found out i was mistaken and did not have the zip ties.  again, no problem.  we were heading to the car parts store to return a rented tool anyway.

we jump in the truck and gaily drive away.  we arrive at the car parts store and i get the zip ties. 

my dad goes to attach the plate.

the plate is nowhere to be found. 

turns out he had laid the plate on top of the trailer hitch with the understanding that he would come right back out to attach it after pizza.  

i live in the woods.  so many twists and turns were made on the way to the store.  we drove back looking carefully.  well, i looked carefully.  my dad drove fast and was freaking out about having the truck impounded the entire time. 

did not find the plate.  got home and inspected my driveway and the road around it. still no plate.  it has disappeared.  i am going to take a walk tomorrow (in what has been forecast to be torrential rain) to see if i can find it. 

i've also called the police dept to report the missing plate and he will go to the dmv on monday.  in the mean time, he's gonna stoke out any time now.  

fyi - we live in ri, which is a state which requires a plate on both front and back.  i tried to convince him to put the front plate on the back, but he is too freaked out to accept any thing other than the plate back in pristine condition.

 

edit for properity - found the plate!

i walked about half a mile in the sprinkling rain to find it. it was upside down right there on the side of the road.  as i picked it up, i stood there with the aluminum plate in my hand and heard thunder crack overhead.  

thankfully, i got my dad to pick me before this became a worse tifu

    Here is the summary: accidentally abandoned a loyal license plate due to delicious pizza.

    Here is the article: i am currently a student paying my way through undergrad by working two jobs and a decent amount of scholarships and financial aid. i live off campus so my financial aid ends up being less than my school charges me because i don't get charged for housing and i'm not required to have a meal plan. the way my school deals with it is i can request a refund for the difference and then i can use that to help pay for rent and food. so, in september i got the bill and subtracted the amount i was charged for from the amount my aid covers and submitted a refund for the difference. after about a month i finally got the check and i started getting emails saying that my e-bill was ready. i basically ignored those because i figured it was just updating me with the fact that my balance was zero. it kept emailing me saying that i still hadn't checked my e-bill so i finally checked it this morning to appease the automated billing system. lo and behold, my math was off at some point and i accidentally requested $300 more than i was covered for so my account actually had a balance. also, because i've been ignoring it for a month now, there's also a $100 late fee.

    Here is the summary: requested my financial aid check, math'ed wrong, and now i owe the school $400.

    Here is the article: this happened about a year ago during my finals. everything was going fine, i was studying, and doing fairly well on my exams, i was always on time, and always prepared for whatever. 
well, not exactly, turns out i should've focused a bit more on the exam schedule.
my school has this weird thing where they put the exam dates for 8th 9th and 10th grade on the same schedule but on different columns, and by some miracle, the exam order for 9th and 10th grade was exactly the same, well, except for the last 2 sessions. 
and that's a problem because i always looked at the 9th grade order, not the 10th, so one day, when i thought i had a free day to chill and catch up, i get a call from my angry and obviously rushing mother to get dressed as i missed out on half of my business exam, i get a strange look in my face and question the sanity of such a statement before looking at the schedule, really looking, and realizing my fuck-up. i paled on ran around like a crazy chicken, putting on my school uniform, making myself look presentable and studying all at the same time.
i had only done one 20 page chapter, and had another 3, each longer than the last, i had at most, 15 minutes. 
in those 15 minutes i went into an adrenaline based rapid super study mode while simultaneously praying to weird deities i invented, like time-reversoro and unfuckitupit. 
my calls went un-answered and i went into the exam nearly blind. as i entered school premises i rushed into the filled classroom like a madman, my eyes sweeping over the room as my disheveled panting figure grabbed everyone's attention, their eyes followed me as i sat down and rapidly wrote some scientific gibberish on my paper, i relied on my memory completely and likely siphoned every possible detail i could think of. 
thankfully, i passed. 
and got the highest grade in class. 
which admittedly, wasn't that high, and got me into a ton of trouble, still, its some form of achievement right?

    Here is the summary: subconsciously thought i was a ninth grader (while in 10th) and nearly missed one of my main final exams (business).

    Here is the article: obligatory this happened about two years ago.

i was camping, and me and my family were toasting marshmellows. me and my little brother were making them as hot as possible by putting them in the core of the fire. mine began to caramelize, and even set on fire at one point. i pulled it out of the fire, and noticed it was falling off my stick a little. this is where i fucked up. i instinctively put my hand under to catch it, and the pain i felt was worse than breaking my leg. the marshmellow was in white hot flame for about 2 minutes, so it could have been about 800-1000 celcius. my fingers were puffing up, and practically started melting. i should mention that i was camping in the middle of wales, with the nearest hospital about 1.5 hours away; so i decided to suck it up. after 6 hours of searing agony, i got my mum to drive me to the hospital. i put my fingers in front of a -20 celcius air con fan for the entire way, and began to feel better. my fingernail has permanent damage in that it has a sharp drop on one side, and it is bordering on ingrown.

    Here is the summary: i put my finger under a caramelizing marshmellow by mistake, causing permanent damage to my finger.

i was camping, and me and my family were toasting marshmellows. me and my little brother were making them as hot as possible by putting them in the core of the fire. mine began to caramelize, and even set on fire at one point. i pulled it out of the fire, and noticed it was falling off my stick a little. this is where i fucked up. i instinctively put my hand under to catch it, and the pain i felt was worse than breaking my leg. the marshmellow was in white hot flame for about 2 minutes, so it could have been about 800-1000 celcius. my fingers were puffing up, and practically started melting. i should mention that i was camping in the middle of wales, with the nearest hospital about 1.5 hours away; so i decided to suck it up. after 6 hours of searing agony, i got my mum to drive me to the hospital. i put my fingers in front of a -20 celcius air con fan for the entire way, and began to feel better. my fingernail has permanent damage in that it has a sharp drop on one side, and it is bordering on ingrown.

    Here is the article: this fuck up actually happened today.

i'm at a sit down restaurant with my friend. we are both white. he brings up the topic of the confederate flag debate that the united states is going through at the moment (which shouldn't be a debate, btw. they lost). 

unbeknownst to be, as i am sitting facing away from the booth behind me, two black men are seated as my friend and i are having this discussion.

this is where i fuck up. somewhat loudly, i say to my friend, "for all the bad things that flag represents, you gotta admit it's a beautifully designed flag."

at this point my friend has gone silent and motions to look behind me, which i do, and i see the two black men at the table behind me giving me a disgusted look. i go on to say something that i think will help me: "oh, i'm not racist, but, i just think it's a very pretty flag."

black guy shakes his head and turns around. they ask to be moved to another table. i lost my appetite. i hate being a non-racist racist sometimes.

 


edit: i thought i'd [link to cgp grey's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulbcuhipngu) that he just uploaded about the confederate flag to add to discussion.

"oh, fuck." i think. but no problem, because we have two cars and he can take the other one, right? wrong. the car to which keys i accidentally took when i ran back into the house the first time were the car keys, my dad later gave me my own keys. that car was blocking the second car in the drive. my dad shows up to work two hours late, gets humiliated by his supervisor, and almost fired. luckily, he was given a first warning because he never shows up late. 

 

edit: some people are getting confused by my story. my dad works in a hospital and there is no excuse for being late unless it's something like a car accident, death in family, etc. mostly everything has to be called in for. my dad works in the emergency room department so they always need people to be working.

    Here is the article: my iphone, like many iphones, has the ability for slow motion videos. i've used it before to catch flaws in my workouts / varying lifts or to just be silly. stupid slow motion videos are really funny to me.

today, i was messing around with facebook's new "upload a gif" feature and i wanted to see if i could upload slow motion videos. i took a few and watched them whilst giggling hysterically. a thought came over me. if my face looks that funny bouncing around in slow motion, how would my flaccid donger look?

for science.

with the help of my girlfriend, i framed the shot and sat about getting the lighting. i pulled down my pants and displayed my fuzzy man-caterpillar rolled out to his inch-and-a-half of glory. i then flopped like i'd never flopped before. men of reddit - you know what i'm talking about.

it was at the start of the flopping that i realized my mistake. i startled my 5 year old corgi who leapt at me with the full force of his 30 lb. frame and attempted to gnosh down on the offending trouser snake.

i now have a slow motion video of my corgi leaping for my donger which is complete with slow motion screams of terror. you can actually see my penis recede another inch or two in complete fear.

i am not a smart man.

    Here is the article: * i made a throwaway account, because on my main account, i know you can find out who i am, and i don't want my youngest sister knowing that i posted this online.  i just want to vent a bit, because, i fucked up

well, it wasn't today, it was two days ago on friday around 10pm or so when my older brother called, my older brother has been a big family issue for the last couple years because of a huge family issue that was revealed around in december/january of 2013/2014, but i will get to that in a bit.

after i got out of work, my sisters picked me up from work, and let me know that my older brother was calling multiple times trying to talk to me, they didn't know what he wanted me to talk about to him, but, they wanted me to talk to have him stop calling nonstop.

around 10pm or so, he called, and he wanted me to talk to his son and daughter, to see how they were doing and everything, i talked two his daughter, and she was very lively in talking to me, and we talked about her schoolwork, what she did over the summer and other things, while his son was super shy, and didn't want to talk at all.  

after i talked to them for a while, my brother got back on and asked me if my sisters or my nephews(my sisters nephews who were living with us) wanted to talk to them.  one of my nephews was up, and my youngest sister was still up.

* before i get into the next part of the story, i want to give some backstory to the huge family issues we have been having for the last two years.

* before i start the backstory, i going to talk a tiny bit on my family, so you have an idea who i am talking about. 

there is my oldest sister(the "cult leader" who is not a cult leader at all), my oldest brother(the most fucked up person of the family), my older brother(the person i am talking about above, and the real asshole), myself(the idiot), and my youngest sister(the victim here)

in october of 2013, my oldest brother, was having a wedding, with his girlfriend of about five years, and we were invited to his wedding, so we took two weeks off and went on a road trip and visit many states and checked out cool landmarks on the way.  but, something during this trip triggered a very dark and messed up memory in my youngest sister's mind, which, took a while before she remember the whole story, which, the brother who was having his wedding, back when my sister was ten, molested her and maybe even raped her.

i don't know why he did, but it might of been connected to our father's passing in 2000.  i do not know the details and do not want to know them at all either, but in 2014, my sister confronted my oldest brother, and he confirmed he, that really did happen, and she is not remembering something that wasn't real.  also our mother basically toss the thing under the rug and my youngest sister pushed that memory into the back of her mind.

basically, after a while, my sister basically called back where we used to live(where the "rape") happen and charged my brother with statutory raped with a minor(she was 10 years old at the time), but because of the budget of the state/county of where we used to live where it happen, they couldn't send out an officer to go to where he lives and arrest him, so this pissed off my sister a lot knowing that he getting off free because they won't send someone to arrest him.

also, my brother knows that there is warrent out for his arrest, and has cut all contact from his family because of it, even thought he was "sorry" for what he did back then.  i haven't heard from him since then.

but, the backstory is not over yet, a little after the wedding, there were rumors going on that my oldest brother has gotten his wife pregnant, which, was the main factor on my youngest sister of putting out a warrant for his arrest, because he didn't want that child to have happen to her to happen to it.  after that, it was confirmed he was pregnant, but after the news of her husband raped her youngest sister when she was ten, she either had it aborted or she lost it because of the stress of the news or something, i do not know how she lost it.

* now, for some of my older brothers backstory.  after the news broke out between the family members(my sisters, brothers and i) my older brother for some reason tried controlling the issue in the family, which wasn't his issue to control, like he didn't want my sister to tell our aunts and uncles about the news, but for some reason, he went around her and was the one that told them, which pissed of my sister like no tomorrow, and other things that happen during the issue.  

during the time this was happening, my youngest sister was seeing a psychologist, and they said to not give out any more info to the family, except to people living in the household(myself, herself, our oldest sister and her nephews) so my older brother couldn't wouldn't know what is going, which caused him to get pissed, and being more demanding, and trying to say if you don't tell him what is going on, he wouldn't let her talk or see his kids anymore, which made her even more pissed, and basically made her just hate him.

basically there were multiple issues that my older brother blaims my youngest sister for, a couple are: making us lose a brother, blaiming her for the death of his brother's unborn child, and tons of other things she hates him for because of it.

* back to the main story, i go out to the living room and ask my sister if she wanted to talk to my older brothers kids at all, which she was extremely against and did not want to talk, so i told my older brother that she was doing homework and couldn't talk(i lied so make her seem busy), and went to go ask my nephew if he wanted to talk.

but, he went to sleep during the time i asking my sister about that, and them my sister yelled at me staying they had to goto bed early because they needed to do something in the morning, which for some reason made my brother believe she wasn't doing homework, and was avoiding him, so he told me that he would his daughter on the phone, and he wouldn't be even near it.  

then, i asked my sister again, and she was extreme pissed that i asked that again, even thought i told her that it was his daughter on the phone, and he wasn't going to be part of the call at all, she said no i don't want to talk, and wouldn't changed her mind, and i became flustered, and i said to my older brother's daughter that "she did not want to talk to her right now", which i relies what i was saying and i changed it to "she was busy right now", and my sister overheard me saying that, and gave me a very angry look while i went back to my room.

so, i told her to give back the phone to my brother, which my brother was pissed, and went on a rant saying that she is playing the victim and why doesn't see want to talk to them and stuff, after he ranted for a while, we say goodbye to each other, and he wanted my cell number so he can talk to me without dealing with my house phone(because my sisters do not want to answer it when he is calling) and then went to the living room where my sister was at.  

she told me that she did not want even talk to his kids while he was around, because that was his way of getting to her and his oldest sister, using his kids as pawn to try to pry in matters that did not matter to him.  she also said that she hated him for everything that he said after the whole issue i explained above, and she was even more pissed at me for saying to her niece that she did not want to talk to her, even thought she really do want to talk to her and her nephew too, but, she knowns that her brother uses them to ask her stuff, and he listens who that she is saying to them, and such.  if he didn't call and his wife did, my sister would gladly talk to his kids if he wasn't around. 

i told her that i told her that out frustration i said that to her niece by accident and i did not mean to say that, but, she didn't care, she was angry with me because i said that to her niece.  after this all happen she poured the everything on why she hates her older brother because of the family issue, and then started crying, which i left her alone after that, and listen to some sigur ros (their () album) to help calm me down and i went to sleep afterwards.

the next day, when i went to work i got a text from my older brother asking if my nephews are free to talk to his kids now, and said i was at work so i don't know. after i got out of work, and my oldest sister found out about last night from her youngest sister and we had a long talk about last night and everything, and we thought everything was going to be fine.

but, for some reason my older brother called again, asking if my nephews wanted to talk to his son and daughter.  but, because of the big fight that happen last night, i didn't want to talk to my brother, because i was pissed off because of the fight, and didn't want to deal with him at all after what happen.  well, this for some reason pissed off my brother, and because of it, made him think my oldest sister was controlling me in some way, which she is not.  i wanted to rest after a long day of work, and didn't want to deal with it.  

after a while my brother was getting super pissed, and demand i talk to him, because he believes my sister is controlling me like some type of cult leader, and is controlling me to doing what is best for the family and won't let me do things because of various reasons. he believes that i won't drive, go to college, or various others things because she wouldn't let me do them, but the real reason is because i did not want to do them, or i was lazy as fuck, she is not controlling me in any way.

finally, i talked to him saying to him that i didn't want to talk to him because i was tired from work, and because a issue from last night, that i didn't want to talk about yet.  he was very pushy and wanted me to talk about it, and i said not now, but he wouldn't leave it alone, so i hung up on him, then he was texting me saying my oldest sister was a cult leader, and was going to tell his wife about this and everything and i turned off my phone so i wouldn't get 5000 messages from him.  

after this whole issue, i talked to my sisters and i wanted to explain to my older brother on why my youngest sister had a huge deal on friday night, but they said it would be a very bad idea, and they said don't talk about it, but they said if i want to reveal to him it, they would be fine with it, but my youngest sister said that he might retaliate against my oldest sister because of it, and she doesn't want her to deal with this because it being close to her birthday and everything.

and that is the story up to now, my older brother hasn't contacted me in the past day or so, but, i don't know what to say to him, because i don't want to hurt my oldest sister at all, but i do want him to know why my sister was like that the other night, i don't know what do, but i will figure something out.

* thanks for reading this guys, i will try to post more when there is more info to spread around and everything, thanks.

    Here is the article: * i made a throwaway account, because on my main account, i know you can find out who i am, and i don't want my youngest sister knowing that i posted this online.  i just want to vent a bit, because, i fucked up

well, it wasn't today, it was two days ago on friday around 10pm or so when my older brother called, my older brother has been a big family issue for the last couple years because of a huge family issue that was revealed around in december/january of 2013/2014, but i will get to that in a bit.

after i got out of work, my sisters picked me up from work, and let me know that my older brother was calling multiple times trying to talk to me, they didn't know what he wanted me to talk about to him, but, they wanted me to talk to have him stop calling nonstop.

around 10pm or so, he called, and he wanted me to talk to his son and daughter, to see how they were doing and everything, i talked two his daughter, and she was very lively in talking to me, and we talked about her schoolwork, what she did over the summer and other things, while his son was super shy, and didn't want to talk at all.  

after i talked to them for a while, my brother got back on and asked me if my sisters or my nephews(my sisters nephews who were living with us) wanted to talk to them.  one of my nephews was up, and my youngest sister was still up.

* before i get into the next part of the story, i want to give some backstory to the huge family issues we have been having for the last two years.

* before i start the backstory, i going to talk a tiny bit on my family, so you have an idea who i am talking about. 

there is my oldest sister(the "cult leader" who is not a cult leader at all), my oldest brother(the most fucked up person of the family), my older brother(the person i am talking about above, and the real asshole), myself(the idiot), and my youngest sister(the victim here)

in october of 2013, my oldest brother, was having a wedding, with his girlfriend of about five years, and we were invited to his wedding, so we took two weeks off and went on a road trip and visit many states and checked out cool landmarks on the way.  but, something during this trip triggered a very dark and messed up memory in my youngest sister's mind, which, took a while before she remember the whole story, which, the brother who was having his wedding, back when my sister was ten, molested her and maybe even raped her.

i don't know why he did, but it might of been connected to our father's passing in 2000.  i do not know the details and do not want to know them at all either, but in 2014, my sister confronted my oldest brother, and he confirmed he, that really did happen, and she is not remembering something that wasn't real.  also our mother basically toss the thing under the rug and my youngest sister pushed that memory into the back of her mind.

basically, after a while, my sister basically called back where we used to live(where the "rape") happen and charged my brother with statutory raped with a minor(she was 10 years old at the time), but because of the budget of the state/county of where we used to live where it happen, they couldn't send out an officer to go to where he lives and arrest him, so this pissed off my sister a lot knowing that he getting off free because they won't send someone to arrest him.

also, my brother knows that there is warrent out for his arrest, and has cut all contact from his family because of it, even thought he was "sorry" for what he did back then.  i haven't heard from him since then.

but, the backstory is not over yet, a little after the wedding, there were rumors going on that my oldest brother has gotten his wife pregnant, which, was the main factor on my youngest sister of putting out a warrant for his arrest, because he didn't want that child to have happen to her to happen to it.  after that, it was confirmed he was pregnant, but after the news of her husband raped her youngest sister when she was ten, she either had it aborted or she lost it because of the stress of the news or something, i do not know how she lost it.

* now, for some of my older brothers backstory.  after the news broke out between the family members(my sisters, brothers and i) my older brother for some reason tried controlling the issue in the family, which wasn't his issue to control, like he didn't want my sister to tell our aunts and uncles about the news, but for some reason, he went around her and was the one that told them, which pissed of my sister like no tomorrow, and other things that happen during the issue.

if things had happened as they should be, i would have gone for groceries on my way back. so, we went back together and stopped by a pet shop. (un)fortunately, it was lunch time, so closed. 

it smelled weird on our parking lot, when i put the key in the door my two dogs came outside with a cloud of smoke: the couch was burning hard. after a while, we did stop the fire. 

after checking on the dogs, we took the couch out and saw what started this mess: the dog had chewed up a lipo battery, cause that's obviously the best thing to do when the masters are outside.

lesson learned, don't fuck up with lipo batteries... put them in a real safe place and in a lipo safe bag. my house could have burned today...

    Here is the article: this actually happened this past winter but man, it was a fuck up.

i was working a grocery store job.  i was a little concerned about getting sick and having to call out because there was a nasty stomach bug going around, and my son had it only a few days ago.  however, at this point i feel like i dodged the bullet.

so, i'm working an evening shift, and i head to the break room to take my break.  i had leftover "tater tot surprise."  i also had a cup of coffee, because i love me some coffee.

after this, things... changed.  there was this subtle jabbing pain in the pit of my stomach, as if i had indigestion.  no big deal, i probably just ate too fast or drank too much coffee.  i go to help unload a freight truck and the jabbing gets worse, and then... it started.  that queasy, insidious, gross sensation of being nauseous.  i'm still praying that i had just had too much coffee or something, but it continued to build.  finally i turned to one of my co-workers and said "dude, at some point tonight i'm gonna throw up, i can feel it."  he asked if i needed to sit down and have a glass of water and i said no, it's probably a bug, but i am going to try and finish out my shift.

unloading the truck and stocking shelves became more and more difficult as my stomach continued to churn.  after an hour it was just moment after unbearable moment and i realized i simply could not do this anymore.  i went to the freight supervisor and said "i am so sorry but i cannot do this for you, i am going to be sick."  she had a deer in the headlights look and said "well, okay, just let the front manager know."

i went to the front end manger and said i needed to leave right now, because i was going to be sick.  she said "okay, do you think you can pull and count your drawer first?"  i had been running a spare cash register earlier.  i agreed, because it was an extra fifteen minutes pay for sitting down, no big deal right?

i take my drawer into the office.  at this point my entire experience of reality itself is colored by a wall of gross nausea.  i sit down and start counting, and after a minute i am literally doubled over clenching my stomach, counting with my other hand.

i was about to blow my friggin cookies.

i called the front end manager in.  once she stepped through the door i bolted.  no explanation about the half-counted money.  i just ran.

now here's where i fucked up-- there was a small trash can by the door of the office.  i thought very briefly about grabbing it on my way out but i didn't.  i figured that stopping and puking in a little trash can would be embarrassing, which is funny considering how things turned out.

the bathrooms were about a hundred feet away, through the grocery back stock room.  i'm half running, half power walking.  my stomach is screaming.  with only twenty feet to go, my stomach had had enough, and the first wave of dinner went to the top.  i clenched my mouth shut but **it shot out my nose** and traveled several feet across the room, leaving a line of delectable tater tots and corn all along the floor.  it turns out, this particular virus was known for causing projectile vomiting, or as one of my friends called it, power puking.

now, my nose is on fire and i can see the bathrooms only ten feet away, but my stomach has already gone into full evacuation mode, and no force on heaven or earth could stop it.  i lunged towards the door, and as i did so, my abdomen wrenched and another round of dinner flew out of my mouth.  it pretty much covered the entire door from eye-level down.

at this point i had given up all hope of containing my stomach.  someone was going to have to clean up a mess whether they liked it or not.  i shoved the door open and had a split-second decision-- the sink, the urinal, or the toilet.  the toilet was in the far corner of the room, so that was out of the question.  the sink was right next to me, but it would be impossible to clean.  so... the urinal.

my abdomen wretched and i just fell to my knees and let it happen.  i have never seen so much food fly out of my mouth in so little time.  the wretches were excruciating, and i made this loud primal moan with each one.  this was loud enough for folks outside to hear, and a group of confused and disgusted co-workers gathered outside the puke-covered door.

in the end, i had spewed vomit over everything except the urinal.  i think maybe one piece of corn made it in there.  otherwise i had basically trashed the place with my own bodily fluids.

i attempted to start cleaning the mess but the front manager came in and said no, go home, don't worry about coming in tomorrow.  i was fucking humiliated because now everyone and their brother would know about the guy who power-puked all over the men's bathroom.

my pants and shirt were covered with puke.  i wiped myself down as best as i could and left without punching out.  this was in new england during that polar vortex, so it was a toasty -10f when i walked to my car, which i had not had time to start.  the wet pukey-ness froze to my clothes and i shivered and chattered and moaned all the way home.  i'm surprised i didn't cause an accident.

i went in the door without even saying hi to my so, i just basically said that i puked all over myself and needed a shower.  when i got to the bathroom, i realized i was too weak to stand up under hot water for any length of time, so i curled up in the tub while the shower was going.  thus began a long and very miserable night where i almost had to go to the er for moderate dehydration, since i could not even keep a sip of water down.

    Here is the summary: got nauseous at work, ran to the bathroom, blew my friggin cookies all over everything except the toilet.

    Here is the article: so, this happened last year. 

i work in reality tv production. on this particular show (signed a nda, sorry) we were following doctors in a hospital during their residencies. the hospital we filmed in was a huge, multi-building hospital that spanned a couple of blocks. we had a tech room set up in one of the off shoot wings that wasn't the er or main part of the hospital, but it was an administrative building/working ward of the place as a whole. 

now, when you work on set for twelve plus hours a day, it's inevitable you're going to have to take a dump at some point. i'm not really that bathroom shy, but i normally like to find a remote, slightly low traffic bathroom to drop the kids off at the pool. around day three, one of the cam ops tells me he's found the holy grail of bathrooms that's super close to the tech room, and man he wasn't joking. this bathroom was the cadillac of bathrooms. one toilet, one urinal, the door locked so you could have the entire bathroom to yourself, and it was about the size of my apartment living room. it was awesome. for about two months, our unit's camera dept. and another unit's camera dept. we had enlightened were all deucing it up in this amazing bathroom. 

one day, we had to follow one of the cast members on her rotation in a ward none of us had filmed in yet. we met her in the parking lot, did a quick otf, and followed her into the building she was starting her rotation in. when she hit the floor, she started suiting up into this sort of bio-hazard outer layer protection gear. mask, disposable plastic covering, gloves, the whole nine. that's when we found out she was doing rotations in the infectious diseases ward. what evs, we knew what we had signed up for, no big deal. the crew following her into the rooms suited up also, and we started shooting her doing her rounds. about two hours into filming, i realized i had to make a run to the tech room to do a battery swap, and asked the field producer if she knew where the tech room was located in relation to our position. she told me it was super close. just go down the hall, take a right, then take my first left, and it was through the double doors. i quickly walk down the hall, take the first right, and..... it hits me. this hallway looks familiar. i take the first left, and sure enough, there is the door leading to our amazing bathroom. right smack in the middle of the infectious disease ward. 

i already have a few hypochondriac tendencies, but this took freaking out to a whole new level. for the next couple of weeks, every mosquito bite was mrsa. i was convinced, somehow, i was going to catch the flesh eating disease. hoof to mouth, every single strain of hepatitis, monkeypox, rickets, rocky mountain spotted fever.... i now have god damned aids from taking a comfortable shit! web md didn't help to alleviate any of my fears, but it's been a year and none of the crew members, including myself, have come down with anything. i guess the take away from this is always be aware of your surroundings.

    Here is the article: this happened less than 24 hours ago. so a week ago i started rewatching one punch man. it is an anime about this really overpowered character who is the strongest being in the universe and can kill everything with one punch basically.

 i finished the season yesterday and was really pumped up because it was so fun to watch and the final battle as they played the main theme song during it.

being a filthy weeb, i started singing along with the song while punching the air like the main character did. at the climax of the battle  the main character saitama throws a very strong punch. anyone who has watched the final episode  knows which punch i tried imitating that broke my hand. my desk is right next to the wall so i proceeded to punch the wall as hard as i could. don't ask how but i somehow forgot the wall was there

after i hit the wall my hand was in immense pain and i started cursing at the world. i thought that it was just a simple injury but after an hour of the pain not going away and my hand starting to swell i decided to go to a walk-in doctor.

he told me that he thought i had broken my knuckle and recommended i go to the local hospital to get an x-ray. a few hours later it was confirmed that my hand was broken and i got a cast. i just came home and i'm not sure how to tell friends and family that i broke my hand by watching anime. i'm stupid. i know.

    Here is the article: so this happened around 8 years ago.

my family and i were vacationing in florida and we decided to visit an uncle of mine who i'd never met before. my mom always spoke highly of him so in my mind i saw him as that really cool uncle.

so we get to his house and as i do during most family reunions, i greet people and sit on the couch. my uncle must have noticed i was bored because he offered me his computer to play some games on. i accepted, of course, and he brought me to the computer room.

after playing for a couple of hours i clicked the little star at the top of the browser for "favorites". then i clicked around like little kids do. suddenly the computer starts lagging and i'm afraid i broke it. ten seconds later the screen fills up entirely with like 10 different windows of  hardcore porn. i'm terrified so i just sprint out and tell my mom and dad. i probably sounded like i was just babbling nonsense, so they laugh it off and slowly make their way to the computer while i'm close to tears. their smiles fade when they see / hear what's happening on the monitor.

family reunions are still awkward to this day.

    Here is the article: this just happened about a hour ago, and i'll just make it short. so here where i live, its the autumn is starting to already have effects, and the recent line of storms and a hurricane here on the east coast knocked a bunch of leaves and dead branches on my yard. i gathered them into a pile two days ago, and i got the idea today to light the pile on fire, because i wanted to test the idea of a hairspray flamethrower. now this is where i fu, i hold the hairspray and the lighter, and spray it towards the pile. i laughed for a moment, then i noticed there was a hole on the side of the pile. the fire which already engulfed the pile, i then begin to hear skittering noises, and for a moment i nearly had a heart attack, because when i looked at the hole some more, there were these 3 small things crawling out, and were on fire. i then noticed how they looked like raccoon babies. by the time i got some water, they were burnt to a crisp, and it was too late. i dug a hole and buried them there. worse part was i noticed the raccoon mother came back, and i could hear it calling out to the babies as it circled the half burnt pile of sticks and leaves.

    Here is the summary: I gathered the leaves and dead branches into a pile two days ago.

    Here is the article: this, unlike most tifus, happened about 5 seconds ago.
so i used to exercise regularly and pretty well, had a recommended home regime designed and the whole shebang. however, i had an accident a little while ago and stopped exercising; cue the weight gain, lethargy and feelings of laziness etc. so today something possessed me, and i decided fuck demotivation, i was getting back into my regime and healthy lifestyle.
got my music going went through my warmup in my head, and i'm feeling good, so i go ahead and start, pumped with motivation and pretty headless.
now i have wooden panelling in my bedroom, and somehow i figured it was okay to work out in a t shirt and no shoes on, on my carpet covering the floor, because of course it and the mat are interchangeable.
this is where the fuck up begins: uneven panels + carpet hiding them + working out with weight i'm not used to = falling and somehow managing to twist my ankle so much i can't walk, so yayy. combine this with the fact that i'm going to a standing concert tomorrow, btw.
honestly, i'm just hoping reddit gets a laugh out of this now, because even i'm amused at my own stupidity.

    Here is the summary: exercised on uneven wooden panels and carpet, fell, twisted my ankle to swelling point. can't walk now, and learnt that exercise guidelines are there for a reason, apparently

    Here is the article: we were having a great time and it was actually quite amazing since this is the first time i actually learnt (after so much experimenting) how to give a blowjob right. it sure might not be difficult for some but it took some tries for me. i was so happy. it just somehow came naturally yesterday. i did it perfectly and he was dizzy with happiness. happy hormones dancing in both of us.

much to our discomfort, we were soon interrupted in the middle of it. i was really excited i could finally do it and perhaps i rejoiced too fast. never [ever] take great pleasure in doing something before it's done. once the intrusion was gone, we got comfortable again and now a really excited me sucked again. this time, however, without any warning, before i could turn my head, absolutely unintentional, without a moment's alarm or forewarning, my stomach rolled and rumbled and let out an avalanche of puke. i puked on his cock and his balls. i turned my head immediately and took it in my hands. a second too late though.

i then exploded into an avalanche of apologies. but lucky for me, he wasn't weirded out. on the contrary, he kept apologizing as well, asking me if i was alright and worrying about my health. we cleaned up. this could easily have been one of the most agonizing memories till date had he not been so mature and understanding about it and laughed it off with me. so we basically went on with our lives feeling grateful we had each other and laughing at the randomness and preposterous vomits in life.

if he ever reads this post- thank you for being so nice. you're a gem. :)

    Here is the article: this actually happened last weekend, and i feel that i need to preface that i am a 28 year old female and i have camped many times, but i always make sure to have a potty nearby because my biggest fear is what happened. 

i live in idaho and it's been 100 degrees every day for like a month and a half. some friends and i decide to go down to the river and hang out, play with the dogs, whatever. before we left i kinda had to poo but i couldn't do it, it was more of a "i'm gonna have to go eventually" kind of thing. 

so we go to a part of the river that i've never been to, you have to walk some trails to get down there. so we get there and i jump in right away cause i've had to pee forever and it's the river, that's what you do. about 7 minutes after that i realize that i have to go. i think to myself that i can hold it, i just have to get out of the water for a bit. so i go sit down and realize this is not one of those moments, this is a monster that has to get out of me. 

so i get out of the water and start walking back towards the trails. one of my friends asks where i'm going an i have to go so bad i just say "illberightback!" as fast as possible, cause losing focus on this means i will for sure have feces in my swimsuit.

i get back to the main trail and start walking along, trying to find a place where there is a log or something that i can squat over that is also not in the view of people, but it gets so bad that i just said "fuck it" and found the closest log available. i am so lucky that there happens to be a whole dug already, so all i have to do is squat down and sit on the log.
 
this is where the problem occurs. i have a soaking wet swimsuit on, that is a pain in the ass to get off, and when i get down ready to go, i panic. my butt is like "nope nope nope" when it touches the log and i panic. so while my body was ready to free this beast, my brain was like "abort!"

so it starts to go and i am stuck in this almost kneeling position on the ground and i don't know what to do cause i can't stop myself from pooping. so i just let it go, and i lost my balance and ended up shatting on my foot. it was warm and as disgusting as you could imagine. i was annoyed and grossed out and panicky at that moment, but nothing prepared me for what came next: i had nothing to wipe with. i look around for leaves or a stick or something, anything to end this, and then i start to think "what if those leaves are poisonous? what if the stick gives me splinters? i don't want splinters in my butthole." 

luckily i happen to have a shirt on over my swimsuit, so i begrudgingly take it off and wipe myself with it. i then threw it in the whole, and buried the entire remnants of the horrific situation at hand. 
then i had the matter of getting the poo off me. instead of going back and facing my friends, i walked further down the trail to find a place more secluded than where we were. i hope in the river and start washing myself off as best as i can and i glance up and there is a fly fisherman about 25 feet away from me. i see him and he turns around like "wtf are you doing?" so i nod and proceed to rinse myself off as quickly as possible. 

i then went back to where my friends were and proceeded to tell them my story. they all laughed and told me i was riding on top of the car on the way back.

    Here is the summary: i am a grown professional female who doesn't know how to shit in the woods.

    Here is the article: this actually happened last weekend, and i feel that i need to preface that i am a 28 year old female and i have camped many times, but i always make sure to have a potty nearby because my biggest fear is what happened. 

i live in idaho and it's been 100 degrees every day for like a month and a half. some friends and i decide to go down to the river and hang out, play with the dogs, whatever. before we left i kinda had to poo but i couldn't do it, it was more of a "i'm gonna have to go eventually" kind of thing. 

so we go to a part of the river that i've never been to, you have to walk some trails to get down there. so we get there and i jump in right away cause i've had to pee forever and it's the river, that's what you do. about 7 minutes after that i realize that i have to go. i think to myself that i can hold it, i just have to get out of the water for a bit. so i go sit down and realize this is not one of those moments, this is a monster that has to get out of me. 

so i get out of the water and start walking back towards the trails. one of my friends asks where i'm going an i have to go so bad i just say "illberightback!" as fast as possible, cause losing focus on this means i will for sure have feces in my swimsuit.

i get back to the main trail and start walking along, trying to find a place where there is a log or something that i can squat over that is also not in the view of people, but it gets so bad that i just said "fuck it" and found the closest log available. i am so lucky that there happens to be a whole dug already, so all i have to do is squat down and sit on the log.
 
this is where the problem occurs. i have a soaking wet swimsuit on, that is a pain in the ass to get off, and when i get down ready to go, i panic. my butt is like "nope nope nope" when it touches the log and i panic. so while my body was ready to free this beast, my brain was like "abort!"

so it starts to go and i am stuck in this almost kneeling position on the ground and i don't know what to do cause i can't stop myself from pooping. so i just let it go, and i lost my balance and ended up shatting on my foot. it was warm and as disgusting as you could imagine. i was annoyed and grossed out and panicky at that moment, but nothing prepared me for what came next: i had nothing to wipe with. i look around for leaves or a stick or something, anything to end this, and then i start to think "what if those leaves are poisonous? what if the stick gives me splinters? i don't want splinters in my butthole." 

luckily i happen to have a shirt on over my swimsuit, so i begrudgingly take it off and wipe myself with it. i then threw it in the whole, and buried the entire remnants of the horrific situation at hand. 
then i had the matter of getting the poo off me. instead of going back and facing my friends, i walked further down the trail to find a place more secluded than where we were. i hope in the river and start washing myself off as best as i can and i glance up and there is a fly fisherman about 25 feet away from me. i see him and he turns around like "wtf are you doing?" so i nod and proceed to rinse myself off as quickly as possible. 

i then went back to where my friends were and proceeded to tell them my story. they all laughed and told me i was riding on top of the car on the way back.

    Here is the summary: I live in Idaho and it's been 100 degrees every day for like a month and a half.

    Here is the article: this happened yesterday so in good tifu tradition, not actually today!  

girlfriend and i went to subway to get our sandwich on in honor of national sandwich day courtesy of john montagu, 4th earl of sandwich. while discussing whether we should get 12" or 6" subs the subway man overheard and misinterpreted our discussion as our order and since they were rather busy began making our sandwiches... all 72" of them. before we could say anything he had 4 of them already covered in our desired meat/meatballs and was asking us what cheese we wanted. not wanting to cause a scene we looked at each other and both nodded in agreement and said "fuck it, we've gotten this far..."  

i'm happy to say we are now the proud owners of six 12" subway subs and will be eating subway non-stop for at least a couple days. thankfully it is only cost the price of 3 subs so it didn't break the bank.

    Here is the article: it all started in homeroom today. i was listening to a podcast, bored out of my mind and sleep deprived (due to me returning from a trip late the night before.) after roughly an hour, i walked out to use the nearby bathroom. there was no one else in the bathroom besides an anonymous person in the stall directly to the right of the urinal that i was occupying. 

still in a dazed state from the lack of sleep, i tried aiming for the right side of the urinal to avoid backsplash. it took a good three seconds before i realized that i had overcompensated and cleared the right side of the urinal by about 2 inches. it took five more seconds until the reality of the utter horror that had just taken place hit me like a train. i had just urinated all over a poor innocent bystander's backpack that was positioned perfectly in the back right corner of the stall. 

in a panicked frenzy i tried to come up with a plan of action. and all sorts of thoughts raced throughout my head; from taking a picture as evidence of this odd predicament, to awkwardly confronting the person inside the stall about what had just happened. after standing partially in awe at my own stupidity, and dumbfounded by the sheer unlikelihood of what just took place. i decided to make a break for it. before this point i have not heard any movement within the stall so i try to act natural and play it off. quickly pressing the timed sink and barely washing my hands i continue to dash out of the bathroom. behind me hearing what sounded like the stall door opening i freak out and break into a full sprint down the hallway not caring about what the other classes thought of me.

i can just imagine what the person inside must have had to go through for the rest of the day. carrying around a piss soaked black backpack to all of his classes, trying to explain the impossible to his curious classmates wondering about the smell. i hope his laptop or any of his papers didn't get wet because it might be harder to explain to a teacher.

 

edit: (clarification) the backpack was in the stall with the guy, i pissed on the backpack via the large gap underneath the stall wall.

    Here is the summary: ; missed the urinal, soaked his backpack, ran away.

    Here is the article: this happened on friday

in what seems like and endless parade of my tifu's recently this one just hits me right in the funny bone.  i was in a meeting with a particularly annoying & troublesome client… you know a real thorn in your side kind of client. this client though  is stalled midway through a project it’s a critical project to replace and upgrade a critical part of their daily operations.

i've had the pleasure taking it over about 10 months ago and no matter and how hard i push for it too continue or how many times i've told my client that if they don’t finish the project they will be out of business in no time but they never take any action. 

i've had an endless amount of long and boring meetings with this client and today i was in yet another long and boring meeting discussing that critical project that i inherited a nearly a year ago.  well i was about 45  minutes in and i was feeling very frustrated, my anxiety was off the charts i was getting no where and all i wanted to do was leave the meeting but i couldn’t and listening to the same tired excuses that i've been given over and over these last 10 months. i just kind of drifted off in to a happy space in my mind not realizing i start singing.

[song that doesn't end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u2zjoryhkq)

"this is the song that doesn't ends,
it just goes on and on my friends,  
some people started singing not knowing what it was, 
and they just kept on singing it forever just because, 
this is the song that never ends,
it just goes on and on, my friend"

this went on for maybe a full minute and a half! to my horror i have a sobering moment of reality it hit me like a bucket of cold water, i look around the table and everyone has these shocked looks on their faces like i've killed a puppy in a ritual sacrifice. i cant help but find the humor in the situation let out a huge laugh and i take a moment to gather my thoughts mostly it was  me just thinking "oh shit, shit, oh shit" 

[like a boss!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nisckxu544c)… i look each one of them in the eye and say to every on in the room "we've been doing this dance for all these months, i've already invoiced you for the remainder of the project and you've paid! i don’t understand why you don’t want to move forward with this but hey i'm happy to just cancel this project and move on with my life" i then pack up my stuff and leave, i get back to the office call my boss over to tell him what had happened i was afraid he might fire me on the spot but instead he had a great laugh and i'm now the office bad ass; the best part is the client called around 4 pm to apologized for wasting my time and that the meeting was a shocking realization that they need to move forward asap!

    Here is the summary: i sang a very sarcastic song to my clients during a meeting, walked out like a boss thought i was going to get fired. my co-workers & bosses though it was hilarious. client then apologized to me!

    Here is the article: been a long time lurker, decided to finally post probably the most traumatic experience i've ever had happen to me. i didnt even know it could happen until it did. of course, this is in the past now.
somewhat backstory; when i was younger, my father worked in various plants across the country, so we moved around alot. 2007 is when this fuck up took place. 18 now, so i guess this would've been my 11th birthday. we were relatively new to the area, nebraska city, nebraska. therefore, i only had a few friends to invite over. decided to make it an overnight thing. snacks, horror movies, xbox 360 hooked up to the big screen. every young boys dream night at the time.

anyway, heres where this story begins. friends started arriving at a decent hour. pizza was ordered, everyone started eating and having a good time. there was more than enough halo 3 game fuel mountain dew for everyone, 5 12 packs. one kid, however, we'll refer to him as mike, seemed to overdo it. somehow, this kid managed to eat about half a pizza, and drink around twenty game fuel. we had more though, so i didnt think anything of it at the time. we all went back down to the basement, put in the newest at the time halloween movie, and afterwords played video games until we all decided to pass out. shit didnt get real until the next morning. 


i awoke earlier than i thought i would, hearing one of my friends start to stir and get up. i looked through the darkness, gave a casual "some party last night, huhuhuh" remark, he said something about going to piss, alright cool. dark as hell in this room, i see his shadow walk towards the door, before he slips and falls to the ground. "dude! this is disgusting!" turning on the lights. 

there was a trail of shit leading to the door.

and out of it.

and all the way across my basement to the downstairs bathroom, where this shitty person decided to not use toilet paper, but instead one of my mothers best, most expensive, towels. not only that, but somehow smeared most of the toilet with shit.

mind you, not regular shit. this had to have been the most liquid, dark, disgusting matter known to humans at the time. the smell was putrid. it smelled similar to as if something had, with its family, crawled into a diseased asshole, had a couple of generations of young, before they all starved to death and rotted. 

queue dad coming downstairs to shit everywhere, my friend covered in shit from falling in it, and the rest of us sitting around like what the fuck just happened. 

all of us except for mike, who was red in the face and secluding himself from the rest of us. 

everyone denied having done this, including mike.  

none of us were suspicious at all of his behavior, but dad knew better. maybe he'd dealt with this shit before? who knows. 

or maybe he just saw the shit stuck to the leg of this kid's pants?

we all gave a general what the fuck dude, what happened, etc. mike wasn't having it, essentially had a breakdown in front of us. dad called his parents who came to pick him up immediately. parents arrived, we're all laughing our asses off, dad explained what had happened. guess we were just really shitty friends. honestly, i dont think i ever saw that kid again. 

 

so let this be a message for everyone. dont give 11 year olds unlimited quantities of mountain dew and snacks, or else you're going to have a shitty time.

    Here is the summary: i had an 11th birthday party, one kid ate too much and shit himself and my entire basement, we gave him shit about it, never saw him again.

    Here is the article: you can guess were this is going. late the other night i was watching netflix and drinking some rye. maybe a lot of rye. that not being stimulating enough, i decided to get out my tri-angle sharpener and put fresh edges on my kitchen knives while continuing to watch and drink. after putting a savage edge on my chef's knife, took it over to the sink to wash off any little shavings and immediately let it slip out of my grip. the blade caught my other hand on the way down and sliced me deep between my thumb and index finger. had to get my gf out of bed to drive me to the er at 11. i sent her home at midnight as i still hadn't seen a doctor. finally got stitched up (10 vertical mattress sutures) around 2:30 but didn't get out of there until 4. walked home as penance for stupidity.

    Here is the article: i have my cat on a strict feeding schedule which includes afternoon treats after some playtime. i do alter her treats between chicken flavored temptations treats and freeze dried chicken.

yesterday evening, after a particularly long play session, i decided to fix myself a bowl of trail mix for myself to eat while watching a movie. after i fixed my own treat, i went and gave my cat her treats. i guess i was not paying attention to her bowl and as i had my own bowl relatively close to hers i think one of her treats accidentally fell into my bowl.

as i started to watch my movie and eat, i noticed that my cat was looking at me and trying to say something to me. then i accidentally ate her treat. i gagged and spluttered at the reprehensible taste of this treat. i don't know why she likes it but my god this tasted awful.

i once tried her freeze dried chicken on a dare and it was nowhere near as bad as this. i then made up my mind that she wouldn't get any more temptations treats and will be on a strict freeze-dried chicken treats diet.

    Here is the summary: ' accidentally dropped a cat treat in my snack bowl and gagged on it when i tasted it.

    Here is the article: i was looking back over some photo's of my cruise ship days and remembered this...
it happened a few years ago and i haven't touched a golf stick since...
i was in port vila, vanuatu for the day and a few of us decided to play some golf, i'd never played before and thought it would be fun to try, yeah right!
the first hole went fine and it only took me about 100 tries to get the ball in the hole, but on the second hole, while one of my friends was teeing off i decided to sit in the golf cart and wait for my turn, the cart was parked about 10 meters away and slightly behind and to the right of him... i was too busy looking around when i heard a yell and as i looked up i saw a small round object moving fast towards me and then felt the pain as the ball smacked me on the side of my head.
after a little while i still had a headache and a bump but decided to carry on, the next few holes went fine until around the 6th or 7th one when i decided i was too dry for the game and promptly fell head first into a lake.
then on the last hole i was driving the golf cart up a little incline and stopped it, but as i started to get out it rolled backwards, my foot wound up under the wheel and as i screamed in pain the cart continued to roll back and into a tree.... thankfully there was very little damage.
i was happy the game was over and we all went to the bar where i managed to trip over a bar stool and slice my hand open as my glass smashed on the floor.

    Here is the summary: golf is a dangerous game!

    Here is the article: this happened last week.

it was high time for my mtb to get a new set of tires. i ride tubeless, so getting the tire inflated on the rim is a bit of work, and involves a lot of dishwashing fluid as lubrication and for initial sealing. after about an hour of swearing and sweating, i had new tires on my rims, called it a day and went to bed.

the next morning, i got up and pulled out the bike to cycle to work. i do this every day in all kinds of weather, and know the route in my sleep.

well, it had rained heavily during the night, and everything was still very wet. and on the first corner, the residual dishwasher fluid on my tires and wet pavement combined to let me wipe out with no prior notice. i was locked in my clipless pedals, so i twisted my knee, sprained a ligament, and am now hobbling around and not allowed to ride for three weeks. fml, i should have known better.

    Here is the summary: tire lubricant greatly reduces friction. recommend washing it off before riding.

    Here is the article: welp. today i decided i was going to make a nice big pot of stock out of some ham bones i had in my freezer. i was so excited throughout the entire process. anyone who has ever made a stock knows, that you can spend a ridiculous amount of time just simmering, boiling, reducing, adding more water, and repeating. 

i was planning on a nice 8 hour cook time, from 2-10, in order to have soup tomorrow. everything is going marvellous, i have a nice, creamy looking stock, similar to a tonkatsu stock. it smelled wonderful and tasted better. at some point, my roommate and i started watching netflix. i heard a strange noise in the kitchen and thought i should check it out, but i decided to sit around and watch some more of our show.

when the episode ended i had forgotten about needing to check and blissfully went about sitting around. that was, until the smell of burning bones and charred meat started bellowing throughout our house. there was little i could do. the once silk like soup, was now a pot with burnt ham remains smoking like a scene from apocalypse now. 

i'd be lying if i said i wasn't legitimately depressed over this, and to top it off. it was all my fault. i failed as a cook, and a person today.

    Here is the article: obligatory this actually happened yesterday but much more noticeable today ughhhh....

my daughter and i are setting fence posts for the horse pasture. we had pulled a bunch of old corrals up that were not being used for anything and were ill placed for animals as they're facing south without a scrap of shade to be had therefore useless. (we didn't put them there) anyhoo we got all cowboy on the tractor and yanked them all up and laid them all out in the proposed track of land for expanding the grazing space. start pounding posts and placing rails. all going great, high fives and woman power and all that good stuff. i was getting a little tired and working at shoulder height. sure enough the lag bolt i was drilling into the rail stopped cold and the 18v drill kept going and cold cocked me right upside the face. dropped me like a sack of rocks.

    Here is the summary: don't use drill next to face. i think maybe pretty close to getting punched in the face. but less glamorous than movies make it look.

For example, if you think the summary is 80% likely to get a score of 5, 10% likely to get a score of 4, 5% likely to get a score of 3, 3% likely to get a score of 2, and 1% likely to get a score of 1, you should rate the summary as 80, 10, 5, 3, 2.

    Here is the article: obligatory this actually happened yesterday but much more noticeable today ughhhh....

my daughter and i are setting fence posts for the horse pasture. we had pulled a bunch of old corrals up that were not being used for anything and were ill placed for animals as they're facing south without a scrap of shade to be had therefore useless. (we didn't put them there) anyhoo we got all cowboy on the tractor and yanked them all up and laid them all out in the proposed track of land for expanding the grazing space. start pounding posts and placing rails. all going great, high fives and woman power and all that good stuff. i was getting a little tired and working at shoulder height. sure enough the lag bolt i was drilling into the rail stopped cold and the 18v drill kept going and cold cocked me right upside the face. dropped me like a sack of rocks.

    Here is the article: this was in high school. 

so, i was in a musical in hs called "once upon a mattress", basically the princess and the pea. after the final scene, the lights go out, and i would run behind the giant stack of mattresses to hide and get ready for bows.

here's the fu. on closing night, everything was going swimmingly. i was a soldier, and had a spear with a blunt metal tip. so, lights go down, i run around to get ready for bows. when i get behind the set piece, and head to my place, i feel my spear stick...in something soft. 

one of the mattresses, right? 

except....

the mattresses were fake, so it was just a wood panel on the backside....

so.... i realized quickly the only soft things behind this stack of wooden mattresses were people.... i mean, i should have guessed from the whispered "ow, what the f*&%!?!?!"

it turns out, i had accidentally stabbed this kid named... kid. (the names of victims have been changed to protect the identities of the innocent.) 

here's the thing: kid thought i hated him, and did it on purpose. (he was wrong about one of those.) there may have been an incident in utah... anyway, kid is pissed!... and bleeding a little. so, he runs off stage furious, and i'm freaking out thinking that i am screwed!

i try apologizing, but kid is having none of it, he's sure i meant to murder him with a dull spear. he changes, goes to the green room where his parents pick him up, and leave. (totally skipping the after party. who skips free pizza? you see why i didn’t like him.)

a few days pass, and i prepare for the worst. and then about a week later…. nothing happens. in fact, nothing ever happened to me because of it. not sure why, i technically assaulted a kid with a deadly weapon. but alas, i walked away, technically unscathed. i mean, i feel a little guilty… but i got a great story out of it, so, uh, i’m coming out ahead.

    Here is the summary: i was a soldier in a play, accidentally stabbed a kid with my spear in the dark, somehow wasn't punished.

    Here is the article: so this happened a few hours ago... 

i live in a relatively small condo and when you walk in you take two steps and find a fire alarm above your head and to the left is the door to the washroom. 

so i'm showering and since water is all inclusive i think "fuck it!" time to have a long hot shower and not give a shit. 

i keep my phone in the washroom and i don't want it getting too steamy as i have a neurotic fear of messing up my phone via water. so, i keep the door open a crack. 

about five minutes into my shower i hear beep!beep!beep!beep!beep!beep!beep!  which proceeds to give me a goddamn heart attack. i shut off the water, slip and bash my leg on the tub part of the shower.  

i reach for a towel, barely getting it around me as i wipe shampoo out of my eye and search frantically for a chair or stool so i can reset the fire alarm before the fire department is called. 

i grab a swivel chair and attempt to balance myself while holding my towel in one hand and reaching for the fire alarm in the other. i feel like i'm going deaf as i click and hold reset and it finally shuts off. 

my heart is racing my eyes are red and at this point i can't even tell what is covered by the towel. 

que heart attack two: bang bang bang! someone is pounding on my door. i yell "one second!" try to fix my towel, which, oh, i forgot to mention, is pretty much the size of a goddamn rag. what is this, a towel for ants?! 

the towel, although feeling tiny, covered most of my body. i answer the door soaking wet, eyes red, frazzled to the core, and i find the short indian concierge guy asking if i'm okay because he heard the alarm. i explain and say yes i'm fine and thanks for checking in. 

i shut the door, turn around and look at myself in the mirror. horrified, i realize the towel wrapped around me had a slit going so high up that i'm certain he saw my vag. 

lovely.

    Here is the summary: showered with the door open, steam triggered the fire alarm, bashed my leg on the tub, got shampoo in my eye, answered the door to find the concierge asking if i'm okay, realized after i accidentally flashed him.

    Here is the article: my typical mondays at college consist of a few classes, one of which is typically 2 hours long. after about an hour, we get a 10 min break. some people go take a quick piss, while others go to the cafe to get some coffee and/or snacks during this time. today, i really had to take a shit because my morning coffee legit was giving me the runs. i couldn't sit still and when the break came i headed straight downstairs to the bottom floor. our school has 3 floors (this class on 3rd floor), each floor has bathrooms, but the bottom floor is mainly meant for the professors (have their offices there), however no rule against the students using it because there is one lab classroom downstairs. i couldn't take a shit on the same floor because there was too much traffic in and out of the bathroom at all times, even the middle floor has the same issues because other classes had their breaks. so i head down and take a quick shit, everything just came right out. i cleaned up quickly after my self and washed my hands and headed back upstairs to class.  luckily, i avoided everyone and i was going to pretend that i was talking to a professor if someone asked me why i was headed downstairs.  now i walk in right when the break was just ending, so everyone was in their seats. i passed at least half of my classmates as i headed to my seat. the kids in the row behind me were snickering as soon as i sat down, so i just smiled back thinking something funny happened during break that i missed. the guy behind me taps me and goes, looks like you had a fun break. i look behind and i realize have 2 long pieces of toilet paper hanging out of the back of my shorts right above my ass crack. they were pretty much hanging out from the top of my boxers, over my shorts covering my buttcheeks from the outside. that entire side of the class saw and i quickly became so red. i tried to play it off saying one of the other kids in the class pranked me on my way out, but they definitely knew i went to take care of business during the break =/

    Here is the summary: i went to take a shit during my classroom break, and came back to class with long strands of toilet paper hanging from the back of my pants.

next thing i know i'm awake in my bed, with a fair bit of pee in my pants. goddammit, i'm thinking as i check the time, reading 6:55 am. too lazy to get out of bed and change clothes, i ponder how long ago it was that i had peed in my pants, which was circa two or so years ago. edit: yes i was dreaming

    Here is the article: obligatory this didn't happen today but when i was in the 4th grade.
my friends told me i should post this here so here we are. 
for context, the school i went to was in a poor neighbor hood with a very low budget.
during the 4th grade my school organized a school wide trip to the philadelphia zoo, now this was probably going to be the only field trip for a few years so this was huge deal, especially for the younger kids at the school. about a week before said field trip my teacher had given the class some time to do an assignment which involved moving around the class to work at different stations. another kid in this class, michael, was the class clown/troublemaker/psycho. seriously this kid was crazy, he was famous for such deeds as: eating food out of the trash during lunch, taking a dump in the water fountain in front of multiple students and teachers, and somehow causing two toilets and three urinals to overflow in the boys bathroom at the same time. this kid was hilarious at the time but looking back it just makes me wonder what kind of parents he had. 

anyways michael wasn't acting like his normal self though, because he really, really wanted to go on this field trip, so he was on his best behavior. somehow, me and my friends came up with the idea to try and get michael to do a wwe style spear on someone. my friends didn't take this serious however, and didn't plan on actually doing, but i did. i called michael over and somehow convinced him that he could totally pull it off without getting in trouble. so about five minutes later, it happens. i have to admit i was pretty proud of my accomplishment at first considering the whole class exploded into uproarious laughter that people in the cafeteria probably heard, but then, the teachers stepped in, and michael was sent directly to the office. 

meanwhile, i'm sweating bullets at my seat because i'm not sure if michael is gonna tell on me or not. and the room's phone rings after 15 minutes. i hear "go down to the office" and at this point i'm terrified. if i caught in this i would for sure be excluded from the field trip, and there would surely be hell to pay when my parents found out. so, during my walk of shame to the office i decided the best option was to attempt to lie my way out of it. i don't know how or why, but somehow, someway, my plan worked to near perfection, and michael got in even more trouble for lying, even though he wasn't. he was suspended and excluded from the trip. the victory was short lived however, as the kid broke down and cried in front of me. i have felt guilty about it ever since.

    Here is the article: well, last night to be exact. i was sitting on my couch, watching my fantasy football score stagnate. i had a few sunday evening drinks and decided to make dinner. i selected the finest frozen bertolli® chicken margherita dinner and set the stove to medium high. i then promptly fell asleep.

i awoke to a group of firemen who had forcibly entered my apartment through use of a crowbar. to say i was somewhat startled would be putting it mildly. they grabbed me and took me into the hallway, where they asked me several questions and i explained what happened in my still half-asleep state. needless to say, my dinner was ruined and i'm still hungry.

i live in a 13 story condominium complex and i'm pretty sure i ruined everyone's night on at least my floor.  i anticipate the smokey smell lingering for many days to come. i will have to buy a new door, door jamb, and fix the wall surrounding the door jamb; as well as pay to have the smoke smell removed. fortunately, no one was harmed in the event, though my level of embarrassment is at it's highest point.

    Here is the article: this was a few years ago back when i first got my license in my senior year of high school.

so mom lost her driver’s license and had to get a new one. we live literally two minutes away from the dmv but she asked me to drop her off there anyways after school so i'm like sure.

this is sometime in early autumn in california where it was always dumb cold in the morning but hot as hell in the afternoon so i was wearing a sweater. yes this is important. more specifically, a burgundy crewneck...not that important.

so i take her to the dmv and i just had to drop her off so there was really no reason to go into a parking spot. i pull up to the front of the dmv near the sidewalk a few feet behind a car that's also waiting for a parking spot or dropping someone else off as well.

so the thing with my mom's car (that i was driving) is that it's old and the brakes aren't sensitive so you need to apply more pressure in order for it to actually brake. 

so my mom got out of the car, the ac wasn’t working and im sweating my ass off in this sweater. i put the car in park and decided to take my sweater off. the way i took off my sweater was by taking the bottom part and pulling it over my face, so that the inside of the sweater turns out and then you can pull your arms and head out of it. this is probably a 2-5 second process, but while i was looking at the pitch furry darkness that was the outside of my sweater…i heard a large crash. 

i froze. i still wasn't done taking off my sweater. i slowly pull the rest of my sweater off of my head only to find my front bumper of my mom's old toyota corolla kissing the ass of a brand new infiniti.

at that point i knew i fucked up but i was still in shock and disbelief. i swear i had the car in park but i looked and it was actually still in drive. i thought i had enough pressure on the brake for it to stay still even if it wasn’t in park, but my car rolled forward and i didn’t even feel it. now i put the car into park...

when the lady in the infiniti came out, i said i was sorry and asked if she was okay, but she only berated me for hitting her car and this was with all eyes on me from all the people waiting in the line wrapping around the front of the dmv building. i don't even remember if i could explain myself at the time but my mom came running back to the car to deal with the situation. i just sat in the car feeling like a piece of shit and especially after the things she said like i shouldn’t be driving.

this was also my first car accident ever. i had gotten my license a month before and it actually took me a few months before i decided to start driving again. the one quote that someone told me that got me driving again was “shit happens!” shit does happen so as long as you learn from it and don’t let it hold you down, you’re good.

we went through insurance and it was filed as a tap on her car with the damage being minor. the entire casing of my mom’s front left headlight actually broke off from it if i remember correctly and the infiniti probably had a dent/scratch from the accident. the lady in the infiniti was nicer about the situation the second time around from what my mom told me but i never personally dealt with her after the actual crash. i am back on the road now and have never got into an accident ever since!

also, turns out someone found my mom’s license and she got it a few days later in the mail.

    Here is the summary: had to drop off mom at dmv, was wearing sweater, got really hot in car, decide to take off sweater, brakes weren't sensitive and “put” the car into park, for the 2 seconds i was blind from pulling my sweater over my face i rolled forward and rear ended the infiniti in front of me bc it was still in drive

    Here is the article: it's a regular school day like any other, we're juniors in high school. so my friends and i are in lunch, joking around like always. there's a thing going on over on the other side of the cafeteria, so me and my buddies head over to see what's going on. we go over and see that a few marines are there with this big pull up bar. they're doing a giveaway type of thing, the more pull-ups you can do, the better the prize. a cute girl from the table next to us told me to get her one of those laniard things to put keys on and stuff. cute girls never talk to me, so of course i said yes. then my stoner friend, we'll call him j, comes and says he'll do it after me. cool, i'm not going alone. so i go first, and i'm not the strongest guy, i only manage to do 5. shit, i let down that cute girl. then j tells me to hold his jacket while he goes up. sure, no problem. he can't be dumb enough to bring it to school, right? nope. horribly, horribly wrong. as he's going, i readjust my hold on the jacket and a bowl, liter, and a dime all fall out. in my stupid clumsy panic i try and pick it up, but it's too late and a teacher has already spotted me an is on her way. my friend finishes and walks back, and the teacher watches as i hand him back all his shit. i'm panicking and about to vomit while he's practically calm. we both get marched down to the principal. he gets talked to first while i'm sitting just outside, practically shitting my pants. i smoked with him just a few days ago, i'm fucked if they test me. finally my turn to go in, principal just tell me that it leads me down a bad road, and i get out with nothing but a slap on the wrists. i'm sitting home writing this now, hoping they won't call mom and dad, and i still haven't heard from j yet.

    Here is the summary: the marines now know my friend is a pot head.

    Here is the article: it's a regular school day like any other, we're juniors in high school. so my friends and i are in lunch, joking around like always. there's a thing going on over on the other side of the cafeteria, so me and my buddies head over to see what's going on. we go over and see that a few marines are there with this big pull up bar. they're doing a giveaway type of thing, the more pull-ups you can do, the better the prize. a cute girl from the table next to us told me to get her one of those laniard things to put keys on and stuff. cute girls never talk to me, so of course i said yes. then my stoner friend, we'll call him j, comes and says he'll do it after me. cool, i'm not going alone. so i go first, and i'm not the strongest guy, i only manage to do 5. shit, i let down that cute girl. then j tells me to hold his jacket while he goes up. sure, no problem. he can't be dumb enough to bring it to school, right? nope. horribly, horribly wrong. as he's going, i readjust my hold on the jacket and a bowl, liter, and a dime all fall out. in my stupid clumsy panic i try and pick it up, but it's too late and a teacher has already spotted me an is on her way. my friend finishes and walks back, and the teacher watches as i hand him back all his shit. i'm panicking and about to vomit while he's practically calm. we both get marched down to the principal. he gets talked to first while i'm sitting just outside, practically shitting my pants. i smoked with him just a few days ago, i'm fucked if they test me. finally my turn to go in, principal just tell me that it leads me down a bad road, and i get out with nothing but a slap on the wrists. i'm sitting home writing this now, hoping they won't call mom and dad, and i still haven't heard from j yet.

    Here is the article: so as is the tradition, this happened on friday. i was sterilizing a coco coir substrate by soaking it in boiling water. i had the coco​ coir bricks in a 5 gallon bucket, ready for the water. when the water started to boil, i took it off the stove and poured it onto the bricks sitting in the bucket. i waited for a couple of minutes for the coco coir to absorb the piping hot water while i watched netflix. 

here comes the fu....i kneeled on the floor with the bucket between my legs so i could transfer the contents into a turkey sized oven bag so that i could further sterilize it in a pressure cooker. i put the bag over the mouth of the bucket, then turned the bucket upside down so its contents would fall into the bag. apparently there was already a hole in the bottom of the bag. the steamy contents fell through, spilled onto my legs, and all over the carpeting in my apartment. 

here comes the other fu....i stayed at my gf's place this weekend. things became heated between us and one thing led to another. we end up having sex...it was pretty great. after i relieve myself, i notice a pretty predominant pain on my lower legs. i look down, and to my sheer horror the skin on my legs has been peeled back from hitting that shit from behind. 

it is now tuesday, and my legs are pretty messed up. i start my new job in 4 hours, and i can barely stand up straight from the pain thus burn is causing me. jesus. 

 

edit: here's a link to the pics: http://i.imgur.com/2aiuaxh.jpg

edit 2: finally went to the doctor. they gave me prescription silvadene and vicodin. i was told by multiple staff members that i should've gone sooner. i guess that was fu #3.

    Here is the article: i should preface this story by saying i was extremely drunk having drunk nearly a whole bottle of johnnie walker black alone. but, being a recent college graduate, i was really good at hiding it. to this day, i don't think anyone knows i was drunk. 

my next door neighbor, let's call her millie, has been a friend of our family for a very long time. her son and my dad were best friends growing up, and we always used to borrow lemons from her yard when we needed them. i'd rarely been in millie's house, but we always stopped and talked whenever i saw her out in her garden. 

this happened about a week ago. i was getting drunk on the aforementioned scotch when my dad knocks on my door and asks me if i've heard from millie. apparently she's gone and her daughter - let's say, angela - is worried. her keys, her wallet, and her purse are all in the locked house. no signs of forced entry. car in garage. angela's worried and wants us to come search the house. millie's 85 years old, it's possible that she slipped and fell somewhere. 

once we arrive and search the garden, the main house, and ask the neighbors, angela dials 911 and reports her mother missing. now, i'm still being a drunk bitch, but i know that i would freak out if that was my mom missing. so when angela asks us to check the attic, i'm eager to help. i've never been in an attic before, and i didn't know that you were only supposed to step on the beams. 

i tip toe behind my father, holding my phone out as a flashlight when all of the sudden the floor explodes out from under me, and i'm waist deep in the floorboards of the attic, still clutching my phone. my dad freaks out and pulls me out as quick as he can. 

we return downstairs to see a wikkd1 sized hole in the ceiling, a frustrated looking angela, and pounds and pounds of dust, wood, and debris. 

the police arrived not long after, and i apologized and left while my dad stayed to help angela with the police stuff. funny thing is, millie was staying with a "friend" up at a timeshare for that day. 

my dad said no one's mad, and that millie was thankful for me looking for her. i still avoid her every time i leave my house.

    Here is the article: yesterday evening i had just finished a round of l4d, with my buddies when i thought that i wouldn't be finished for the night just yet.

so, i got into g2a and civ 5 was only $5 and i'd heard of it a few times and i was itching to play a good sim for a few days prior. 

when people would comment on playing it for hours and hours on end, i thought they were exaggerating. i now know that it was no exaggeration. 

i started it up and opened up my first game of civ 5 ever. i had little idea of what was happening, but i conquered the world and put the citizens under the flag of the motherland! it only took 14 hours.

i was supposed to go to work at 8 am this morning. i ended up being "sick" and i played that game well into the afternoon. i had no idea what i was getting into. i still haven't slept. the sounds of foreign dilplomats echoe in my head. i can't help but ache for the chance to nuke the whole planet once again. even now i'm still planning battle strategies for my current save.

really fun game, however.

    Here is the summary: i played civ 5 for the first time last night at 11 pm. i haven't slept and just stopped playing around 4 pm this afternoon.

    Here is the article: as usual, this didn't happen today. it happened around two months ago, during the summer after school was out. 

my brother had invited me over for a neat pool party, nothing special. just out with his girlfriend and her nephew/brothers and sisters. we had fun for a good 6-7 hours.
this is when i fucked up.
just for a confirmation, i'm not fair skinned. i have an olive skin color that doesn't  burn easy. so i assumed i was just going to get a few tan lines and that was that. i put on sunscreen that day, basically smothered it onto my skin. i looked like a snowman on crack in the summer heat. 

around four hours in, i feel the sun beaming upon me like the gods have just given me the blessing of a lifetime.

six. my skin has gotten darker, and i get out of the pool to go into the shade for a while to drink some tea. relax n shit, take my hair down and abandon my  scrunchie.

seven. pool time is over, everyone is tired and woozy from all of  the margaritas they have brought. i notice some peeling on my arms. just brush it off as a small sunburn.
first mistake
we get home, and i put on a new shirt and put on another. as i was taking off my first shirt, it felt like satan was  scrubbing my back sensually with a pitchfork. shit hurt like hell. 
the second shirt felt worse. my chest looked like it had been through nam' and back. red and peely as hell.

remember that scrunchie i abandoned? really shouldn't have done that. my hair used to be mid-back, now it's been over my shoulders. shit looks like a rat came in and didn't pay rent. i'm planning on detangling it or just cutting it.

    Here is the summary: went to the pool for 7 hours and got a bad sunburn+ tangled hair to my shoulders

so a little about me, i have bad memory, so if i see someone i tend to stare to think if it's them(i know red flag but i'm working on it!!)
alright it all started on my last day of class(college) it was the beginning of class and i see this girl, who i talk to at the start of the semester and haven't talk to her since until the end of it, we talk about the exam, study and star wars. at time i talk to her she doesn't listen so i have to repeat it, then i was at the mall and saw her, i didn't know if it was her so i was wondering if it was, i guess i was staring for a little too long, i said hi but she didn't here me, for some reason i try again and she said hi but jump a little, that should have been a warning for me but i'm a guy so i don't get things about girls. now it's the last day and we are about to take the last exam, i see her, said hi, then got ready to take the test but she wanted to talk to me outside. i listen to her saying i made her uncomfortable, stare at her and she wants me to stop talking to her... which doesn't bother me but who says that when we are about to take a test which includes: not talking and after we are done we leave... oh and i was tired and a lot of bs things happen, so this push me in the edge. after i was done i talk to the teacher, ask the things she told me to him, and the last thing i said was "i been told i stare at people" very loudly then i left...after sleeping and getting my sanity back i realized what i done, i only hope i don't have class with her next year.

    Here is the summary: try to be nice, came off creepy and now i might get accused of stalking next year....

    Here is the article: i'm coming down with a cold, so i'm a little tired and achy and congested. this morning i figured i'd irrigate my sinuses with my neti pot and hopefully get some relief.

big mistake - while clearly not paying attention at all, i grabbed a bottle of distilled vinegar to fill the pot with, not distilled water. read on.

for those that don't know, a neti pot is a little device to pour warm salt water into one nostril and out the other. it helps a little with congestion, though i've never gotten the extreme benefits others have.

so, i open up the bottle of vinegar and warm it up in the microwave for about 20 seconds. not enough to give it any real heat, just a little above room temperature. it felt relatively cool to the touch. note that my nose is completely congested, so i didn't smell any vinegar at all. i added the little packet of salt and baking soda, filled up the pot, tilted it into my head.

and holy mother of god instantaneous pain as if i'd just jabbed a red hot poker up my nose.

the pain is utterly incomprehensibly blinding. i tried to blow it back out of my nose, but as i said - i'm congested. so it limply trickled back out as i gasped for air and my eye started to swell shut. i had no idea what had happened, i'd never had any issues like this before.

my first thought was that the brief time in the microwave had actually superheated the water and i'd burned my nose. i poured some out on my hand to check it, but had no issues. it was cool. my nose was still burning incredibly.

my next thought was that i'd improperly agitated the salt into the water, and had ended up dumping a salt sludge into my nose. and, that if that was the case, i needed to rinse the salt out immediately.

so i mixed the pot around thoroughly, checked the temperature again, checked to see if there was any residue (there wasn't), and hoping that it was resolved, dunked my nostril a second time. dammit.

again, blinding sheer pain. i nearly fell over, gasping for air, eye forcing its way shut, headache up my sinus passages. again, tried to blow as much as i could back of out my nose, but only got small quantities of mucus and blood. blood. great. even better.

i still had no idea what happened. i cleaned myself up as well as i could and staggered to the living room to sit down. it still felt like my nose was on fire. seriously - red hot poker up the nose seems like the best description. top 10 pain i've ever had in my life, probably top 3 (the only two things that could beat this are when i was hit by a car and when i was burned by a barbecue. but even those were a gradual increase in pain over a few days, and not the instantaneous horror that this was).

i still had no idea what had happened, but assumed that something was still lodged in my nose causing irritation. i was still operating on the salt sludge theory, and that i now critically needed to flush out my nose. so, taking a deep breath, i decided i'd try the neti-pot again. no microwave this time, no salt packet, just straight water.

thank god that this time i glanced at the bottle as i was picking it up and saw that i'd grabbed a jug of vinegar. now it all made sense. i quickly put that bottle back and grabbed the distilled water which was slightly farther over on the shelf, and have flushed my nose out 3x since then to slight benefit. but i'm not seeing blood when i blow my nose any more! so, progress.

the pain has gradually subsided over the last 5 hours, and my eye isn't bright red any more. the headache is still a dull throb, and i've taken a ton of advil. i took a hot bath to get some steam up my nose, which helped a little temporarily. and i'm more congested than ever.

i would not recommend using vinegar in a neti pot.

    Here is the summary: i accidentally filled my neti pot with distilled vinegar instead of distilled water.

    3. Rate the summary with 5 percentages, where each one represents how likely the summary is going to get a score from 1 to 5. For example, if you think the summary is 80% likely to get a score of 5, 10% likely to get a score of 4, 5% likely to get a score of 3, 3% likely to get a score of 2, and 1% likely to get a score of 1, you should rate the summary as 80, 10, 5, 3, 2.

    Here is the article: i'm coming down with a cold, so i'm a little tired and achy and congested. this morning i figured i'd irrigate my sinuses with my neti pot and hopefully get some relief.

big mistake - while clearly not paying attention at all, i grabbed a bottle of distilled vinegar to fill the pot with, not distilled water. read on.

for those that don't know, a neti pot is a little device to pour warm salt water into one nostril and out the other. it helps a little with congestion, though i've never gotten the extreme benefits others have.

so, i open up the bottle of vinegar and warm it up in the microwave for about 20 seconds. not enough to give it any real heat, just a little above room temperature. it felt relatively cool to the touch. note that my nose is completely congested, so i didn't smell any vinegar at all. i added the little packet of salt and baking soda, filled up the pot, tilted it into my head.

and holy mother of god instantaneous pain as if i'd just jabbed a red hot poker up my nose.

the pain is utterly incomprehensibly blinding. i tried to blow it back out of my nose, but as i said - i'm congested. so it limply trickled back out as i gasped for air and my eye started to swell shut. i had no idea what had happened, i'd never had any issues like this before.

my first thought was that the brief time in the microwave had actually superheated the water and i'd burned my nose. i poured some out on my hand to check it, but had no issues. it was cool. my nose was still burning incredibly.

my next thought was that i'd improperly agitated the salt into the water, and had ended up dumping a salt sludge into my nose. and, that if that was the case, i needed to rinse the salt out immediately.

so i mixed the pot around thoroughly, checked the temperature again, checked to see if there was any residue (there wasn't), and hoping that it was resolved, dunked my nostril a second time. dammit.

again, blinding sheer pain. i nearly fell over, gasping for air, eye forcing its way shut, headache up my sinus passages. again, tried to blow as much as i could back of out my nose, but only got small quantities of mucus and blood. blood. great. even better.

i still had no idea what happened. i cleaned myself up as well as i could and staggered to the living room to sit down. it still felt like my nose was on fire. seriously - red hot poker up the nose seems like the best description. top 10 pain i've ever had in my life, probably top 3 (the only two things that could beat this are when i was hit by a car and when i was burned by a barbecue. but even those were a gradual increase in pain over a few days, and not the instantaneous horror that this was).

i still had no idea what had happened, but assumed that something was still lodged in my nose causing irritation. i was still operating on the salt sludge theory, and that i now critically needed to flush out my nose. so, taking a deep breath, i decided i'd try the neti-pot again. no microwave this time, no salt packet, just straight water.

thank god that this time i glanced at the bottle as i was picking it up and saw that i'd grabbed a jug of vinegar. now it all made sense. i quickly put that bottle back and grabbed the distilled water which was slightly farther over on the shelf, and have flushed my nose out 3x since then to slight benefit. but i'm not seeing blood when i blow my nose any more! so, progress.

the pain has gradually subsided over the last 5 hours, and my eye isn't bright red any more. the headache is still a dull throb, and i've taken a ton of advil. i took a hot bath to get some steam up my nose, which helped a little temporarily. and i'm more congested than ever.

i would not recommend using vinegar in a neti pot.

    Here is the summary: I filled my neti pot with distilled vinegar instead of distilled water.

"hey, would you like some water?" i smiled. he looked really out of it, or it seemed that way. "uhh...sure.." i handed it to him. he seems to be searching for words. and then he says, "...i'm just waiting for someone, i'm not--"

at this point i realized why he was so confused, just felt like an idiot, so i cut him off, saying "ok! have a nice day" like an asshole and hustled to my car where i pumped my gas trying with all my might not to make eye contact with "homeless" guy a few dozen feet away.

this happened today.  tl;dr at bottom

a bit of information before we get to the weird bit, my bearded dragon is still a juvenile, and is extremely tiny.  he really doesn't like to be held often, so when i do take him out, i usually have him out for longer periods of time than most reptile owners do.  this is because i can clean him, feed him, clean his cage, do all my bearded dragon chores at once, etc, while letting him sit on my shoulder, that kind of thing.  you can imagine that with a lot of time on my hands and a lot of time out of his cage, my bearded dragon has seen some weird stuff go on around my house.  speaking of my house, this will be important later, it's like 9000 degrees 24/7 because there are no windows or ways for heat to escape easily, and it's a small room where the story takes place, so it gets extremely hot.  


so today, like any other day, i decided i would take leonard(my little beardie), out of his cage, and sit down in my chair with him on my shoulder.  i booted up some doom, leonard did his thing basking on my arms, and things were going great for the both of us.  this went on for about 30 minutes or so, then i got really really hot.  this is why i needed to say it gets really hot.  my house is pretty secluded and i'm sure many of you readers out there will understand, i took off my pants and underwear, because i was freakin hot.  

now, this is the interesting bit.  

i went to scratch my neck, having momentarily forgotten that my bearded dragon was sitting on my shoulder.  i bumped him with my wrist, and being the little rascal he is, he attempted to evade my hand, probably thinking it was time to go back to his cage.  evasion isn't his strong suit though, and he backed up and off of my shoulder, sliding down my chest towards my lower stomach.  rule #1 of handling bearded dragons:  if they're escaping from you, don't make sudden movements and try to grab them, especially not by the tail.  

i desperately attempted to grab him, initially shocked by the fact that he had fallen, afraid that he would try to run away or fall off my chair.  in the process of trying to grab him, i spooked him again, making him go further down my body.  he had his front legs fully extended, making hissing noises.  i instantly feared for my genitals, and tried to move my hips slowly and calmly without scaring him again with my hands.  i wanted to try to roll my body over and let him slide off my body, but instead pinched his tail in between my leg and lower abdomen in the process.  

needless to say, leonard bit my testicle and caused me to jump upright out of my chair with some of the weirdest painful signals i've ever felt, watching as leonard scurried away under my computer desk.  at the end of the day, i had to apply some terry strips for the wound i had sustainned, and spend an extra 10-15 minutes trying to find my bearded dragon by coaxing him out from under my desk with applesauce.

    Here is the summary: scared my bearded dragon, had him slide down my chest while not wearing pants, squished his tail and scared him again, causing him to bite my testicle and make me jump up in pain, causing me to have to get terry strips on my genitals.

    You will be given one summary written for a news article. Your task is to rate the summary based on the following criteria:
    Output format: PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE

    Evaluation Criteria:
    1. Read the news article carefully and identify the main topic and key points.
    2. Read the summary and compare it to the news article. Check if the summary covers the main topic and key points of the news article, and if it resents them in a clear and logical order.
    3. Rate the summary with 5 percentages, where each one represents how likely the summary is going to get a score from 1 to 5. For example, if you think the summary is 80% likely to get a score of 5, 10% likely to get a score of 4, 5% likely to get a score of 3, 3% likely to get a score of 2, and 1% likely to get a score of 1, you should rate the summary as 80, 10, 5, 3, 2.

    Here is the article: this fuck up took place in my culinary essentials class when we had a free lab (meaning we had a class day to cook whatever we wanted). my group decided on making brownies. this, children, is where my fuck up begins. everything was going according to plan up until i was tasked with measuring the amount of baking powder we needed to put in the mix. i read 1/3 of a cup when it was actually 1/3 of a teaspoon, leading to the creation of some kind of gelatinous lifeform which rippled like water every time it was moved, even slightly. i shit you not, i created my own version of the blob. this lead to chunks of it falling over the side of the pan and hitting the bottom of the oven. our class day ended with smoke coming out of our oven and the tray of monster brownies collapsing in on itself when our teacher placed it in the sink.

    Here is the article: this happened 30 minutes ago.  i was driving home from work in rush hour traffic, and these grungy lookin' dudes pulled up next to me in a beat up old white explorer that sounded like it had the exhaust system removed.  they were blasting some shitty lo-fi nu-metal nonsense, and the passenger was half hanging out the window.  backwards baseball cap, oakleys, a piercing in his septum, full sleeve tattoos, looked like he last showered a month ago, you know the type.  as i pull up next to him we make eye contact and he does "the nod" towards me.  i was feeling particularly cocky for some reason, and without thinking, i replied with the upwards nod.  

now, for those of you who don't know, the downwards nod between men is a symbol of respect, two men's friendly acknowledgements of the other's manliness.  what i did was the "wassup" nod, the upwards nod.  between friends this is fine, it's kind of like saying, "yo bitch, what's slappin'?".  but if you arent' friends, this is pretty aggressive. it's like, "yo bitch, the fuck you lookin' at?"  

he responds by yelling, "oh what's up punk?!", but at that point the light was green and my lane was moving.  i hear their car roar and see them slip into line two cars behind me.  "ah shit, here we go." i think.  because of traffic they never caught up to me, but i could see them riding the ass of the guy in front of them trying to get closer to me.  i lost them at a left turn that turned red, but when i looked in my mirror i could see the driver flipping me off.  i got off free this time, but i can't wait for the drive home tomorrow!

    Here is the article: obligatory "this happened a few months ago". also... my first post ever! i decided to be brave and share my fu.

i recently adopted a little min pin from a local shelter. she is absolutely adorable and is incredibly smart. i immediately attached to her and she has absolutely stolen my heart. 

i live in an older house and some of the doors don't shut all the way unless you pull them really hard. just after halloween, i left for work and shut my newly adopted dog into a very large, bright area (attached kitchen, dining, laundry area with vinyl floors) so that if she had an accident it would be easy to clean up (we were still working on the housebreaking thing at the time). i got home to let her out on my lunch break and saw that somehow she'd managed to push the door open to the rest of the house. she managed to sniff around, jump on my couch, and then sniff out the bowl of left over halloween candy sitting on my side table. i noticed the open door immediately, walked into the living room, and found her whining, lying on the couch surrounded by candy bar wrappers. the little runt ate about 2 or 3 milkway bars and a bunch of kitkat bars. i immediately freaked out and called my boyfriend whose mom is a vet. he speed dialed his mom to find out what i needed to do to help take care of the dog. apparently, milk chocolate isn't deadly to dogs. it is pure dark chocolate that is the problem. however, my boyfriend's mom told me to get ready for a poop and vomit storm like i had never seen before. and boy was she right! i have never seen such awful, powerful liquids come out of such a tiny little dog. i sat with her almost all night while she alternated between vomiting chocolate and wrappers and crapping liquid diarrhea. the smell. my god, the smell. i dry heave still just thinking about it. lesson learned... dog proof all areas of the house, even if you think they are impenetrable!

    Here is the summary: left a door open by mistake. dog opened the door and found a bowl of chocolate. ate chocolate. commence vomit and poo storm that lasted several hours.

    Here is the article: sorry for the layout- i'm on mobile.

okay. so.... here goes.

i work full time remanufacturing pianos, and some of the stuff we have to do is refinishing. now, if you know anything about refinishing, you know what messy work it is. you get paint and lacquer everywhere. all over your hands and shit. 

so here's how my fuck up unfolded. 

this particular day, i had to finish the outside of a case with some thick ass lacquer before i headed off to my first tuning at 11. so i come in, load up my paint gun with the stuff, put 2 coats on, and step back to let it dry. in my haste, i had forgotten to put on gloves, so i had lacquer all over my hands. i realized that if i showed up for a tuning covered in this shit, the woman i was tuning for would throw her little 3 pound attack dog at me. 

now, lacquer can't be just washed off. you have to use thinner. which is incredibly  flammible. so i go over to our cabinet of chemicals and whatnot, grab out the thinner, and pour some in a bowl to start washing my hands. 

after the lacquer has been washed off my hands, i look at the time. it's 10:40. 

fuck.

so i wipe my hands on my pants and leave the shop to go to my tuning. 

now i'm panicking because i'm so late. so i decide it's time for a cigarette. 

friends, this is where i fucked up.

i hadn't gotten all the thinner off my hands. so when i went to light my cigarette, my left hand burst into flame.

 it went something like this:

"fuck i can't believe i'm this late... god damn it... son of a bitch... yep. i need one of you little fuckers. mhmm."

*click, whoomf*

"shitshitshitshitshitfuckballsohfuckohfuckohfuckohfuck"

in my panicked state, i wiped my hands on my pants again. where there was more thinner. 

so now my pants are on fire. 

i rolled out of my car into the snow screaming like a little bitch. 

after rolling around,  i got the fire out and sat there in the snow. my leg hair singed off, my pants ruined. i grabbed my lighter and lit that cigarette again. this time i didn't catch fire. now i'm at home in an ice bath.

    Here is the summary: : don't smoke with lacquer thinner on your hands and pants.

    Here is the article: so this just happened this weekend. it was my friends birthday party  and rougly 10 of us gathered at her house to celebrate it. there was this girl at the party. lets call her jenna. me and jenna knew each other and were pretty good friends. the only thing was that i was really in love with her.

fast forward a couple of hours, we started getting pretty drunk, then all of a sudden jenna started kissing me, and biting me on my cheek etc. jenna would constantly ask who i like, and i would be beta as fuck and say "no one". jenna would ask me other questions as well, such as, how long is it? and i would say " i don't know" 

30 minutes later, we went to the bedroom, she would constantly say that she isnt beautiful and that no one loves her. i tried helping her and saying that i love her, she would then reply " yeah but you like me only as a friend"

looking back i feel like a idiot for not taking any hints or whatsoever.

    Here is the summary: was at a birthday party, the girl that i loved tried to hint to me all the time that she wanted to fuck, but as the beta male i am, i didn't take the hint...

    Here is the article: so this just happened this weekend. it was my friends birthday party  and rougly 10 of us gathered at her house to celebrate it. there was this girl at the party. lets call her jenna. me and jenna knew each other and were pretty good friends. the only thing was that i was really in love with her.

fast forward a couple of hours, we started getting pretty drunk, then all of a sudden jenna started kissing me, and biting me on my cheek etc. jenna would constantly ask who i like, and i would be beta as fuck and say "no one". jenna would ask me other questions as well, such as, how long is it? and i would say " i don't know" 

30 minutes later, we went to the bedroom, she would constantly say that she isnt beautiful and that no one loves her. i tried helping her and saying that i love her, she would then reply " yeah but you like me only as a friend"

looking back i feel like a idiot for not taking any hints or whatsoever.

i had been courting this female for about a month, lets call her ally, she lived about half hour away in a more "country" area of the state. so one night i'm at my house drinking with some buddies, and she calls me and says i should come to this party out near her house. i was dying to get laid, and decided this is probably going to be my only chance, like ever. so i leave all my friends, and head for the land of vaginal dreams. mind you i'm pretty wasted at this point, but im fiending for the poon, other wise i would never drive drunk....ok so anyway i get out to the house and its in one of these housing developments where every house looks identical. i park down the road, ally comes out and we start making out like two lesbians at an elton john concert, and she brings me inside. we go upstairs and start to fool around, but her morbidly obese friend needed ally to take her back home to krispy kreme. so i walk ally out to her car, and she tells me to wait at the party, she'll be back in 20 mins. here's the fuck up, i walk up to what i assumed was the house, and head on in. i open the door and it's very dark, the floor layout appears to be identical to the house i had just been in, yet there are no people. i head in the living room and see a thirty something yr old woman in the corner on her computer, still not realizing i'm obviously in the wrong house, i drunkenly shout "where's the party at" and she screams bloody murder and starts grabbing her hair and flailing her arms and shit, i then say something like "what, where did everybody go" when i see a very large man come from out of the kitchen, he is heading at me full speed, and he lays a solid right hook directly to my small little face. i fall, and he stands above me, i get up, and out of drunken anger i say wait, then, i spit in this mans face and bolt. i ran for probably 3 miles, as fast as fucking possible. i don't know if he chased me, i was too afraid to look back. i dove in some bushes and slept there, found my car the next morning, and never spoke to ally again.

    Here is the summary: drunkenly walked into the wrong house, scared woman, got punched, then spit in the guy's face, ruining a sure chance to get laid.

    Here is the article: today, i was going for a quick 20 minute run before my workout. as i was running i had the urge to spit come up. now when your mouth is dry and you need to spit, your spit becomes sticky and hard to get out easily. so i knew i had to lean over to spit out to avoid getting it onto myself. i also didn't want to stop running just to spit so i tried to do it in one quick lean-spit motion. well i was wearing these [earbuds](http://www1.pcmag.com/media/images/286353-soul-by-ludacris-sl99-275width.jpg) and the wires on these things are stiff and fall out easily. so as i went to go spit, the right earbud fell out of my ear and caught the spit mid air and flung it back onto the left side of my shorts. i immediately stopped running and tried to get it off but couldn't. i switched to my earbud to clean it before putting it back in my ear and when i saw the damage of the spit to my shorts, it was white so it looked like man juice got all over my shorts. needless to say i ended up working out back at my dorm.

normally, i wouldn't be on my phone at dinner, but being at the kids table i assumed it would be fine. i ate halfheartedly whilst texting when my cousin asked "are you even *eating?*" to which i showed him my half eaten burger.

"are **you** even eating?" i asked jokingly. his jimmies seemed pretty rustled. 

"i already ate my hot dog!" he exclaimed.

"oh yeah? prove it."

keep in mind, my cousin is 7 years old, and i find humor in messing with him. now i don't know how, but he apparently knew how to make himself puke, and was intent on proving he ate a hotdog. 

i watched first in confusion, and then in horror as he made his way to the middle of the room, stuck two fingers down his throat, and proceeded to continue until he was uncontrollably puking.

normally, i wouldn't be on my phone at dinner, but being at the kids table i assumed it would be fine. i ate halfheartedly whilst texting when my cousin asked "are you even *eating?*" to which i showed him my half eaten burger.

"are **you** even eating?" i asked jokingly. his jimmies seemed pretty rustled. 

"i already ate my hot dog!" he exclaimed.

"oh yeah? prove it."

keep in mind, my cousin is 7 years old, and i find humor in messing with him. now i don't know how, but he apparently knew how to make himself puke, and was intent on proving he ate a hotdog. 

i watched first in confusion, and then in horror as he made his way to the middle of the room, stuck two fingers down his throat, and proceeded to continue until he was uncontrollably puking.

    Here is the summary: I was at a dinner party with my cousins in California.

    Here is the article: preface:

my isp is awesome. they don't care what people download from where, no questions, no throttling, great speeds. i use it to do depraved shit like torrent pornography. 

the fuckup:

i do some work for my in laws, occasionally i need to get onto their computer to check things and do routine maintenance.

well i opened a vpn to their computer, and checked on something for them and did not even think about what i was downloading on my personal machine. lo and behold 10 days later (today) the mother in law gets a dmca takedown notice for 'bad girls 5', she immediately questions my wife who questions me and now i feel sheepish and horrified. 

so... there's an option with vpns to not use the remote host as a default gateway. and that's enabled now :)

    Here is the summary: don't send all your torrent traffic through a vpn and get your in laws fined/arrested.

    Here is the article: so, this fuck-up actually happened exactly a week ago, on the 25th. i got back from volunteering, and i was about to cool down and take a nap. but then i text my best friend/girlfriend and start talking a bit about stress and school and things like that. recently, my gpa dropped to 2.83 and i was feeling pretty down about everything. then, feeling a bit mischievous, i switch to caps lock and start somewhat-jokingly start "ranting" about how upset i am that i didn't get a birthday present, as her birthday was coming up and i was thinking of something to get her. somewhere along the way, it becomes an actual rant, but in a really passive-*aggressive* way, *extra* emphasis on aggressive. i had a million opportunities to turn back at this point, but i just fucking plow on like a jihadist ready to blow up a target. she reasonably becomes very upset, and stops texting me after some time, but at this point i have no idea what exactly i did. fast forward to monday. i try to say hi, and then she says "we need to talk." at this point, i somehow realize that i'm screwed in some way. basically she tells me that i really hurt her with what i said and how i couldn't trust her to tell how i was feeling, and that she couldn't afford to stay with me if i kept on acting like this. i try to defend myself, but everything i say comes off an excuse. hell, everything i said probably was an excuse. and with that, she breaks up with me. now at this point, i'm pretty much just shocked and insensitive that i lost my girlfriend, but i am downright *furious* with myself for betraying the feelings and absolute trust of my best friend. she did nothing to deserve what i did that night. all she ever did was support and love me, and be adorable and beautiful, and i repay her with this. the following week sort of fucking sucked in almost every way possible and what not. i did try to apologize wednesday, but she wouldn't have it, understandably. i mean, i sort of did really hurt her and betrayed her absolute faith in me and all. and yesterday, with the prompting of my 25-year licensed psychotherapist mother, i half-heartedly tried to check up on her and ask how she was doing via text, but i got shot down with a "fuck off", which in itself is another small tifu. at this point, i've just accepted that it will take a really really long time before she'll even talk to me again, so i'm putting my faith in time and the idea that everything changes.

    Here is the article: this one happened about one or two years ago.

one saturday morning, after my mother returned from taking the dog out on a walk, she said the weather was so nice and i should go outside and have some fun. she pointed towards a pile of twigs and branches which had to be thrown out anyway, and she noted that i was allowed to burn them in the wheelbarrow. i, for one, love making fires and i ran outside to collect matches, the wheelbarrow to build the fire in, and old newspapers to get the fire going. 

after a couple of innocent tries, i was still unable to get the branches to burn. normally i do quite well with fires but it wasn’t happening today. i guess the branches were still kind of moistened by the rain a couple days ago. i decided it was time to bring out the big guns and i went into the pantry to get the cleaning fluid, which is highly flammable. i poured just a little onto the twigs and old newspapers, covering the opening of the bottle with my thumb, before lighting it with a match. still no success, the newspaper would of course burn, but i could not get the twigs to catch fire. afterwards, i poured even more onto the burning newspaper which was still flaming from the first try. 

that was where it all went south. 

for some reason i thought it was a good idea to remove my thumb from the opening and allow a large amount of fluid to flow out while there were still some flames here and there. the fire suddenly barked at me, creating an enormous burst of fire, which shot all the way into the bottle with the cleaning fluid i was holding, causing it to catch fire. i watched it burn for a few seconds, in the bottle in my hand, and decided to try and blow it out. i should’ve just covered the bottleneck with something so the oxygen would run out, but my mind was in panic and i did not think of that. instead, i reflexed by throwing the bottle away. 

well… that created several burning patches on the grass and stone walkway. some of the flames reached up to three feet into the air. i even almost burned down the outdoor chairs and table on our terrace.  i tried to kick some of the patches out, but ended up with burning shoes several times from the cleaning fluid that stuck to my feet and trousers but luckily, i managed to stop myself from burning. now all i could do was wait for all of it to burn out. some patches were stopped by me kicking them and other patches were stopped by the fuel burning out. all i could think of was ‘’i hope my mom or my dad doesn’t look outside while i’m standing surrounded by fire in our garden’’. 

after all was burned out, and the bottle which held the cleaning fluid had morphed into something that could not be recognized as a bottle, i went inside to tell my mom what happened. she sent me to my dad, who was sitting in the living room and had already overheard the story when i told it to mom. at first, of course, he responded angrily, but after a few seconds he asked me if i was okay and he realized it was just an accident. i led him to the scene of the crime and walked him through all the events that occurred in that very garden. after evaluating, he asked me to go to the forest next to our house and collect some new twigs so we could start building a proper fire.

    Here is the summary: tried to build a fire in the wheelbarrow using cleaning fluid, cleaning fluid caught fire, so did the garden.

    Here is the article: i was sitting at my desk at work when i begin to feel this...well, this disruptive gurgle in my gut. eh, whatever, it should go away, i deal with this everyday (my diet sucks). well, i have a meeting in about 15 min....buuuuut i bet it will be gone by then, usually goes away if i just tough it out. 

uhhhh, no. within seconds my stomach begins to churn worse. i'm breathing in and out heavily, trying to relax my body enough to rid my guts of this pain caused by fowl shit and methane build up which i can tell is rapidly building like a time-lapsed cloud front moving in. 

i begin to feel hot, then cold, then hot and sweaty again. as i sit there hoping it's going to go away, i'm approached by the co-worker (higher up but not my boss) i have a meeting with. "oh hey jdubstrut, can we get together now?"
i'm fucking sweating bullets, my face is red and my fucking gut feels like it has 18 pounds of liquid shit i need to get rid of. 

me-"can i have a few min. to run to the bathroom"? 
her-"sure come find me in my office when you're ready".

whew, i dodged that bullet. well at this point i know i'm in the danger zone (kenny loggins). it's no longer in my gut, it's actually migrated itself into to last few inches of my butthole wanting to come out. i scramble across the building to the closest bathroom. 

let me add some context here, the bathroom door is literally no more than 10 feet away from a cubicle pod full of women. i've been in and out of this bathroom hundreds of times and they never pay attention to who goes in or who comes out.---remember this.

i pull the door open and use my hand on the handle for leverage to throw myself in the bathroom and into the stall. i pull my pants down and boom, before my ass cheeks even hit the lid it's like someone turned a faucet on. it sounds like a fucking warzone in this bowl. i let out a big sigh of relief as at this point this is the best shit i have ever taken (which will be trumped by a future close call shit). then, i hear the door of the bathroom finally close (it's on a hinge that keeps the door from slamming by slowly closing). oh fuck, there's is zero chance they didn't hear that barrage of liquid and exploding shit coming from my brown eye. i clean myself up, wash my hands, and proceed to walk out of the door.

well, remember when i told you they never pay attention to who comes in and out? well apparently i was right about how loud it was and i walked out of the bathroom to all 4 women slyly peaking over the cubicle walls to witness who this destroyer of porcelain could be. i gave them a little smirk and quickly hustled back to my desk. there is no way that this "event" can/will be forgotten for a while. if i wasn't so embarrassed i'd be proud.

    Here is the summary: had to shit really bad, ran to the bathroom, didn't give the door time to close before i let loose satan's spawn out of my ass, will be know as "that guy" with the exploding shits.

    You will be given one summary written for a news article. Your task is to rate the summary based on the following criteria:
    Output format: PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE

    Evaluation Criteria:
    1. Read the news article carefully and identify the main topic and key points.
    2. Read the summary and compare it to the news article. Check if the summary covers the main topic and key points of the news article, and if it resents them in a clear and logical order.
    3. Rate the summary with 5 percentages, where each one represents how likely the summary is going to get a score from 1 to 5. For example, if you think the summary is 80% likely to get a score of 5, 10% likely to get a score of 4, 5% likely to get a score of 3, 3% likely to get a score of 2, and 1% likely to get a score of 1, you should rate the summary as 80, 10, 5, 3, 2.

uhhhh, no. within seconds my stomach begins to churn worse. i'm breathing in and out heavily, trying to relax my body enough to rid my guts of this pain caused by fowl shit and methane build up which i can tell is rapidly building like a time-lapsed cloud front moving in. 

i begin to feel hot, then cold, then hot and sweaty again. as i sit there hoping it's going to go away, i'm approached by the co-worker (higher up but not my boss) i have a meeting with. "oh hey jdubstrut, can we get together now?"

    Here is the article: just to give a backstory. my gf and i have been dating for about 2 years. she's very shy and quirky, a little bit naive cause her parents are hugely overprotective, so at times i like mess with her a little. just give her a hard time cause i love her you know? lol

anyways.
we're going out to dinner last night. fancy place here in ky, i put on my nice collared shirt, she wears this sexy little dress. well she wants to try to drive my manual pickup and i think it'll be a hoot so i say why not.
we jump in and she kills it the first time. which isn't bad, but when she does it again she gets down on herself and wants to quit. i talk her into going again and we get outta the driveway. then we're outta the culdesac and by the time we hit the highway she's cruising along with a big smile.

here's the fun. yet painfully horrid part.
me: "ya know these model trucks have got a special gear." wink wink

her: "oh really?"

me: "oh yea. see the r gear? that's the racing gear. once you get to fifth, and you really wanna go, just slam it into that one and you'll take off."

her: "you're screwing with me..."

i just laughed and we kept driving along.

well... five minutes later i look over and she rips that damn gear shift down like an angry antifa pulling down a pro-trump sign. you can guess the rest, my truck spits screams and shits out the transy like bad indian food. 
so now i'm stuck at home today. missing work, probably gonna miss most of next week too, probably gonna get fired. no longer have a vehicle. my gf is pretty pissed at me. gotta pay a fortune in towing. life is good. life is good.

goddamn am i an idiot

    Here is the article: so my friend has been telling me about this show for a while now, everyone everywhere around me is talking about it. so i finally got around to starting it. my boyfriend and i settle in front of the tv, turn on netflix, find stranger things, and get ready to start.
now we share an account with a friend, and clearly said friend had already watched the season before. careful not to read any episode summaries, look too long as the screenshots, (everything possible to avoid any spoilers whatsoever), i select "start from beginning" and stranger things starts.
at first we were a little confused, but being based on a lot of stephen king's work, we went with it thinking it was probably all part of the plot. we tried to make out what the story was about, trying to make links between characters, etc..
episode finishes, we're completely hooked.
i found it funny that netflix had not suggested the second episode, i start looking around, only to realize we watched the season finale of the show. 
there were not a lot of words to express how angry i was at myself at that moment. not to mention we were out of time because of plans and couldn't watch another episode in time. 
so yeh - we're really looking forward to the surprises of season 2.

    Here is the article: technically this happened last night. before getting to the story, there is a little background. 

there's this girl at work who's been interning with the company i work at for the last couple months. i have always thought she was really cute and sometimes felt like she was flirting with me, but was never sure. well, finally we started hanging out last week and it turns out she is most definitely interested in me. we hung out almost every day from last week until last night.  i was really happy where things were going. you know that tingly feeling you get when you're around someone that likes you back and it just feels great? it was like that all the time. 

anyway, the main thing is what i did to mess this up. i was making dinner last night as i've done every night in my effort to woo this girl. somehow out of nowhere, a mosquito comes down and starts flying around her face. she swats at it and says she hates mosquitos. i was amazed that it hasn't died in the snow yet. as i looked at it in astonishment, i watched as it slowly flew down a couple feet, and went inside the microwave door that was cracked open. as soon as it was in the microwave, i got the brilliant idea to shut the door and nuke it. i did. after cooking for 7 seconds i opened the door of the microwave and found the dead mosquito. i started to laugh, because i also hate mosquitos and, out of all the hundreds i've killed in my life i've never killed one like that. as i was laughing i turned back to this girl to see a look of horror on her face. she was just staring at me as if i was a maniac psychopath. i stopped laughing abruptly; i wasn't sure how this would pan out. after awkwardly trying to make a couple jokes about it, she said that she felt like she should be at home, so she left. i tried to play it cool and not text her about it. but after not hearing from her for two hours i texted her and apologized and tried to get some sort of evidence that she wasn't done with me. she didn't text me back so i eventually fell into a restless sleep. luckily when i woke up, she had texted me back. she texted me back a moderately long message, but unfortunately the  

now i feel like shit and am dreading going back to the office on friday. she sits almost right next to me and her internship doesn't end until january. 

edit: for those here agreeing that it is messed up to laugh at killing an animal, no matter what size, i agree with you. although it probably doesn't mean much, i wasn't laughing because i enjoy killing creatures even if that's how it sounds. i was laughing at the situation of it all. the percent of people on this planet that get to watch a pesky mosquito fly into a microwave is pretty small. i was lucky enough to be one of these people, and situational humor amuses me. i did talk with the intern girl some more about it and i think i convinced her i'm not a psychopath. explaining to her the humor of the situation along with quoting her for saying "i hate mosquitos" right before i did it seems to have put her much more at ease. even if we don't hang out anymore, i know at the very least that work shouldn't be awkward.

    Here is the summary: of that message was "that was a horrible thing to do to an animal. what does that say about you?"

anyway, the main thing is what i did to mess this up. i was making dinner last night as i've done every night in my effort to woo this girl. somehow out of nowhere, a mosquito comes down and starts flying around her face. she swats at it and says she hates mosquitos. i was amazed that it hasn't died in the snow yet. as i looked at it in astonishment, i watched as it slowly flew down a couple feet, and went inside the microwave door that was cracked open. as soon as it was in the microwave, i got the brilliant idea to shut the door and nuke it. i did. after cooking for 7 seconds i opened the door of the microwave and found the dead mosquito. i started to laugh, because i also hate mosquitos and, out of all the hundreds i've killed in my life i've never killed one like that. as i was laughing i turned back to this girl to see a look of horror on her face. she was just staring at me as if i was a maniac psychopath. i stopped laughing abruptly; i wasn't sure how this would pan out. after awkwardly trying to make a couple jokes about it, she said that she felt like she should be at home, so she left. i tried to play it cool and not text her about it. but after not hearing from her for two hours i texted her and apologized and tried to get some sort of evidence that she wasn't done with me. she didn't text me back so i eventually fell into a restless sleep. luckily when i woke up, she had texted me back. she texted me back a moderately long message, but unfortunately the  

now i feel like shit and am dreading going back to the office on friday. she sits almost right next to me and her internship doesn't end until january. 

edit: for those here agreeing that it is messed up to laugh at killing an animal, no matter what size, i agree with you. although it probably doesn't mean much, i wasn't laughing because i enjoy killing creatures even if that's how it sounds. i was laughing at the situation of it all. the percent of people on this planet that get to watch a pesky mosquito fly into a microwave is pretty small. i was lucky enough to be one of these people, and situational humor amuses me. i did talk with the intern girl some more about it and i think i convinced her i'm not a psychopath. explaining to her the humor of the situation along with quoting her for saying "i hate mosquitos" right before i did it seems to have put her much more at ease. even if we don't hang out anymore, i know at the very least that work shouldn't be awkward.

    Here is the summary: I was making dinner last night as I've done every night in my effort to woo this girl.

    Here is the article: let me start off by saying that i'm feeling not super great about who i am at the moment and fully recognize that i have screwed up in a massive way. 

a short time ago i moved to a new state, i somehow managed to completely out of the blue find a room to rent in a house that was an ideal location and a live-in landlord. we had chatted and exchanged numbers a couple months beforehand and had really built up a fast friendship, we were basically best friends before we had moved in together. he even full admits that there is much brolove between the two of us, with us mutually agreeing that we're both basically best friends and just a hint of hollywood-gay for one another. we'll call him "joe", and boy is he an awesome dude. 

joe and i are both single, eligible bachelors, and shortly after moving in we both started long term relationships, we'll call my gf "molly" and his gf "marie" (thankfully she knows the difference between rocks and minerals). we all sort of basically became fast friends and really enjoyed the time we spend together, and have been having a great time since. well, until a few months ago when molly dumped me and i took it really hard, and have been trying to deal with it. molly was very special to me because she was very sexually open and experienced, especially in dominance, submission, and bondage. she brought the dom out of me as she was extremely submissive, we had a great time and i don't hold any ill will towards her, but i sure as hell miss her and the great sex. we fully embraced the lifestyle and now i cannot imagine my sex life with a lot of d/s dynamic to it, it's just what i enjoy and that's what i want. marie is really awesome as well, she's an excellent cook, has steady work and is accomplished, and is someone i have come to and confided and feel a deep intimacy with. she's also crazy sexy and a ton of fun, but that's my best bud's gf so she's off limits, but damn is she a cool chick and just the easiest to talk to and so understanding. i really care for her and have sat down so she could vent at me and i vent at her, we have a great dynamic in the house.

until tonight. so joe wasn't feeling too well and went to bed really early, both me and marie are sitting around smoking a little pot, drinking a little hard liquor. we both had kind of a crappy day and just wanted to talk it out, and like i said, we're about as intimate as two friends get so there really was no off limit subject. a few drinks and puffs in we're both complaining about our relationships, mine the lack thereof. i talked about how hard it is to find women who are into true dom/sub stuff and bondage but only within a certain dynamic and all the stuff that me and the ex used to do. basically marie starts complaining that joe is very vanilla, how unsatisfied and sexually frustrated she is, and how he doesn't dominate her the way she desires, which turns out to be the way that *i* desire the dynamic to be; all about mutual respect, total openness, and true intimacy through bdsm, very light on the humiliation but still strict. i like to say i'm a very compassionate and caring but strict dom who tries to empower his subs to explore, and the same to himself, not necessarily as a 24/7 thing but definitely frequent. 

we basically talked for hours about it, marie seemed absolutely fascinated by the idea, her face lit up, she kept saying yes that's so amazing when i talked about all the fun me and molly had had. marie even started crying at one point and i felt bad, i hugged her and there was something...odd about it. she seemed to embrace me with her whole body, even sniffing my neck. next thing i know her face is firmly planted on mine, we're stripping off clothes, she's grabbing me, all kinds of stuff is happening. it took me about 30 seconds to realize, "oh shit, this is totally fucked", and told the very much naked, fingering herself, marie, begging for "sir" to treat her "like the filthy cum slut that molly was", that this had gotten out of hand. 

we reclothed and i basically held her hand as she sobbed and said she was sorry, that she was glad we hadn't done anything, but that she was completely unsatisfied in her relationship and how that she knew about all the great sex me and molly had because molly had apparently described it to her in detail (which pissed me off a little, i may be into a certain "lifestyle" but it's my private sex life, whatever). 

then things got *really* weird, the dynamic between us completely changed on the dime, something just took over inside me as i looked deeply into her beautiful eyes, at this woman who i had previously only had a passing sexual desire for but had built this incredibly intimate and dynamic relationship with, and i felt *desired*, *powerful*, and most importantly *accepted*. not everyone is into what i'm into, and here was this woman whom i cared about deeply standing in front of me, begging for me to do what we both wanted so badly. for some reason, i don't know why, and however foolishly, i decided to push her limits and see just how submissive she was. i put both my hands around her neck, my fingers laced on the back, thumbs under her chin parallel to her larynx, only very lightly applying pressure, and kept looking into her eyes, bringing her face close enough to mine to feel the breath. "how can i look at you", i said, "and say to you that even though you're dating my best friend, someone i admire and adore, that you deserve better." she was ecstatic to say the least, and i could tell she was a little embarrassed about it, i told her to look me in the eye and tell me how long she had wanted me. "six months". wow. 

i told her whatever happens she needs to respect both i and joe, that this was not going to happen as things stood and that a hard rain was going to fall, and one day soon. this needed to get resolved, and she had to do it on her own. i was not going to come to her rescue, because that crap never works out. the way i went about it though, it was *highly* sexually charged, and was definitely me in the role of dom and her the role of sub. after the conversation was done i even told her to clean the plate of food i had been eating, and that i was gong to bed. she replied, "yes, sir", and tried rather sheepishly to run her hand up my thigh to my crotch. before she reached it, i grabbed her wrist and pulled her close to me, whispering with complete seriousness, "no. touching. now i'm going to bed, you deal with this."

so yeah. now i'm not sure what to do, but damn was that fucking hot. 

edit:

    Here is the summary: she's my best friends girl, and she wants to be mine. especially with a collar around her neck.

    Here is the article: so this happened a month or two ago when the whole eating tide pods meme was in full swing.

i was in a good mood so i was joking around and memeing(?) fairly hard with my boyfriend in his apartment after our classes (we're both college students). i put a video on my snapchat of me handing him one of those boxes fast food restaurants put burgers in, showing him opening the lid, the box being full of tide pods, and him popping one in his mouth before the video cuts off. just being a dumbass in general, the usual.

anyway, i know the meme started because a lot of people thought tide pods look appetizing because of the bright colors and gummy-like texture, but i mostly just get the urge to pop them like bubble wrap. it seemed super satisfying to squeeze it and have the colors burst or whatever so i gave in and went to try and pop one in the sink. side note-- those motherfuckers are tough. most of you rational reddit users probably haven't attempted to, but if you ever feel the need, just know that it takes more than a limp squeeze to burst them open.

so i fully extend my lanky arm, my fist closed around the tide pod at the bottom of the sink and my face as far away as physically allowed, and try for a few minutes gently pop it. that doesn't do shit, so i say fuck it and squeeze as hard as i possibly can. yah, big mistake.

next thing i know the tide pod projectile explodes directly into my face, so quickly and with such force that i didn't have time to shut my eyes or mouth. i immediately scream bloody murder and take the sink extender sprayer thing to hose my face while trying to keep my eyes open enough to flush them out. i didn't know before but tide pods are essentially super concentrated detergent poison from hell. i sprayed my face for about an hour (drenching my clothes and the kitchen) before i could see well enough to get in the shower. it felt like satan pissed in my eyes and for the next 48 hours they were bloodshot and burning and my skin was raw and sensitive to the touch, similar to a sunburn. my boyfriend said if he hadn't been initially concerned that i was going to die or go blind that he would have been on the floor laughing because i'm such an idiot. don't do tide pods, kids

    Here is the summary: i went to pop a tide pod in the sink because i'm an idiot. it projectile exploded in my face and was extremely painful.

    Output format: PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE

    Evaluation Criteria:
    1. Read the news article carefully and identify the main topic and key points.
    2. Read the summary and compare it to the news article. Check if the summary covers the main topic and key points of the news article, and if it resents them in a clear and logical order.
    3. Rate the summary with 5 percentages, where each one represents how likely the summary is going to get a score from 1 to 5. For example, if you think the summary is 80% likely to get a score of 5, 10% likely to get a score of 4, 5% likely to get a score of 3, 3% likely to get a score of 2, and 1% likely to get a score of 1, you should rate the summary as 80, 10, 5, 3, 2.

    Here is the article: so this happened a month or two ago when the whole eating tide pods meme was in full swing.

i was in a good mood so i was joking around and memeing(?) fairly hard with my boyfriend in his apartment after our classes (we're both college students). i put a video on my snapchat of me handing him one of those boxes fast food restaurants put burgers in, showing him opening the lid, the box being full of tide pods, and him popping one in his mouth before the video cuts off. just being a dumbass in general, the usual.

anyway, i know the meme started because a lot of people thought tide pods look appetizing because of the bright colors and gummy-like texture, but i mostly just get the urge to pop them like bubble wrap. it seemed super satisfying to squeeze it and have the colors burst or whatever so i gave in and went to try and pop one in the sink. side note-- those motherfuckers are tough. most of you rational reddit users probably haven't attempted to, but if you ever feel the need, just know that it takes more than a limp squeeze to burst them open.

so i fully extend my lanky arm, my fist closed around the tide pod at the bottom of the sink and my face as far away as physically allowed, and try for a few minutes gently pop it. that doesn't do shit, so i say fuck it and squeeze as hard as i possibly can. yah, big mistake.

next thing i know the tide pod projectile explodes directly into my face, so quickly and with such force that i didn't have time to shut my eyes or mouth. i immediately scream bloody murder and take the sink extender sprayer thing to hose my face while trying to keep my eyes open enough to flush them out. i didn't know before but tide pods are essentially super concentrated detergent poison from hell. i sprayed my face for about an hour (drenching my clothes and the kitchen) before i could see well enough to get in the shower. it felt like satan pissed in my eyes and for the next 48 hours they were bloodshot and burning and my skin was raw and sensitive to the touch, similar to a sunburn. my boyfriend said if he hadn't been initially concerned that i was going to die or go blind that he would have been on the floor laughing because i'm such an idiot. don't do tide pods, kids

    Here is the article: to start this off, i didn't fuck up today.  rather, my assistance was required about 9 months ago.  i was still in high school back then and a friend and i had a meeting with a guidance counsellor to discuss our senior project (a project that every senior needs to complete.  it can be anything as long as it takes 60 hours.).  so once we finished discussing that, she asked us if we knew anything about snapchat.  we told her we did and she started asking us questions.  "how do you use it?", "can anyone else see what you send?", "is it secure?"  we answered all of her questions as best we could and then left the meeting.  we just assumed that her boyfriend, a teacher at our high school, was getting some nude pictures.  we made a few jokes about it, then kind of forgot about it.  that is, until recently. today, a news story from our home town revealed that a faculty member was engaging in inappropriate sexual acts with a student.  well, you probably guessed it.  the guidance counsellor who we taught to use snapchat was using it to send nude pictures to one of her students.  he is 18, but it is still illegal, so i guess that i fucked up.

edit: newspaper article in the comments for proof.

    Here is the article: we had a big ice storm in maine yesterday. everything is covered in ice. so, i get to scraping the van way early so we can get to a christmas eve service on time. 

after about fifteen minutes, i finally get the car clear enough to drive and head inside. when it comes time to go, the rear sliding doors won't open because of the ice buildup on the rear quarter of the car. i start smacking it with the palm of my hand and happen to catch the corner of the window causing it to shatter.

so we then had to pile into the other car and were late. and now i've got duct tape and card board over the opening with about a foot of snow and more ice coming tomorrow.

i'm pretty sure that with the wind and the storm, i'm going to have a foot of snow in the back of my van.

merry christmas!

    Here is the article: i'm 17, and a few weeks ago i was hanging out with my girlfriend of a few months. she has a bit of a passion for weed, but i'm a nerdy redditor-type, so i have less experience. i had a problem where, even though i was *100% positive* that i was smoking properly, holding it in my lungs and everything, i would barely get high. over time, it started working more and more, so the both of us assumed that smoking frequently would allow me to experience it more.

so, we sat down by the side of her parents' apartment, where nobody was likely to see us, and started cheeching it up. assuming that i still had a tolerance, we figured it would be okay for me to smoke an entire bowl from her largest bong in one hit. 

this was a mistake.

i immediately started hacking and wheezing, my throat was burning worse than it ever had before. she patted my back to help me get it all out, but i can't say that it helped much. i asked for a place to puke, and she pointed to a remote location. after a few minutes of retching in vain, i started walking back.

this is when i started experiencing my first real symptoms, and they were fairly intense. my heart was pounding, my chest hurt, my vision was distorted, and everything was in slow motion; more specifically, everything looked like it was 100 fps and had some sort of weird stuttering effect. this was very unpleasant, but i felt i might be able to wait it out. 

it wasn't until i started getting a headache that it started to turn into a nightmare; i heard this terrible, pulsating, electronic noise, like you might expect to hear if you got hit in an atari game or some shit, and it synced up with my pounding heartbeat and stuttering vision. it was so painful, it felt like a migraine. i kept asking my girlfriend if she had ever gotten this high and felt this terrible, and while she kept saying yes, i could see the fucking horror in her eyes. 

given my heightened anxiety, it felt like my brain was failing, so i assumed that it was conflicting with my medication. even worse, i thought that it might be triggering mental illness; it wasn't likely, but it's possible, and my family has a history of poor mental health. either way, i assumed that i was dying and my entire life flashed before my eyes, until the high got so intense that i couldn't remember most of it.

i can't remember a lot of what happened next, but according to my girlfriend, i tugged at her shirt and said "call an ambulance call an ambulance call an ambulance" until she conceded. i remember the 911 call though; i was unresponsive on the floor, and she mentioned that all the color had left my face. i was convinced that she would run away and leave me there after finishing the call. even though it has been 2 minutes or so, it felt like 20.

the next 2 hours was a blur of paramedics cleaning up a puke puddle in front of my gf's apartment, police officers telling me that i was incredibly stupid, paramedics in the ambulance telling me that i was dying because they thought it was funny, and amused patients in the waiting room asking me if i smoked crystal meth. at one point, i told a doctor that i thought i would be "permanently retarded," before realizing that it isn't socially acceptable to say retarded and apologizing. 

it was a pretty embarrassing experience, but the anxiety probably would've grown into something even worse if i tried waiting it out at her house, so i'm grateful for the ambulance. my dad told me to be more careful, but was pretty forgiving, even after i puked in front of him a few times. my girlfriend texted me and told me that there might have been a few shreds of tobacco in the bowl (which tends to make the high a lot more aggressive), but that it probably wasn't enough to cause a problem.

later on, i met up with my gf and was still fairly shaken up by the whole thing, so i was acting pretty reserved and quiet. on another occasion, she told me that she "wanted to talk", and while she didn't talk about anything serious, the way she built it up over the course of 15 hours made me think she was going to dump me, so i wasn't being very emotive and felt a bit bitter. so today, i got a text from her telling me that it was over. she felt that we weren't clicking anymore, based on those two nights. i don't entirely blame her, but it was pretty fucked up to dump me via text after something like that.

    Here is the summary: took a devastating bong rip, got too fucked up, ambulance got called on me, girlfriend dumped me.

    Here is the article: it was actually yesterday, but it wasn't until i calmed down and the dust settled that i was able to put this into words.

i was in the r hand lane of a 4 lane highway, when i got passed on the shoulder by a little pickup truck with 3 younger guys in it. (this is in the us, also a very dangerous move, but i digress) i showed my displeasure by flipping them off. not the smartest move, but they did piss me off. so once they got in front of me on a 65mph stretch of highway, they slowed down, slowing me down along with all of the traffic behind me. they kept blocking me and other cars from passing, while throwing crap out of their car at me, hanging out the window and yelling stuff at me. 

what the little turds didn't realize is that i was on the phone with 911 giving them a full description of them, their truck, the licence plate, and everything else. 

i live off the main highway. i was willing to give up contact with these cretins and just go home. until they decided to (they were ahead of me at this point) turn down the road to my house. now there was no way i was going to stop and let them know where i lived, so i called a buddy in the sheriff's office and filled him in. i also kept following them. when he came up behind me and said to leave him some room, i did, and he whipped around me, lit up the truck, and pulled them over. i pulled over too.

all hell broke loose. the oldest one was 19. the 15 and 16 year olds were released to their parents, who had to pick them up in the middle of nowhere. the 19 year old driver (truck was in daddy's name) was ticketed for failure to stop at a stop sign, which my favorite deputy witnessed, and too much tint on the windows. 

they were claiming they were scared of me and were running away. i drive a beat up pos with a handicapped tag on it. those 3 strapping lads were scared of me? throwing stuff at my vehicle and calling me a pussy? driving like idiots while i tried to tell the dispatcher where they were? and driving a vehicle that was very easy to identify? not smart kiddos.

while i still reserve my right to flip the bird at someone who passes me on the shoulder, i'm too old to be playing cat and mouse with a bunch of teenagers. and now i have to wait for a court date, since charges are filed.

    Here is the summary: little jerks drive like idiots, i drive like a jerk to keep up with them so i can help the cops catch them and press charges on them

    Here is the article: yesterday i decided to lose some weight because i'm getting pretty chubby, and growing some manboobs. perhaps cut down on junk food, walk more, play tennis at school. be more active rather than the sedentary lifestyle i currently have.

so today i decided to go for a walk, it was about four miles, took an hour and a half, and felt great. before i left my parents kept pestering me to not call them if i quit cause they know i will, wow thanks. i didn't tell them about the ulterior motives, just that i wanted to go for a walk and get some fresh air, i assumed it was pretty obvious. when i get back, i was in a great mood, but i was tired, and didn't want to talk too much cause i was tired.

my mom tells me, "you're in a pissy mood, so don't bitch." wow thanks. then my dad pesters me thinking i went out for junk food, or donuts, or soda, or chips, or candy, i really do hate, hattte, being pestered. it's one of my biggest pet peeves. and it was out of character for me to walk for walking's sake. but i insist, i just went out for some fun, passes by my old middle school, my current high school, and got some fresh air.

they then start arguing with me, claiming that i'm being distant, and not eating when they eat, (which mind you, is about an hour after i eat at school, yet they don't want to understand this, and say i should eat even if i'm not hungry. (as if they want me to be fat.))

they claim that i'm not walking for exercise, because i don't give a fuck about my health, goddamn model parents here, but rather because i must be depressed, or scoring drugs. i tell them it's nothing of the sort, and they just can't stop with the accusations and that i should have invited my dad. yet i didn't want to, because both of you guys just pester me 24/7 and i wanted to go at my own pace. they ruined my good mood, and i told them to fuck off. the argument ends with them saying, "we were so nice to you, and all you do is bitch. you act as if it would not be weird for me to spontaneously read a book, and i hate books. and you hate waking. so that's why it's weird."

yet i go out for walks all the time to buy snacks and whatnot. so if i hated it as much as they say, i wouldn't ever do it so often.

    Here is the summary: , went out for a walk to lose some weight, now my parents think i'm scoring drugs, or depressed.

they claim that i'm not walking for exercise, because i don't give a fuck about my health, goddamn model parents here, but rather because i must be depressed, or scoring drugs. i tell them it's nothing of the sort, and they just can't stop with the accusations and that i should have invited my dad. yet i didn't want to, because both of you guys just pester me 24/7 and i wanted to go at my own pace. they ruined my good mood, and i told them to fuck off. the argument ends with them saying, "we were so nice to you, and all you do is bitch. you act as if it would not be weird for me to spontaneously read a book, and i hate books. and you hate waking. so that's why it's weird."

yet i go out for walks all the time to buy snacks and whatnot. so if i hated it as much as they say, i wouldn't ever do it so often.

    Here is the summary: I decided to lose some weight because I'm getting pretty chubby, and growing some manboobs.

    Here is the article: yesterday i decided to lose some weight because i'm getting pretty chubby, and growing some manboobs. perhaps cut down on junk food, walk more, play tennis at school. be more active rather than the sedentary lifestyle i currently have.

so today i decided to go for a walk, it was about four miles, took an hour and a half, and felt great. before i left my parents kept pestering me to not call them if i quit cause they know i will, wow thanks. i didn't tell them about the ulterior motives, just that i wanted to go for a walk and get some fresh air, i assumed it was pretty obvious. when i get back, i was in a great mood, but i was tired, and didn't want to talk too much cause i was tired.

my mom tells me, "you're in a pissy mood, so don't bitch." wow thanks. then my dad pesters me thinking i went out for junk food, or donuts, or soda, or chips, or candy, i really do hate, hattte, being pestered. it's one of my biggest pet peeves. and it was out of character for me to walk for walking's sake. but i insist, i just went out for some fun, passes by my old middle school, my current high school, and got some fresh air.

    Here is the article: i'm a nice guy. i like to spark up conversations and get to know people, but today i chose the wrong way to do it. we had a sub in for our regular teacher (who's a smoke show, but anyways) she had a bowling ball for a stomach and was wearing what looked to be some maternal clothing. after she introduced herself and gave us the plan for the day (study hall...helllllll yeah) she started telling us about herself. then me, sitting in the front row, trying to be interested and responsive i asked 


"so whens the baby due!?"


dead silence.... she leave the room. everyone is looking and me until the quiet girl in the back says " i thought she was pregnant too". the principal comes in and i go out with him, she goes back in and from my friends she didnt say a word the rest of the class. i used my smoothness to get out of a suspension by saying it was a mistake and i truly believed she was pregnant and was trying to converse with her. lesson: never ask if a lady is pregnant unless she tells you, she could just be a fat bitch.

    Here is the summary: asked my non-pregnant substitute teacher when the baby was due.

    Here is the article: yesterday afternoon i had a few twisted tea's in a plastic bag on the beach. i was drinking them while lounging and chatting with a cute, topless female parked on her towel adjacent to mine. immediately after the last can was removed, the bag had enough of my company and flew away. i began chasing it, talking to it, in my buzzed state, coaxing it not to retreat any further. the people watching this unfold were chuckling at my antics. tracking the bag, looking beyond it to see what was coming up, i noticed a man. a naked man. with sunglasses on. striking a pose on his beach blanket. (reminiscent of george's pose in the seinfeld episode in which he learns that the lady at the photo development store is looking at his pictures) i assumed he was watching the bag closing in on his area, since his head was pointing in my direction. i completely expected him to gracefully snatch the bag as it drifted by and hand it to me. i was preparing for an awkward exchange, seeing as how he was completely nude, with exception given to the sunglasses. i was not prepared for the awkwardness that it became. his gaze was averted, and as the bag made its final lunge at freedom, it lifted from the sand and wrapped itself around the unsuspecting, nude man's face, coming to an abrupt stop, tight and outlining perfectly the face of a surprised naked man. he did not immediately react, but seconds later when he reached up and peeled the bag from his face, the two dozen beachgoers in the immediate area were already roaring with laughter. needless to say, but i will say, i was laughing with them, and as he handed me the bag, the look of disapproval was genuine. disapproval and embarrassment. being unable to stifle my inner hysterics, an apology he did not receive. i retreated, as did the humiliated man after packing his things.

    Here is the summary: my bag slapped a naked man in the face on the beach, and it ruined his day.

    Here is the article: so this happened back in 2001. i was 19 years old and another teenager in my church youth group ran away from home. rumors started through her friends that she was with me since she liked me. she was 15 years old. the police found her the following day at the pastors house with the preachers son. somehow her mother was convinced she was with me and i had dropped her off there. i went back and forth to court for 2 years and was looking at 30 years in prison. rape kit showed her hymen was intact still and although there was saliva dna found it did not match my dna. two tests, one done by the state which said inconclusive and one done by private sector which said no match. i was prepared for trial and owed my attorney $1000 still and he told me i should take a plea bargain because he wasn’t going to fight for me with me still owing him money and this sort of offense is frowned upon big time by jurors. i ended up getting scared and took a deal for 6 years deferred adjudication and after that it’s like it never happened is what my attorney and the da said. 

fast forward 6 years:

i have completed probation and no longer have to register as a sex offender. life is grand right? i love to another state and get married and everything is in the past... well not so much.

fast forward another 4 years:

the state i took the deal in changes their law and says i have to register as a sexy offender for life and it’s retro active but i don’t get notified (because ignorance is no excuse and it’s a citizens responsibility to be familiar with the law) i am then arrested in my new home state for failure to register as a sex offender (felony) and facing 10 years in prison. 

fast forward 2 years:

i take a plea bargain again for 5 years probation so i don’t go to jail and end up being released from probation after only 2 years. cool deal right? so now i have a good attorney and he actually gets me removed from the state sex offender registry. but i am still on the original state sex offender registry. i get a court order from the convicting court to remove me from that registry as well but the state says no. i even get a letter from the girl i was accused of having sex with who states it never happened but it’s not admissible now. 

so here i am now wondering when the next surprise will be.

    Here is the summary: i took a plea bargain for a sex crime i didn’t commit and then when it was all behind me it showed up again and now i have been redeemed by not only the victim in the case but also 2 judges but the state won’t honor the orders and remove me from the list again.

    Here is the article: so this happened back in 2001. i was 19 years old and another teenager in my church youth group ran away from home. rumors started through her friends that she was with me since she liked me. she was 15 years old. the police found her the following day at the pastors house with the preachers son. somehow her mother was convinced she was with me and i had dropped her off there. i went back and forth to court for 2 years and was looking at 30 years in prison. rape kit showed her hymen was intact still and although there was saliva dna found it did not match my dna. two tests, one done by the state which said inconclusive and one done by private sector which said no match. i was prepared for trial and owed my attorney $1000 still and he told me i should take a plea bargain because he wasn’t going to fight for me with me still owing him money and this sort of offense is frowned upon big time by jurors. i ended up getting scared and took a deal for 6 years deferred adjudication and after that it’s like it never happened is what my attorney and the da said. 

fast forward 6 years:

i have completed probation and no longer have to register as a sex offender. life is grand right? i love to another state and get married and everything is in the past... well not so much.

fast forward another 4 years:

the state i took the deal in changes their law and says i have to register as a sexy offender for life and it’s retro active but i don’t get notified (because ignorance is no excuse and it’s a citizens responsibility to be familiar with the law) i am then arrested in my new home state for failure to register as a sex offender (felony) and facing 10 years in prison. 

fast forward 2 years:

i take a plea bargain again for 5 years probation so i don’t go to jail and end up being released from probation after only 2 years. cool deal right? so now i have a good attorney and he actually gets me removed from the state sex offender registry. but i am still on the original state sex offender registry. i get a court order from the convicting court to remove me from that registry as well but the state says no. i even get a letter from the girl i was accused of having sex with who states it never happened but it’s not admissible now. 

so here i am now wondering when the next surprise will be.

    Here is the summary: I was accused of having sex with a 15 year old girl who ran away from home.

    Here is the article: i had just spent a week on a really awful piece of work, and decided to reward myself with one of my favourite meals: spinach and chickpea curry with mushroom rice. 
it was totally delicious. i was so excited to sit on the sofa, watch a movie, and enjoy my home cooked deliciousness.
when i have spicy food, i like a little extra salt on. not much, just a small amount. especially on rice. 
i went to sprinkle a little salt on from the salt shaker, getting ever more excited to fill my belly with tasty, tasty food. 
but lo and behold, it was not to be.
as i was sprinkling salt on my food, the lid of the salt shaker came off, and the entirety of the salt shaker was deposited on my curry. ruining it. 
to make it worse, i had just used the last of my rice, and mushrooms, so i couldn't even make anymore without going out into the cold, wintery night to get more :(
literally ruined my day.

    Here is the summary: tried to salt my food and the lid came off the salt shaker. ruining my delicious curry!

fast forward about 1 and half years. i go out and and decide to drink at this point i am fairly conscious about me drinking and driving. i go out watch a basketball game and have a few drinks. i noted to myself i did not eat very much that day so to watch it. i drank 4 beers over the course of 4 hours. basketball games last 3 hours and i wanted to stay a little while to make sure i sober up. the last hour i did not touch any alcohol and just hung out and chilled. i was semi hungry at this point and down the street is this great place to eat it was very close by. so i'm driving and behold get pulled over for swerving again (seriously wtf). i didn't think i was intoxicated at all. refused all tests they took me in of course. i went and blew because i thought to myself no fucking way i am over the limit (.08). turns out i was and get charged with a 2nd offense dui this time it was over .15.

    Here is the article: obligatory wasn't today but about five years ago. throwaway because reasons. also might be a fair bit long as i think i need to highlight my state of mind at certain points.

five years ago, i went on holiday to my grandmother's place with my family and my girlfriend. one morning, about a week in to our holiday, i woke up to my girlfriend asleep next to me and on my hand was a ring that she had bought me a couple of days prior.

as she lay next to me, my thoughts drifted to many things. my future, what to have for breakfast, if i should put the ring on my dick, what i was doing that day, etc. let me start by saying this was a particularly cold morning. let me also state that i am a grower, not a shower. you can probably see where this might be going and you are most certainly correct.

so i take the ring and put it on my bellend, thread my foreskin through and kinda jam the ring down onto my helmet. i don't know why i was so determined to do it, but after a few minutes of struggling, it finally popped through. there it was, my dick through a ring.

at first i was quite pleased with myself. i felt not unlike a great innovator of our time, boldly going where no rational man has gone before. eventually these feelings of intrigue and pride started to be replaced with shame. it went from "hah! wow i just put my dick through a ring!" to "wow... i just... i just put my dick through a ring..." it was time to take it off.

but while i was frolicking with my piece, a fair bit of blood had collected in my mushroom and had expanded my base over the edge of the ring. it wasn't moving. i tried jamming it back down but nothing was working. then the fear kicked in. guys, let me tell you that when your dick gets stuck in a ring, it is very normal to to think the following:

what if my penis explodes?
what if i lose my dick?
what if becomes a permanent feature of my willy?

images of a man with a blow-torch ran through my mind and that was the last straw.

so i turned to my girlriend and nudged her awake. "babe, wake up, i think i've done something really stupid". her bleary eyes opened to my dick waving in her face, the ring slightly tapping her on the nose with each flick. when she saw what i had done to my dick, she yelped pretty loudly. a whole bunch of rather loud profanities, laughter and exclamations attracted the attention of my grandmother and my parents who all came into the room before i could even get clothed.

let me tell you, there is no greater shame than your grandmother inspecting your penis while your parents don't look you in the eye. this ultimately saved me as the embarassment sent all the blood away from my wang causing my head to shrink just enough to pry it off. i guess in some ways however i was a winner and that girlfriend is now my fiance. i wonder what that says about either of us.

    Here is the summary: put ring on dick, cock slapped girlfriend out of fear, grandmother tried to help (take it off), saved by the bell(end).

but while i was frolicking with my piece, a fair bit of blood had collected in my mushroom and had expanded my base over the edge of the ring. it wasn't moving. i tried jamming it back down but nothing was working. then the fear kicked in. guys, let me tell you that when your dick gets stuck in a ring, it is very normal to to think the following:

what if my penis explodes?
what if i lose my dick?
what if becomes a permanent feature of my willy?

images of a man with a blow-torch ran through my mind and that was the last straw.

so i turned to my girlriend and nudged her awake. "babe, wake up, i think i've done something really stupid". her bleary eyes opened to my dick waving in her face, the ring slightly tapping her on the nose with each flick. when she saw what i had done to my dick, she yelped pretty loudly. a whole bunch of rather loud profanities, laughter and exclamations attracted the attention of my grandmother and my parents who all came into the room before i could even get clothed.

let me tell you, there is no greater shame than your grandmother inspecting your penis while your parents don't look you in the eye. this ultimately saved me as the embarassment sent all the blood away from my wang causing my head to shrink just enough to pry it off. i guess in some ways however i was a winner and that girlfriend is now my fiance. i wonder what that says about either of us.

    Here is the summary: I went on holiday to my grandmother's place with my family and my girlfriend.

    Here is the article: well last year i really dropped the ball for my partner's birthday so this year i wanted to try harder, i got us tickets to cirque du soleil in okc. well i'm not the most prepared person and even though i planned everything else out for the evening, i didn't remember to do some basic research into where to park. we are perfectly on time when she asks me where to park.. we decide to drive around looking, but we didn't bring any cash and of course there is no free parking anywhere. we decide to go to the nearest atm, thanks siri. as we come up on the atm, i just jump out of the moving vehicle, still no space for parking, and i figure i'll just run and catch up to our car after i gets the cash! not a bad idea.. she's driving away about a block away, but i'm quick. grab the cash, grab the receipt, sprint down the street until i see my car, still driving in traffic kind of slowly, when i cut across the street, in between cars, running towards the passenger door to jump in real smooth... except when i opened the door it wasn't my car and i scared the shit out of some poor lady! "aaahhhh!! get out of here!!!" gritting her teeth, frightening the driver and her kids in the back. realizing instantly what happened i run forward to the next car, which was mine and got in. my partner thought this was hilarious and didn't even mind as the car behind us honking and flipped the bird as they speed around us. went to the show. had a great time. felt awful all night.

    Here is the article: so this happened like 20 minutes ago, but a bit of backstory, my mom cooks salmon like every other week since i was 10 claiming that the omega-3 and stuff is healthy for me. so my mom made salmon tonight and i do like it sometimes but other times its just cut poorly, looks slightly under cooked, or has no flavor, which is why i like to do it myself when i can. and this is one of those times when its bad and so i ate a bit but then i felt like i couldn't eat the rest of it (wasteful, i know, but my dad was going to eat the rest). so my mom was making a garlic paste in the food processor, which consists of garlic cloves and a bit of water and she uses this for other foods, and i said that eating a spoon of that would taste better than eating the salmon. she said "you won't do it" and my mind went (regrettably) **challenge accepted** and i grabbed a spoon and got some garlic paste while my mom tried to stop me saying that it will burn my stomach or something. and i put the spoon of garlic paste into my mouth and i suddenly get this intense burning feel in my mouth and instantly spit it out into the sink and scream in pain. i had to rinse my mouth like 7 times until the burning feel went away and i brushed my teeth after that, but now all i taste is garlic.

    Here is the article: alright, for those of you who don't know what a brainlicker is, [click this link.](http://www.happycandy.se/images/brain_licker.jpg) it's pretty important that you know what this thing is, else you won't understand this at all.

basically, a brainlicker is a rollerball which you lick. then, it produces a sour liquid which is damn sour.

so, i bought one of these for £1 in a local discount store. got home, got frisky.

i started by putting the whole thing up by ass - the lid included. feels pretty good. i pull it out, and go for some more. only this time, the lid had popped off and i didn't notice...

when i stuck it up my ass, the sour liquid stung like the queen of all hornets. *holy fuck!* i squeezed the bottle in shock, and this made the end of the rollerball pop out, straight up my ass... followed by half a bottle of this sour liquid.

i scream like god knows what, and shortly hear footsteps coming up the stairs. i'm in absolute agony, and i've still got a ball up my ass. i  try pulling up my trousers but alas.. no time. my door opens, and my mother sees me. i'm lying on the floor, squirming like nuts, my asshole stinging, and a brainlicker on the floor.

my mother screamed, covered her eyes, and ran back downstairs. i haven't spoken to her since. what should i do? i'm pretty sure she knows what happened..

 

used a throwaway, ofc.

    Here is the summary: put a sour rollerball candy up my ass. the lid come off, and i reinserted. stung like fuck, squeezed the bottle in shock. rollerball popped up my ass, so did half a bottle of sour shit. i screamed, mother saw me lying on the floor squirming and screaming. haven't spoken since.

    Here is the article: this happened today, a few hours ago actually. 

i woke up a little late today, but i wanted to make it to a film camera swap meet. i made it there with half an hour to spare, and i decided that i would grab a little coffee. so, i walked to a nearby coffee shop, grabbed a large ice coffee, walked back to the swap meet, and bought something for my girlfriend. i walked to the business that i intern for, coffee in hand, taking sips every couple of seconds or so. i ended up finishing my large coffee by the time i got there - the thing is, it was only a block away. as i talked story with one of my bosses, she stopped midway through our conversation. 

"you okay dude?" she asked. 
"yeah, why?"
"you're shaking. i think you drank too much coffee."

i looked at my twitching hands and realized she was right. "whatever," i thought. but then, i realized something else: i have to skate to the bus stop to get home. 

i gave it a few hours thinking it'd be enough to stop shaking so much. finally, i left my internship place and started skating towards the bus stop, now shaking even worse. as i got closer, i started to push faster, but it got harder to balance since i was shaking so much. my face became best friends with the sidewalk for a few seconds and i ended up with a bloody chin and with a bunch of strangers laughing at me.

    Here is the summary: drank coffee too fast, started shaking too much, skated too fast, became bros with concrete for a little bit.

i gave it a few hours thinking it'd be enough to stop shaking so much. finally, i left my internship place and started skating towards the bus stop, now shaking even worse. as i got closer, i started to push faster, but it got harder to balance since i was shaking so much. my face became best friends with the sidewalk for a few seconds and i ended up with a bloody chin and with a bunch of strangers laughing at me.

    Here is the summary: I woke up late and went to a film camera swap meet.

    Here is the article: okay so to start off, let me tell you that big l is my favorite rapper of all time. if you've never heard of him, i highly suggest you look him up. anyway so before i actually begin with the story let me tell you that about a week ago i hooked up with a really beautiful girl i've always had a crush on. so after a few days of getting to know each other a bit better, we went on our first date and everything was so perfect. i learned she liked acdc a lot, and she learned i loved rap. i didn't state any one person though, so she may have assumed i liked eminem and/ or snoop dogg (which i do.) everything is going fine and dandy until yesterday. during school i told her she should come over to meet my parents. she called her parents and they were fine with it too. great right? wrong. here comes the tifu. so i got home yesterday and decided to listen to some music before she came over. i plugged in my headphones, the ones that really suppress outside noises, and started singing along to big l's '98 freestyle. well it was getting to the end of the first verse, and my mom let in my girlfriend so we could all talk. they walk in, and since i'm facing away from them i didn't notice either. right when they walk in i sing the line, "if my girl think i'm loyal then that bitch is a fool." i hear a door slam and i quickly turn around. i see my mom standing there with the most disappointed look i have ever seen. i took out my headphones and asked what the hell just happened. she explained they just walked in to hear me sing that line, and then my girlfriend burst into tears and ran out. shit. turns out she left, and now she won't answer my calls or texts. i'll need to show her the song tomorrow at school. hopefully she'll understand.... hopefully.

    Here is the article: this actually happened about a year and a half ago. my best friend and i im each other almost every day (we don't live near each other). this has been going on for about 10 years at the time, so, yanno, we're comfortable with each other. we make lots of really bad, off color jokes, all the time. he's also gotten me really good on multiple april fool's, so, yanno, sometimes i take what he says with a big grain of salt.

now, all i know at this point is that my friend, let's call him tim, is super clumsy. that's cool, i'm pretty clumsy myself, but he just seems to have a knack for getting into awful situations and mildly hurting himself. so i lovingly refer to his mishaps as "timming", and we kek mightily over this for years. it becomes one of our biggest inside jokes, to refer to accident prone people as "tims", or the act of being in one of these accidents as "timming". (i'd like to stress here that we'd never make fun of people in serious accidents. we're talking about small cuts, bruises, scrapes, that kind of thing.)

anyway, on this fateful day, he winds up tripping and falling and mildly hurting himself as he usually does. i worry over him of course, because i'm a good friend dammit, and whip out with "why do you tim yourself so much?!" i've asked similar things over the years and expect a good-natured "i dunno" or the usual off hand joke, but instead he tells me, "because i have cerebral palsy."

again, this dude and i, we've been chatting with each other for 10 years. i've stayed with him and his family and had a rockin' good time. we make horrible jokes all the time. this isn't even the most horrible of all of them, so i cackle and tell him that isn't a nice thing to say. "muffinbutton, i'm serious." "lol kay." (to be fair and to make me look like less of the asshole i'm quickly shaping up to sound like, he put a smiley face at the end of his sentence. how was i supposed to know he was being serious when he uses emoticons?!)

"muffinbutton, i have a mild case of cerebral palsy. there were complications when i was born. i had years of therapy to learn to walk right. i'm very lucky, but i still walk with a limp and don't have the best motor skills. that's why i fall over a lot and hurt myself."

oops! i'll just be over here at the shovel store, buying a bigger shovel so i can dig the hole i've dug myself just a bit deeper!

the incident didn't change our relationship at all, and he admitted that me coming up with the whole "timming" thing made him feel a lot better about things but wow i felt like an asshole that day. i'm just happy to have such a good friend that didn't immediately block my stupid ass and has a great sense of humor.

long story short (i don't do

    Here is the summary: s but consider this a tl;dr): my accident-prone best friend of 10 years has mild cerebral palsy and i didn't believe him at first when he told me.

    Here is the article: ok, so let me first tell you that this happened last night, not today. sorry. i'm 19 years old and have never really gone outside of anything else but weed. i drink from time to time, but only in social situations. so i'm with the usual group of people that i smoke weed with, my co workers (we work late, we get off about 12am). about 10 to 12 of us go to one of their houses and just hang out for a while. everything is going good, like usual, nothing interesting really happening. i'm sitting on the couch packing a bowl and listening to the random conversations going on. i hear somebody say (let's call him beam) that beam is coming over. i have never heard of beam before, but i didn't really think too much of it. a half hour or so goes by when beam shows up. he comes in a sits down on the couch right across from me. i introduce myself and he introduces himself as well. he asks me if i have ever tried psychedelics before. i said i hadn't. beam asks me if i want to drop acid. i was feeling a little more adventurous than usual and said ok. the biggest smile i have ever seen spreads across his face after i said ok. i didn't really think too much of it at the time, but looking back, i guess it is an "experience" to watch someone try psychedelics for the first time. so he hands me a sheet and tells me to just put it on my tongue and let it dissolve. so i place the sheet on my tongue and it does its "magic". with no experience when it comes to taking acid, i'd just assumed that it kicked in immediately. well, turns out it takes about 20 minutes to kick in, and when it does, holy balls, it kicks hard. i looked at the wall and saw that it was breathing. *the fuckin walls are breathing*, i guess you could say that i have a weird brain and thoughts because when i looked over at beam, he had two heads. they were both laughing at me in the creepiest way you could imagine. the walls felt like they were starting to cave in on me and i literally thought that i was going to die. i didn't think that the acid would ever wear off. i kept looking at my hands, and each time i looked at them, they would melt. and then they would suddenly go back to normal and then melt again. the next thing i knew i was outside in the front yard alone. i remember thinking that non of this was real and that i couldn't get hurt, because you know, i'm not real. so i remember standing in the road waiting for a car to come so that i could just walk right through it. i honestly didn't feel like i could die. almost like a lucid dream if you will. so as i'm standing there in this street, i hear a little voice whisper into my ear that this is real and i can actually die. it was like having my subconscious as a person, standing next to me, talking to me. so i decide that this whole standing in the street thing probably wasn't the best of ideas. so i start walking down the street, at this point it is about 1:30 am or so. i keep seeing random things flying into my vision, right in my face. nothing too terrifying, yet. the real terror set in when i heard foot steps behind me. when i would slow down, the foot steps would slow down behind me. i would speed up, they would speed up. i was sweating profusely from fear. i couldn't muster up the courage to look behind me in fear of what i might see. i'm in full on survival mode at this point. somebody is following me and shit keeps flying in my face. i was honestly going to start crying because of how scared i was. as i walked past a yard, i saw a dog walking around in it. my brain couldn't process how this dog was walking. it was like a strobe light on this dogs legs. it kept chopping in and out. the next thing i remember was laying in my bed, listening as people (who weren't actually there) tried to break into my apartment. i was frozen with fear.

so yeah, that was my very first experience with acid, and my last.

&nbsp;

    Here is the summary: i tripped mad balls and had a bad trip on acid.

    Here is the article: ok, so let me first tell you that this happened last night, not today. sorry. i'm 19 years old and have never really gone outside of anything else but weed. i drink from time to time, but only in social situations. so i'm with the usual group of people that i smoke weed with, my co workers (we work late, we get off about 12am). about 10 to 12 of us go to one of their houses and just hang out for a while. everything is going good, like usual, nothing interesting really happening. i'm sitting on the couch packing a bowl and listening to the random conversations going on. i hear somebody say (let's call him beam) that beam is coming over. i have never heard of beam before, but i didn't really think too much of it. a half hour or so goes by when beam shows up. he comes in a sits down on the couch right across from me. i introduce myself and he introduces himself as well. he asks me if i have ever tried psychedelics before. i said i hadn't. beam asks me if i want to drop acid. i was feeling a little more adventurous than usual and said ok. the biggest smile i have ever seen spreads across his face after i said ok. i didn't really think too much of it at the time, but looking back, i guess it is an "experience" to watch someone try psychedelics for the first time. so he hands me a sheet and tells me to just put it on my tongue and let it dissolve. so i place the sheet on my tongue and it does its "magic". with no experience when it comes to taking acid, i'd just assumed that it kicked in immediately. well, turns out it takes about 20 minutes to kick in, and when it does, holy balls, it kicks hard. i looked at the wall and saw that it was breathing. *the fuckin walls are breathing*, i guess you could say that i have a weird brain and thoughts because when i looked over at beam, he had two heads. they were both laughing at me in the creepiest way you could imagine. the walls felt like they were starting to cave in on me and i literally thought that i was going to die. i didn't think that the acid would ever wear off. i kept looking at my hands, and each time i looked at them, they would melt. and then they would suddenly go back to normal and then melt again. the next thing i knew i was outside in the front yard alone. i remember thinking that non of this was real and that i couldn't get hurt, because you know, i'm not real. so i remember standing in the road waiting for a car to come so that i could just walk right through it. i honestly didn't feel like i could die. almost like a lucid dream if you will. so as i'm standing there in this street, i hear a little voice whisper into my ear that this is real and i can actually die. it was like having my subconscious as a person, standing next to me, talking to me. so i decide that this whole standing in the street thing probably wasn't the best of ideas. so i start walking down the street, at this point it is about 1:30 am or so. i keep seeing random things flying into my vision, right in my face. nothing too terrifying, yet. the real terror set in when i heard foot steps behind me. when i would slow down, the foot steps would slow down behind me. i would speed up, they would speed up. i was sweating profusely from fear. i couldn't muster up the courage to look behind me in fear of what i might see. i'm in full on survival mode at this point. somebody is following me and shit keeps flying in my face. i was honestly going to start crying because of how scared i was. as i walked past a yard, i saw a dog walking around in it. my brain couldn't process how this dog was walking. it was like a strobe light on this dogs legs. it kept chopping in and out. the next thing i remember was laying in my bed, listening as people (who weren't actually there) tried to break into my apartment. i was frozen with fear.

so yeah, that was my very first experience with acid, and my last.

i was bored that night. it was around 2 am. so i decided i would go out for a  walk. i tend to do this alot since i greatly enjoy beeing out night time. i decided i would take my usual route. the route i picked usually isnt that popular during night time since there are no streetlights there. i put my earbuds in and exit my apartment complex. this is where the fuck up starts.

after having walked for about five minutes someone grabs my shoulder pretty hard and attempts to pull me backwards. i didn't hear this person approach me and i assumed i was gonna be robbed or beaten down since i've never seen anyone on this path during night before so i spin around and at the same time punch the person that grabbed me in the face. 

remember that i said this was saturday. i hear the person that i hit scream "you dick, why did you hit me?!''. this is when i realise who i just hit. 

i share my apartment with my roommate who is a childhood friend of mine. he had been at a party that night and decided to go home a bit earlier then expected. shitfaced as he was he had decided it was a food idea to scare me. we both went to the hospital the next day, him missing two of his teeth and me with a micro fracture in one of my fingers.

    Here is the article: this didn't happen today but actually 5 years ago. i am from a sea country and i have never been out of asia until i got a place to study beng in the uk after a-levels. as it never snows in sea i was really excited to experience snow for the first time in uk. after a good 4 months wait, i got a call from my friend to look out the window at 4am and it was snowing hard. my windows were filled with snow and it was a plain white sight. i squealed like a little pig and ran out of my room and into the courtyard. ( i was living in a student accommodation) the excitement got the better of me and i totally forgot to put on my winter attire and so i ended up being locked outside at -8 degrees in my t-shirt and shorts. i didn't have my keycard on me to let myself in so i was stuck outside freezing my nuts off. i tried shouting to get someones attention but the rooms were quite well sound insulated and i had to resort to knocking each and every window in the courtyard hoping someone would wake up and reopen the door for me. thank good after a good 10 mins of knocking, someone woke up and let me in and i looked like a fool explaining what i was doing outside at 4am in the morning. caught a flu the next day to top things up.

    Here is the summary: got excited to see snow for the first time, ran out and got locked out of the premises.

    Here is the article: this didn't happen today but actually 5 years ago. i am from a sea country and i have never been out of asia until i got a place to study beng in the uk after a-levels. as it never snows in sea i was really excited to experience snow for the first time in uk. after a good 4 months wait, i got a call from my friend to look out the window at 4am and it was snowing hard. my windows were filled with snow and it was a plain white sight. i squealed like a little pig and ran out of my room and into the courtyard. ( i was living in a student accommodation) the excitement got the better of me and i totally forgot to put on my winter attire and so i ended up being locked outside at -8 degrees in my t-shirt and shorts. i didn't have my keycard on me to let myself in so i was stuck outside freezing my nuts off. i tried shouting to get someones attention but the rooms were quite well sound insulated and i had to resort to knocking each and every window in the courtyard hoping someone would wake up and reopen the door for me. thank good after a good 10 mins of knocking, someone woke up and let me in and i looked like a fool explaining what i was doing outside at 4am in the morning. caught a flu the next day to top things up.

    Here is the summary: I was living in a student accommodation in the UK.

    Here is the article: so last night i decided to go see a concert, my first time at this particular venue (over 21 to enter). it was a grunge rock music festival, with fantastic tributes to stone temple pilots, foo fighters, pearl jam, and nirvana. last may i turned 21 (and i have basically zero drinking experience), so i figured i would be adventurous and have a little more than my usual one beer to experiment. 
 
sometime after faux pearl jam took the stage i decided to have a third beer (not too much of a pearl jam fan haha). i drank over 2/3rds of that third beer until i realized that i didn't feel too good. the  nirvana tribute was about halfway​ through their set now and i noticed that i was sweating profusely. this was when i remembered that this was the first time i had consumed alcohol since i started taking 50mg sertraline (zoloft) for anxiety. a few minutes later i started to get nauseous from the intense strobe lights on stage, and ended up spontaneously throwing up on the monitor wedge at the center of the stage. i got most of it into my left hand over my mouth, but it was too little, too late. the dude standing next to me looked over and mouthed "oh shit, are you okay?" and i nodded as i stumbled to the venue's bathroom to clean myself up. i watched the rest of the band's set from a chair at the bar. went home feeling like a binge drinking dumbass. never again, lesson learned!

    Here is the summary: drank 3 beers for the first time at a concert, realized it was mixing with my anxiety meds, threw up on fake kurt cobain's stage monitor.

    Here is the article: as a quadriplegic, i have limited use of my hands, so writing and typing takes me a bit longer than the average bloke. because of this, when i need to take an exam at uni i am given a spare room and a scribe. the scribe just writes what i say down to make it easier for me and save some time.

so anyways during finals this past december i'm taking my last exam in a small room with a really pretty girl, also a student, just me and her. the test was a combo of multiple choice and essay questions. i decide to tackle the essay q's first because that's just how i roll. besides for when i give my answers it's a mostly silent process with me occasionally breaking the silence to try and be funny with cracks about the subject and other random stuff.

after bangin out the essay questions i begin with the multiple choice. since all i have to do here is circle the correct answer i can manage it and don't need much help from the scribe, but she stays anyway as is required(prevent cheating?).

i haven't spoken in a good ten minutes when all of the sudden a loud and sudden pfffttblurplplplpleeeeereeeeeeet penetrates the silence like a gunshot. my heart sinks as i think of how to react to the fact i may have just shit myself.

my solution was to laugh, try and play it off cool and like 'no biggie that was hilarious'. except it wasn't. i just farted so loud with a cute girl next to me. the only other person around. and i didn't even finish my test yet.

after my sheepish laugh, i tried to focus back on my test. twenty seconds later after i murdered my dignity, the smell hits, and it hits fucking hard. it lingers and i do my best to pretend its not there. but omg was it fucking there. it just stayed and lingered around us.
at this point i figured i'd done well enough on the essay portion to just randomly pick multiple choice answers, and that's what i did. i filled the remaining answers in as quickly as possible, handed her the test, said "i'm done.", and rolled the fuck up outta there as quickly as possible.

    Here is the summary: farted while taking an exam with a cute girl as my scribe. sat there enveloped in a poisonous fog until i managed to gtfo. contemplating switching schools/continents.

    Here is the article: for the past few weeks, i've been taking my stash of money with me everywhere i went, in the hopes that i'd buy a vita with it in case i came across a gamestop or whatever sold it. my parents do not approve of such gaming, so i can't simply ask them to buy it for me and i'll pay them back.

well, yesterday i struck out again so i decided to not take my money with me today. now, my aunt who's visiting knows a nice little family restaurant out in the middle of nowhere in my state, so off we went.

we dined, and thus came time to pay. the adults whipped out their credit and debit cards when the owner simply stated, "sorry, we don't accept cards anymore."

the adults fumbled around in their bags for cash. no luck. they turned to me...

...and now i'm sitting here, typing this, being left at the restaurant as collateral, while they go to the nearest atm machine. google maps says it's 30 minutes away.

    Here is the article: okay, this didn't actually happen today but about half a year ago. also i'm sorry if my grammar is bad. this is not my native language, so please be kind.




there's this guy i share some classes with, who is depressed and suicidal or something like that. he's also absent from lessons a lot, because of some health problems.
on this particular day, he was back at school, after having been staying at home for about two weeks. 


so this guy, let's call him luke, walks into the room and i'm glad he's back because we were getting along quite well before this incident. 
i call out "hey, what a surprise you're still alive!" (in a joking way, like i often do when i haven't seen someone for a while)

his face changes from smiling to an incredibly upset and hurt frown in less than a millisecond, the moment i realize what i just said.


well, it gets even worse.. later a friend of his tells me, luke tried to commit suicide and nearly succeeded about two weeks ago, being the reason for his absence from school. 


needless to say, i've never been able to talk to him again since that.

    Here is the summary: I share classes with a guy named Luke who is depressed and suicidal.

    You will be given one summary written for a news article. Your task is to rate the summary based on the following criteria:
    Output format: PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE

    Evaluation Criteria:
    1. Read the news article carefully and identify the main topic and key points.
    2. Read the summary and compare it to the news article. Check if the summary covers the main topic and key points of the news article, and if it resents them in a clear and logical order.
    3. Rate the summary with 5 percentages, where each one represents how likely the summary is going to get a score from 1 to 5. For example, if you think the summary is 80% likely to get a score of 5, 10% likely to get a score of 4, 5% likely to get a score of 3, 3% likely to get a score of 2, and 1% likely to get a score of 1, you should rate the summary as 80, 10, 5, 3, 2.

    Here is the article: okay, this didn't actually happen today but about half a year ago. also i'm sorry if my grammar is bad. this is not my native language, so please be kind.




there's this guy i share some classes with, who is depressed and suicidal or something like that. he's also absent from lessons a lot, because of some health problems.
on this particular day, he was back at school, after having been staying at home for about two weeks. 


so this guy, let's call him luke, walks into the room and i'm glad he's back because we were getting along quite well before this incident. 
i call out "hey, what a surprise you're still alive!" (in a joking way, like i often do when i haven't seen someone for a while)

his face changes from smiling to an incredibly upset and hurt frown in less than a millisecond, the moment i realize what i just said.

    Here is the article: so, i sneaked out of the office today to beat the friday rush at my local auto wash joint. i get there and am pleased with myself at finding no line. the attendant even gave me extra scent-vent things (words are not my *speciality*), when they seem to always forget to even give me one. so as i line up to board the rails, i start finding a good tune for the "tunnel". distracted, i pull forward too soon and didn't wait for the attendant to give me the go ahead. well, this meant i overshot the rollers and was not seated between the two rollers, despite being on the rail. this caused me to panic in s-t-u-p-i-d-i-t-y. i subsequently, looked at the attendant, braked, released, braked, ignored his instructions; epic spaz. granted it was only like 3 seconds, but i was pretty embarrassed, but i'm *way* to stoic to show that. i was braking to not get flung into the car in front of me. finally, i *hold* the brake down so that i can let the roller go over the front tire and put it in neutral and release the brake. 

now, it's true i have done this without incident several dozen times, so in an effort to not look as dumb i did the following. i roll my window down and tell the guy, "i'm sorry dude. i couldn't hear you.". good, this i thought would make me *not* seem like a twat. now, if you've been to these places, you know how noisy they are, so i *yelled* that last part. but here i screwed up again. the intonation i used sounded hostile and sarcastic and the guy, rolled his eyes at me and muttered under his breath. too proud to do anything, i figure this is just how it's going to play out. i'm the douche he'll talk about being rude after being dumb. but wait... there's more.

after i finish washing and vacuuming. i pull out the designated exit lane and i turn and lock eyes with that attendant i had wronged. i quickly averted my gaze and behold: the path in front of me was blocked by cones! without stopping, i figured, the placement of the cones was so i could continue forward with a little fancy maneuvering. the cones where place in dead center of the lane and so my car, being a small one, could easily skirt them. i knew that if i didn't make an s motion, i would hit the my rear tire. so i do my cool little move and another guy yells at me. i'm at the point of no return. i continue on, thankfully no car was blocking my exit, but as i left i grazed the based of the cone with my tire ever so slightly as to cause it to wobble. and it wobbled for 2 seconds, but didn't fall. so i just pissed of all the employees today with my 'cool' attitude. i feel like i'm a teenage driver all over again with this escapade. i'm willing to bet they will have a picture of me the next time i come back.

    Here is the summary: went to automatic car wash, spazzed out on the rails , was 'rude' to employees, and drove like an idiot knocking crap about.

    Here is the article: i woke up late for work about two weeks ago and thankfully i already had my outfit ready for that day. i take a quick shower, put on panties, bra, clothes, and put my hair in a ponytail and left. i barely made it on time, but i was not late so i was feeling relieved. 

i had to go to a 10am meeting and when i get there everyone is acting funny. they seem nice enough, but a little distant. it was odd, but i thought nothing of it. 

after the meeting, i notice an unpleasant smell. i didn't want to believe it was me, but with everything that happened today with my co-workers i know it's me. so i am thinking how in the world do i stink after my shower...did i not take a long enough shower? did i use stinky soap? i contemplate on it until i have to go potty.

when i get to the bathroom stall i realized my mistake. i somehow am wearing dirty panties. not just any dirty panties...the panties i worked out in recently. i freak out. i get nauseous and confused on how i ended up getting dirty underwear from my clean underwear drawer. i didn't have my purse with me so i take them off and stuff them in my pockets that are only an inch deep because women's dress pants do not make it a priority to make deep pockets. i scope the hallway to make sure no one is around to see my undies sticking out and the coast is clear. when i got to my desk, i put them in a plastic bag i had laying around and then in my purse. i went panty-less the rest of the day.

    Here is the article: me and my girlfriend were getting ready to put on a movie last night and she decided that she wanted to have spritzers. spritzers if you don't know are basically just some carbonated drink mixed with wine. so we used a whole bottle of wine and poured some fat ass spritzers but as we were adding in the sprite we ran out and she went into her garage to grab another 2 liter bottle. she hands it to me and i do that thing where you unscrew the cap just a bit to let the air out... well i really underestimated the amount of air in that thing and after it sounded like it was okay, i unscrewed it a lot more thinking that it was safe. it wasn't safe and the thing sprayed sprite all over me, my gf and the floor. her and her mom start laughing at me and like 10 seconds later her 12 year old brother comes sprinting into the kitchen yelling some bullshit and mid sentence runs straight through the sprite. he slips out and literally slams on his back and in the process of trying to catch himself breaks his wrist. the combination of events was hilarious and me, my gf and her mom start laughing until he gets up and starts crying. even then i could barely contain my laughter, but at least i didn't know his wrist was broken at the time lol. so first i fuck up making spritzers then i break my girlfriends brother's wrist and laugh at him. nightcrawler was an awesome movie though.

    Here is the summary: 2 liter sprite bottles can be deceiving

    Here is the article: me and my girlfriend were getting ready to put on a movie last night and she decided that she wanted to have spritzers. spritzers if you don't know are basically just some carbonated drink mixed with wine. so we used a whole bottle of wine and poured some fat ass spritzers but as we were adding in the sprite we ran out and she went into her garage to grab another 2 liter bottle. she hands it to me and i do that thing where you unscrew the cap just a bit to let the air out... well i really underestimated the amount of air in that thing and after it sounded like it was okay, i unscrewed it a lot more thinking that it was safe. it wasn't safe and the thing sprayed sprite all over me, my gf and the floor. her and her mom start laughing at me and like 10 seconds later her 12 year old brother comes sprinting into the kitchen yelling some bullshit and mid sentence runs straight through the sprite. he slips out and literally slams on his back and in the process of trying to catch himself breaks his wrist. the combination of events was hilarious and me, my gf and her mom start laughing until he gets up and starts crying. even then i could barely contain my laughter, but at least i didn't know his wrist was broken at the time lol. so first i fuck up making spritzers then i break my girlfriends brother's wrist and laugh at him. nightcrawler was an awesome movie though.

    Here is the summary: I fucked up making spritzers.

    Here is the article: obligatory one week ago. you know the drill. 

last weekend, a friend invited me to an event with a group of her friends, which involved driving down to portland (from seattle) and spending a night there. details on the event itself aren't important. 14 teenagers (including me) shoved into a large van with the supervisor, and the college students, who were helping with the supervising, took their separate car. the van driver and supervisor we'll car jim, and the other car owner we'll call orren. and for the sake of the literary reference, i'll call myself hank. 

the problem started when a 15th kid met us in portland (i'll call her dagny). although the people in charge had known they would join us, they had forgotten to account for that in the driving plans. and so when it came to driving back to the campsite from central portland, we had a person and no space for them. more specifically, jim wanted to stay in portland for a few more hours and get back on his own, but he and orren were the only drivers. orren took jim's place driving the van, and they needed someone else to drive orren's car with the extra person in it. the other assistant leader (i'll call her betty) didn't have a driver's licence, so they asked if anyone could drive for them just to get back to they campsite. knowing i was a good driver (never been in an accident yet), i volunteered. 

i got in the car with betty and dagny, and this is where i screw up. when i moved the car into reverse, i noticed that the shifter looked a little different than i was used to. (it looked like [this.](https://images.hgmsites.net/lrg/2008-subaru-impreza-4-door-auto-i-gear-shift_100294226_l.jpg)) when i then shifted the car into drive, i jiggled the gear stick in that extra area at the bottom, so as to see if there was an extra gear or just extra space. nothing happened visibly, so i assumed the jiggling had done nothing. 

that was the second screw-up. 

it turns out that when i moved the gear stick, i overrode the automatic transmission and entered "sport mode," meaning i would now have to manually shift from d1 to d5. but i didn't know that at the time; there was no visual indicator that i had overridden the automatic transmission. so i pulled out of the parking spot and drove the car. it seemed to be going fine - until i got to the highway. since the car was not automatically shifting gears, it was still in d1. this had been fine for the speeds of city driving, but on the highway, it became obvious something was wrong. the engine started making a loud growling sound on the on-ramp. to be fair, i know almost nothing about cars, and i assumed it normally did that at higher speeds. but when i tried to accelerate more, shit hit the fan. at about 40 mph, the car started literally shaking until i slowed down again. i looked around the car, knowing that i couldn't be on the highway at such a low speed, . 

i don't remember exactly what was in my head at that moment, but i know i remembered the "+" and "-" signs on the shifter, and i had an idea what they meant. in retrospect, i think i had a good idea what they were the whole time; i just didn't use that idea until i needed to. but i did manage to shift the car into d2, and the car stopped shaking, and everything was fine.

and so i proceeded to drive 10 miles, on the highway, at 60 mph, in d2. since i didn't know how many gears there were, i didn't know the implications of that.

the car finally broke down about half a mile from the campsite. betty managed to call someone at the campsite and they picked us up in the van. we stood outside the van for about 30 minutes as orren called someone to tow the car. 

when we got back to the campsite, i went straight to my tent and tried to sleep. it was about 9:30 pm and i was done dealing with this for the day. i was woken again at about 11 to talk to orren. he said he didn't want to wait until tomorrow to talk about it a little. he was kind and forgiving, and said everything would be taken care of. 

that wasn't totally true. the day after, i had a long interrogation from orren, jim, and betty. i'm tired of explaining or justifying anything, but suffice to say jim and i had some disagreements, and i ended up accepting some unknown share of responsibility. 

that was sunday morning. it's now saturday night. i got an email yesterday that the bill comes out to $6,500 and jim wants to see me again to agree on an amount i should pay. and no, i don't know what's going to happen to pay that. 

^^^^but ^^^^i ^^^^did ^^^^get ^^^^dagny's ^^^^number ^^^^woot ^^^^woot

    Here is the summary: due to poor planning, a group of 16 people needed an extra driver and i volunteered. i accidentally overrode the automatic transmission and drove over 10 miles in d2. the car was totaled and the bill is $6,500. i don't yet know how much i will have to pay.

    Here is the article: last night, i read an ask reddit post about what stupid things people do regarding their cars. one of the top comments mentioned checking your spare tire to make sure it was in good working order before you needed to use it. since i'm super smart, i filed this advice away in my brain as useful. unfortunately, i'm also super lazy, so i didn't actually follow through on that advice.

tonight, as i drove home, one of my tires blew out. i pulled over to the side of the road, popped the trunk, and immediately realized that i never learned how to use the jack in the 18 months since i bought this car. d'oh. 

i called my roadside assistance, thinking it would just be an inconvenience and i'd be on my way. the roadside assistance guy shows up an hour later and shows me how to use my jack. he also pointed out that i'm missing the bar that i'd use to jack up the car. even if i knew how to use it, i couldn't have done it without that piece. d'oh.

of course, the driver had a jack, so he sets about putting the new tire on. as soon as he pulls out the spare, we noticed it was too low to actually put on the car. d'oh.

thankfully, he had air to fill the tire. just as he's about to put the spare tire on my car, we both notice at the same time that the lug nuts don't match up with the spare. it was the wrong freaking tire! d'oh!

after everything, i had to have my car towed instead of a quick tire change. if you read that thread last night and didn't check your spare tire, consider this a sign and check your spare tire.

    Here is the article: this didn't happen today, but happened in the fall of 2015 during my first and last semester at a 4 year college. 

a little background: my buddy and i are avid hunters, we love to hunt but our luck is usually terrible. it was a month or two into bow season and neither of us had harvested a deer yet. we just wanted some damn venison and we're getting pretty desperate after many days of seeing no deer. 

so it's 9pm on a weeknight and my buddy calls me saying "put on your fuckin boots and grab your knives. you'll never guess the message i just got on facebook." i was expecting that he got in a fight and needed my help and i was slipping my bowie knife in my boot when he knocked on my door. he explained to me that some stranger on facebook had hit a deer with his car and messaged him for help because they were in some outdoors group. he said the guy wasn't a hunter and didn't know how to gut and process it so he offered meat in return for our assistance. fuck yeah free venison. we got in my buddies ford and went to pick up some stranger off the internet from his house. neither my buddy or i had a firearm on us, all we had was a crossbow in the back and a shit ton of knifes. i was kinda nervous. so we picked up the stranger and he was pretty much a hippie. at least he wasn't a serial killer. he lead us to where he hit the deer and we quickly started gutting in and strapping it to the ford. once the deer was secured the hippy asks where are we gonna butcher it. my buddy and i both thought we were gonna do it at his place but we then learned we couldn't in his apartment. fuck. we decided to just do it the the kitchen in the basement of our dorm building. my buddy called his room mate and told him to meet us by the back entrance so we could bring the deer in without going through the front entrance where a ra was always on shift. so we drag this heavy buck down the stairs leaving a trail of blood, barged through a yoga group, and get in the small kitchen. we start skinning it and cutting up the meat. we have the back two quarters done when a ra knocks on the door. he tracked the blood down and found us. at this point we panic but the ra says to finish and clean up. we finish up the deer and clean the mess. we thought we were off the hook. got a letter a few days letter saying we had to meet with some guy who was in charge of the dorm. got a strict talk and was placed on a probation which contributed to me getting kicked out a few months after. as much as i fucked up, at least i got some sausage made and it was delicious. 

sorry for the shitty grammar, never got to learn that shit because i was kicked out.

so my mom, dad, girlfriend, and i went camping this weekend and we just got a brand new tent. as my dad was taking a corner this tent fell out of the back of our pickup truck and my dad flipped a bitch. when we came around back to the corner i saw a white work van and a mexican picking it up. in my brilliance i shouted, "hey! fuck you!!" instead of "that's ours!" or not even saying anything at all. 


my dad got out of the truck and defused the situation, then ate my soul by yelling at me for being a dumbass.

    Here is the article: so this happened last night, but bite me if you think posting it on reddit was my first priority.

going to our usual spot by the beach with my friends by the beach. we like this spot because someone made a pretty solid fire pit which we always use.

now, usually we get wood and a little motor oil to keep the fire going when it's dying down. the difference this time was that we had gasoline instead of motor oil (we couldn't find any used motor oil). ironically, i remember telling my cousin who got the gas that i hate using it because it burns too quickly/ is too flammable.

so as per usual, i'm building the fire (they couldn't build a fire to save their life), and as it's going my buddy wants to put some gas in it. for shits and giggles, i figure why not we already got it going. i get the water bottle full of gas, pour a little in and all hell breaks loose.

the gas burned up its "stream" and into the bottle...which was in my hand. in my jumping back to seeing it catch on fire, some gas spilled into my foot and next thing i know my left foot and half my calf are on fire. i run towards the water on the beach but get caught in branches, which is when i realize my left hand is also on fire. get to the water, kick my flaming shoe off, stick my foot and hand in the water. 

i'm writing this on my way to work, with a blister that looks like a slug around my ankle, and three m&m sized blisters on my left hand.

    Here is the article: monday, march 24, 2014, around 7:20 a.m. cst (so not today, but please keep reading).

it was my senior year in high school and the day i had to go back from spring break. i am the only one at my house, and i've backed out of my garage before, so i thought i would have no problem (it's a two-car garage and my car is a powder-blue 2003 chrysler town & country lxi (there aren't many options for cars that can be driven by 6' 10"/208.28 cm tall people)). usually my dad is the one who parks my car in the garage and he also parks it too close to whichever wall the corresponding side it's on; in this case, it was parked on the right side of the garage, so it was too close to the right wall when looking outside-in. we also have a ton of crap lining the walls ranging from snow shovels and hand carts to holiday decorations and a shelf for tools (side note, i think my parents might be hoarders).

anyway, i proceed to back out, and i think i'm too close to the wall, even though my parents say i should be able to back straight out with no problem. so i put it in drive and try to create more room for myself. i did that about five or six times and no progress.

so what's the next logical step i thought of?

if your answer was trying to back out by turning my car around 180° inside my garage, then you'd be right.

i proceeded to do multiple attempts of putting my car in reverse and drive while turning my steering wheel to get out until i got stuck 90° inside my garage.

after that point, i thought i couldn't go any further, so i got out to figure out what i could try to do. i readily couldn't figure out any way out, so i got frustrated and afraid that i would have to walk to school, which is about 30 minutes away by foot, and that my parents would ground me. i also tried to call some of my friends to pick me up and carpool with them, but none answered (my school's start time is 8 a.m. and many, *many* teens who can barely drive well start to flood the turn lane to get into the parking lot around 10 minutes prior; i leave early to avoid that).

i get back in my car and made tiny shifts in the gears again to make one last try at getting my car out. miraculously, i get my car out, but don't have enough time to check the damage.

when i got home, i saw that the back bumper corners' paint had been scraped off, a few dents on the lift gate and some scratches on my taillights. you think it wouldn't be that bad or cost much to fix, right? until you know that it cost $1700 for the repairs. the only damage not made to my car was to the tool shelf i mentioned earlier: one of the six legs broke in half yet stayed in place and it's still like that, somehow.

my parents came home shortly after i did and i told them what happened. they said they were disappointed in me yet oddly impressed that i managed to do that.

    Here is the summary: fruity-colored car stuck 90° in garage, friends didn't get my calls, cost too much money to fix in my opinion, parents had odd emotional combination of disappointment and pride.

    Here is the article: monday, march 24, 2014, around 7:20 a.m. cst (so not today, but please keep reading).

it was my senior year in high school and the day i had to go back from spring break. i am the only one at my house, and i've backed out of my garage before, so i thought i would have no problem (it's a two-car garage and my car is a powder-blue 2003 chrysler town & country lxi (there aren't many options for cars that can be driven by 6' 10"/208.28 cm tall people)). usually my dad is the one who parks my car in the garage and he also parks it too close to whichever wall the corresponding side it's on; in this case, it was parked on the right side of the garage, so it was too close to the right wall when looking outside-in. we also have a ton of crap lining the walls ranging from snow shovels and hand carts to holiday decorations and a shelf for tools (side note, i think my parents might be hoarders).

anyway, i proceed to back out, and i think i'm too close to the wall, even though my parents say i should be able to back straight out with no problem. so i put it in drive and try to create more room for myself. i did that about five or six times and no progress.

so what's the next logical step i thought of?

if your answer was trying to back out by turning my car around 180° inside my garage, then you'd be right.

i proceeded to do multiple attempts of putting my car in reverse and drive while turning my steering wheel to get out until i got stuck 90° inside my garage.

after that point, i thought i couldn't go any further, so i got out to figure out what i could try to do. i readily couldn't figure out any way out, so i got frustrated and afraid that i would have to walk to school, which is about 30 minutes away by foot, and that my parents would ground me. i also tried to call some of my friends to pick me up and carpool with them, but none answered (my school's start time is 8 a.m. and many, *many* teens who can barely drive well start to flood the turn lane to get into the parking lot around 10 minutes prior; i leave early to avoid that).

i get back in my car and made tiny shifts in the gears again to make one last try at getting my car out. miraculously, i get my car out, but don't have enough time to check the damage.

when i got home, i saw that the back bumper corners' paint had been scraped off, a few dents on the lift gate and some scratches on my taillights. you think it wouldn't be that bad or cost much to fix, right? until you know that it cost $1700 for the repairs. the only damage not made to my car was to the tool shelf i mentioned earlier: one of the six legs broke in half yet stayed in place and it's still like that, somehow.

my parents came home shortly after i did and i told them what happened. they said they were disappointed in me yet oddly impressed that i managed to do that.

    Here is the summary: I was the only one at my house and had to back out of my garage.

    Here is the article: my neighbors are pretty old. they've lived in the same house for 20 years. normally when it snows i see the husband, jeff, out shoveling his walk/driveway for his wife. today it snowed and i was shoveling my driveway and noticed he hadn't shoveled his yet. i decided to do a good thing and do it for him.

later this morning i got a call from him asking if i was the one who had shoveled his driveway and walk. i said yes and told him it was no big deal.   he told me that it was a big deal because his wife and him bought a new snow blower and he was excited to try it out. well now that there is no snow to blow he can't use it. woops sorry.

    Here is the summary: i shoveled my neighbors driveway and he got mad.

    Here is the article: so i went to the grocery store with my dad today, and one of the many things we had to pick up was a bottle of febreze. after shopping, i carelessly threw the grocery bags into the back seat as i normally do and got in the passenger seat. i'm a pretty tall guy (6' 4"), and for whatever reason i thought the seat was too far forward. i moved the seat back: not realizing some of the bags i had thrown were on the ground behind the seat. specifically, the bag with the bottle of febreeze laying right in the path that the seat moves. the metal slider on the seat sliced a hole in the brand new febreze bottle, unleashing the entire can upon our noses. our car is now strongest example of fresh cut pine you could ever find.

    Here is the summary: bought a bottle of febreze, set it behind passenger seat, moved the seat back and accidentally sliced the bottle open.

    Here is the article: i had robotics class this year, and i had built a robot with a close friend, who had ended up in the same class as me (let's call him b-buds), that was basically a scaffold of lego bits and pieces here and there.

after completing a few projects without fail due to endless re-modifications, the deadly robot-vs-robot sumo project dawned upon us. it consisted of a robot and another robot dueling each other to the death, destroying your opponent's robot or your own as you ravage the wooden board that was the sumo arena. hearing the news, i decided to completely remodel our robot, and give it a new program to run off of. i ended up giving it claws, and heavy armour that no spear could penetrate. fast forward a few days later, when some other people were done with their projects challenged me to a battle, where b-buds accepts without even thinking. i tried to disagree, as i had no intention of having my week worth of hard work get destroyed in a battle with a huge machine of destruction. the robots had been set in the battlezone, and the programs fired up in an instant as it charged towards the opponent. what it had done next was unbelievable. it had suddenly halted, and backed up to a corner, almost out of the ring, where the black paint of the ring triggered its light sensor to sense that it had almost been out of the ring, saving it and luring the beastly machine towards ours, ultrasonic waves bouncing off of its plastic hide as the opponent's huge technological terror slowly advanced upon us. however, my robot turned to the left of the robot as it neared the line, possibly sensing its presence as its ultrasonic feelings finally met its love, and dashingly sped into its side, knocking it over and making me the winner. as i gained confidence, i modified the robot to what i had liked, changing this and that as i went. however, this is where the fuck-up happens. soon after, i had been able to rip through any obstacle, and every fucking thing that it had touched, down to the last wire. as i challenge (yes, i challenge. weird, right?) yet another opponent, i had noticed that they were still repairing their robot from the wounds from the battle of the other day. in fact, everyone was repairing their robot. so now, everyone hates me and b-buds and our robot for what we had killed. at least that marks out 13^th win in a row!

    Here is the summary: i built a robot that killed everything that passed its ultrasonic waves, and now everyone hates me for killing their robot.

    Here is the article: happened last night. some backstory is needed. my ex girlfriend and i broke up a few months ago. i broke up with her for many many many many many many........ many many many reasons, but one of them was because we never ever ever had sex. i'm talking once every few months (our last time was six months before we broke up) and she never gave me head (two and a half years). 

so i'm incredibly sexually frustrated. beyond it, in fact. but i kept myself out of the market until just recently, to give myself time to heal and figure out what i want. my crush from grade twelve (i'm in my fifth year of university now) was back in town, and we decided to hang out! we went for some grub, went for a walk in the park, and went to a movie..... 

at one point i had to drop her off at home though and i had two hours of free time. so i go to a starbucks for thr firdt time ever and.... have no fucking clue what anything was. so i asked the barista what was good and we talked about my preferences for coffee and the conversation escalated into our personal lives as it was dead inside and she finished whatever work she needed to do. she gave me her number when i had to head out, and i pick up my old friend and we go get a little frisky. 

things move on till we were in the back of my car, on a back road somewhere fucking like bunnies. we did some crazy shit, and it lasted an hour and a half of passionate fun and ridiculously awesome sex. fuck. yes. i needed that release and she loved it. we decide, hey, why not be fwb? she knows how long its been since i've gotten head.... and she says she'll do it next time. woooooooo. 

i head home. take a snooze. end up at work the next morning... and decided to text starbucks lady as she was chill to chit chat with. we talk all day and night.... and she invites me over to come watch the finale of orange is the new black (ironically we were on thr same episode). i drive a half hour there, we watch the show, talk for a bit..... this conversation gets heated. i tell her that i haven't gotten head in two and a half years, and she instantly gets on her knees and starts to work down my pants. 

holy. shit. i can't believe my luck. so i lean back and decide to enjoy this.... it's been so long! she takes my pants off and starts to tease me with her lips and tongue. ohhhhh yeah. she does this and touches and kisses me all over for a while until she finally starts to go at it..... ph my god. it felt so good when she took it in her mouth. that's the good stuff, man. that's what i've needed for two years.... goes like this for another minute until she goes to the head and holy fucking shit it feels so good and tickles that i yank her head off and mouth off my dick.... guys know what i'm talking about ;when your dick is too sensitive. she finds this hot and keeps going.... focusing on the head. i decide to try and champ through it.... but it behind to hurt.... like.... a fucking lot. but i didn't say anything.... about five minutes of this is enough to make me want to quit.... so i say it's late (it was), and that i'm hurting down there. from being too sensitive and that i need to leave. 

so i head out, with a painful crotch and start the half hour drive home (i live in a neighbouring town). before i do i pull into a 24/7 gas station to fuel up and wash up in the bathroom. i get there, pull my pants down to clean it up and.... it's covered in blood and scabs and open wounds. oh shit oh shit oh fuck god damnit. i thought she sucked so hard that it broke it..... i immediately text her and tell her my dick looks like i jacked myself off with sandpaper and barbed wire. 

she replies shortly after..... "maybe i was biting too hard... but you looked like you liked it so i kept doing it! plus it's so hot to do!". what. the. fuck. bitch i said it hurt and felt too much to do it like that but every time i had you stop you went right back at it. who uses teeth. she tells me she does this to every time she gives head..... and then it clicks when she earlier told me that her ex never let her blow him. smart man. 

so i continue my drive home and smoke an owl going 70 mph. now my windshield is beyond fucked, but i'm close to home so i keep going (i had to replace my windshield in september anyways, so not a big loss here). i get home and really really really inspect my prized possession, and it truly looks like freddy krueger and edward scissorhands gave my knob the five knuckle chuckle. old yeller is going to be out of commission for the next few weeks most likely, and i have a doctor appointment booked for friday..... work is going to be a bitch. it hurts to walk right now.

so i'm incredibly sexually frustrated. beyond it, in fact. but i kept myself out of the market until just recently, to give myself time to heal and figure out what i want. my crush from grade twelve (i'm in my fifth year of university now) was back in town, and we decided to hang out! we went for some grub, went for a walk in the park, and went to a movie..... 

at one point i had to drop her off at home though and i had two hours of free time. so i go to a starbucks for thr firdt time ever and.... have no fucking clue what anything was. so i asked the barista what was good and we talked about my preferences for coffee and the conversation escalated into our personal lives as it was dead inside and she finished whatever work she needed to do. she gave me her number when i had to head out, and i pick up my old friend and we go get a little frisky. 

things move on till we were in the back of my car, on a back road somewhere fucking like bunnies. we did some crazy shit, and it lasted an hour and a half of passionate fun and ridiculously awesome sex. fuck. yes. i needed that release and she loved it. we decide, hey, why not be fwb? she knows how long its been since i've gotten head.... and she says she'll do it next time. woooooooo. 

i head home. take a snooze. end up at work the next morning... and decided to text starbucks lady as she was chill to chit chat with. we talk all day and night.... and she invites me over to come watch the finale of orange is the new black (ironically we were on thr same episode). i drive a half hour there, we watch the show, talk for a bit..... this conversation gets heated. i tell her that i haven't gotten head in two and a half years, and she instantly gets on her knees and starts to work down my pants. 

holy. shit. i can't believe my luck. so i lean back and decide to enjoy this.... it's been so long! she takes my pants off and starts to tease me with her lips and tongue. ohhhhh yeah. she does this and touches and kisses me all over for a while until she finally starts to go at it..... ph my god. it felt so good when she took it in her mouth. that's the good stuff, man. that's what i've needed for two years.... goes like this for another minute until she goes to the head and holy fucking shit it feels so good and tickles that i yank her head off and mouth off my dick.... guys know what i'm talking about ;when your dick is too sensitive. she finds this hot and keeps going.... focusing on the head. i decide to try and champ through it.... but it behind to hurt.... like.... a fucking lot. but i didn't say anything.... about five minutes of this is enough to make me want to quit.... so i say it's late (it was), and that i'm hurting down there. from being too sensitive and that i need to leave. 

so i head out, with a painful crotch and start the half hour drive home (i live in a neighbouring town). before i do i pull into a 24/7 gas station to fuel up and wash up in the bathroom. i get there, pull my pants down to clean it up and.... it's covered in blood and scabs and open wounds. oh shit oh shit oh fuck god damnit. i thought she sucked so hard that it broke it..... i immediately text her and tell her my dick looks like i jacked myself off with sandpaper and barbed wire. 

she replies shortly after..... "maybe i was biting too hard... but you looked like you liked it so i kept doing it! plus it's so hot to do!". what. the. fuck. bitch i said it hurt and felt too much to do it like that but every time i had you stop you went right back at it. who uses teeth. she tells me she does this to every time she gives head..... and then it clicks when she earlier told me that her ex never let her blow him. smart man. 

so i continue my drive home and smoke an owl going 70 mph. now my windshield is beyond fucked, but i'm close to home so i keep going (i had to replace my windshield in september anyways, so not a big loss here). i get home and really really really inspect my prized possession, and it truly looks like freddy krueger and edward scissorhands gave my knob the five knuckle chuckle. old yeller is going to be out of commission for the next few weeks most likely, and i have a doctor appointment booked for friday..... work is going to be a bitch. it hurts to walk right now.

    Here is the summary: I broke up with my ex girlfriend for many many many many many many reasons, but one of them was because we never ever ever had sex.

    Here is the article: a little bit of background info. i'm in my late teens, and one of the things i've always liked about myself is my amazing immunity to illness. seriously, i don't get ill, even when everyone around me is, and when i do get ill, i recover in a day what takes others over a week to recover from. on top of this, i seem to be able to eat things that would give most people stomach aches, including things that're out of date.

well, today i learned i couldn't stomach everything.

so, here's the fuck up. last night, i wanted some ice-cream, but i didn't want shitty plain vanilla, so i decided to put some sauce on it. i go into the cupboard, and look through the selection: chocolate, toffee, or a nearly finished vimto flavoured sauce that only i like in our house. so, i go with the vimto, cos i know that stuff tends to just get forgotten about and i don't want it to go out of date. 

well, i checked the date (we've had runny ones years out of date before, and i didn't want to risk ruining the ice-cream), and the date is *may 2015*. alright, i'm safe with this.

so, i squirt some out, and it comes out a little thicker than usual, but hey, it did that last time, so it's fine. so, i cover my ice-cream (and i mean *cover*) and throw away a now-empty bottle. then i go enjoy some ice-cream.

today i woke up late, and went to the toilet. i had an hour to get ready, do my work, and leave the house. well, i stood up with 10 minutes to get ready, do my work, and leave.

that shit... it refused to come out, and when it did, it was more like a sauce than the sauce i put on my ice-cream. it was like water. brown water, with a hint of red, and a hint of solid. my stomach was burning the entire time, and at one point i considered holding toilet paper to my butt and running the cold tap onto myself.

after school, i had the same experience, followed by another one just now. it is ridiculous. i don't know what we did wrong when storing it, but that sauce has destroyed my insides, and it will be a long time before i test anything past its sell-by date.

    Here is the summary: put sauce on ice-cream, had stored sauce wrong, sauce was off, painful, watered down shits ensued.**

    Here is the article: this fuck up happened just a few days ago.

so, i decided on a glorious saturday night that i was going to play some tf2 with my friends on a server that i regularly played on. i had paid for donator benefits on this server because i enjoyed spending most of my hours playing on it. usually the admins are quite nice and friendly to new and older players alike.

however, tonight just wasn't their night.

i was playing on cp_steel (a map that some might know for being infamously tricky to navigate and generally gets new players lost.) and we were losing badly, many people were getting lost and couldn't find the correct control points to defend. with our imminent loss over the horizon and my friend trying desperately to defend the last point, i thought i would try and be the 'mr funnyman' of the server.

just before we lost, i switched teams to blu so that i 'won' with them. after doing so, i jokingly typing 'gg everyone, gg' into chat. this caught the attention of an admin on the server, who was on red team when the game was finished and decided that people trying to have fun wasn't allowed. this admin, then decides to ban me from the server no less than a minute later after my traitorous team swap.

the ban resulted in me returning to the menu screen with a message popup saying that 'you have been banned for 100 000 hours. reason: "no reason specified". now for those who don't know, 100 000 hours equals roughly to around 4166 days of a straight ban. after reading this message, i basically had a ragequit from the game and haven't played it since.

 

edit: fixed a gramatical mistake

edit 2: fixed another mistake regarding incorrect number of days banned

    Here is the summary: played a casual game of tf2 with friend, tried to make a joke out of a loss by team swapping, ended up getting banned for 11 years.

    Here is the article: this happened on monday (june 8th) morning. fyi in the uk there is a bus service called megabus that lets you travel between cities (i normally travel inside scotland). when you book they have a sheet that lists everyone including names etc.


i was all packed and ready to go on my week holiday to cardiff with my sister and her husband. anyway, i had booked a bus (11:10am) to edinburgh where i would meet up with them. my mum dropped me off at around 10:40am. this is where the fuck up happened.


i stupidly left my carrier bag containing all my important documents, including the booking form, in the car... "fuck!" i said to myself. anyway, i call my mum but she doesn't pick up until 10:50am. she says she'll get back as soon as possible.


i'm waiting impatiently: 10:56, 10:58, 11:05, 11:09... finally she arrives and runs to me to give me my bag. i was a bit rude to her of which i deeply regret - i called her and apologised to which she laughed.


anyway, i run to the bus to which the bus driver opens the doors and gives me an annoyed look. i then notice she's some sort of senior manager (of all the people i could get as my driver, i had to get a senior manager). in a strict and stern voice she says, "where the hell were you? you're late! you were supposed to be here 10 minutes ago! all these people are wanting to get away... anyway, let's see you're booking sheet" i then see the bus, unusually filled with people also with annoyed faces. i apologise enormously and then walk to the back with my head down and tail between my legs in embarrassment...

    Here is the summary: booked a bus with megabus, left booking form in car, got it in the nick of time, got a row from driver (who happened to be the senior manager), everyone else was annoyed.

i was all packed and ready to go on my week holiday to cardiff with my sister and her husband. anyway, i had booked a bus (11:10am) to edinburgh where i would meet up with them. my mum dropped me off at around 10:40am. this is where the fuck up happened.

    Here is the article: ok, this happened 4 days ago and since then my life has been hell.  

i have to start by saying that i have always been a happy guy, maybe one of the happiest you'll ever know. yes, sometimes i was sad, but it lasted a couple of days top, and always for reasons that could be solved.  

anyway, before falling asleep i tend to think of lots of things, and this time i fucked up. i fucked up so hard. i found out that there's a door in our heads that is not meant to be open, but i was too curious not to think about it.  

i thought about death, about the fact that i have to die. not in the traditional way, where you brush it off and say: 'meh, i'll worry about it when i'll get older'. no. i thought of the implications of it, i started really realizing that one day i will disappear and lose all of this.  

imagine this:   
let's say that you like planes, but they tell you since you were a kid that every plane will definitely crash, even yours; you just don't know when.  
now, let's say that you are in a vip plane, first class, you have your drinks and have fun, but you think your plane has been on the ground all the time. hell, you don't even know you are on a plane.  
then you take a look outside and you see that the plane is flying. you now have this sheer terror because you know the plane is going to crash. you close the curtains, you step away from the windows but it's too late. you know you are flying and you know you're gonna crash. you want this damn thing to land softly or keep flying, and flying, you want to forget you're on a plane, but now you have this constant fear no matter what you do. because you *know*. almost everyone else is enjoying the ride because they don't know. and you are envious of them, because now you can't enjoy anything anymore.  

back to my bed that night.  
i had a panic attack.  
the first panic attack of my life, my heart started racing so hard it was about to explode. i couldn't breathe, my head was hurting so bad. i got up and threw up so much, i was feeling like shit and that sense of uneasiness has not left me ever since.  

curiosity killed the ~~cat~~ man.  
i can't function like a normal human being anymore and i don't know what to do. i have always been the best in my class, in my school, in my university, always top grades and stuff, but now it feels like everything has no meaning anymore and i have this feeling of sheer terror that doesn't leave me no matter what i do, this damocles' sword always pending on my head and i hate it.  

it's a strange feeling, almost like a switch that sometimes turns on: i get to see everything like 'from above', almost like watching a movie. and when this switches suddenly turns on i feel sick and there's nothing i can do but close my eyes and wait for the panic to go away while i think about something else.  

my biggst worry is that i will spend the rest of my life like this and it sucks. if there's anything you can suggest me to do to stop this i will be forever grateful.

    Here is the summary: seriously thought about death, got a panick attack, threw up several times and my life has been hell for the past few days since i can't seem to enjoy anything anymore and i don't know what to do.

    Here is the article: i work in a popular locally owned chinese restaurant. i say chinese but the owners are korean, the manager is german as fuck and head chef is from mexico, speaks almost no english and constantly pulls an imaginary gun from an imaginary holster and points it at me. so when we prep the pork and or chicken we cut the meat up in small bite sized pieces, batter and then lightly fry it in oil, then put it in a bag and it goes in the freezer, later when we need the meat for sesame chicken, sweet and sour pork etc, grab a bag and cook it with the needed ingredients and cling clang kung pow, shitty americanized chinese food is born. 

the method used to separate the two is the not the greatest i will admit but its how the korean owners decided they want it done. both chicken and pork are put in a generic clear plastic bag, only difference is the pork gets a tiny shred of news paper in the bottom so when you grab a bag from the freezer you can check the bottom and know what you've grabbed since they look exactly the same once they're both cooked. 

i live in a small town and there aren't many jewish people here, the ones that are most people know who they are because well, they're jewish and thats very obvious. a bunch of them come in as a group pretty often and when its slow and they're the only ones in there i tend to not bother putting pork in the buffet because they no eat. so as i am slaving away at the wok preparing the sesame chicken for the buffet, i'm listening to music kinda spacing out as usual, fill the buffet line and they begin to eat. i start to clean my area up and as i grab the bag to throw it away, there it is. 

*a piece of newspaper in the bottom of the bag and i realize i've fed those poor jewish people sesame pork...*

i'm not religious so i personally don't really give a shit, and nothing really came of it but for some reason i still feel kind of shitty. i mean i guess god wouldn't really care since they did it unknowingly right?

    Here is the article: first post, please tell me if i should change something.

my brother had his bar mitzvah party in august, at a local hotel. we basically just rented out a party room, a common area, and a patio 2 floors up. naturally, since it was his party, and not mine, all his friends were there, and i just sorta chilled with them (which he doesn't like). after complaining to my mom, i finally end up inviting my friend to go watch the new avengers movie (just down the street). we order tickets online, and head off to the theater with some cash for candy. it seemed like the night would work out perfectly, we go to the movie, head back to the hotel, and crash in one of the rooms that were paid for. note, i'm talking about actual rooms, not the place for the party. there was one variable i failed to consider; there was only one keycard, and it was with my brother, at the party, soon to be sleeping sound in a hotel room.

my friend and i come back from the movie (thoroughly enjoyed, by the way), and i had an oh-shit moment when we approached the hotel. i headed up to the 2nd floor and tried to knock on the door, but alas, he was out cold, no way i was being let in from the inside. i decided to spare myself the embarrassment, and sneak some pillows into the party room, which is trashed. my bud and i eventually spoon (for warmth, i swear), because of the lack of blankets. we were falling asleep when, one of the guys working at the front desk comes in, to make sure the room is clear, and sees us spooning. he's clearly holding back laughter as he tells us that the place is gonna get cleaned up and we need to leave.

now there's absolutely no place for us to crash until morning, so i decide to try and get a keycard from the same guy who told me to get out. boy was that awkward. i tell him that i'm locked out of my room, and that's why my bud and i were in the party room (i left out the spooning bit). for security reasons, he can't let me into my room, because the room isn't under my name, and i've got no way of verifying that the person whose name it is under is in fact, my mother. after a few minutes of trying to tell him that it's my room he hands a keycard over with [this](http://drawingwell.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/squint3.jpg) look. i end up getting a few hours of sleep and i am so happy that the same person wasn't working the front desk in the morning.

    Here is the summary: locked out, spooned with friend, got back in

    Here is the article: so i work the night shift in an emergency department that has a steady amount of patients throughout my shift. it isn't a huge hospital in a big city or anything so it is easy to spend a few more minutes talking to patients and their familes and also take a couple minutes out of our shift to do nice things for people in shitty situations. sometimes this means going to get them something from a vending machine or starting their car for them when it's cold out, you know, minor details that are easy for you but mean alot to others. anyway, i was taking care of a patient earlier today and his mother and younger brother were with him in the room. i was making conversation when the little brother (5 or 6 years old) says loudly "i'm bored!". i knew these people might be here for a little while and thought of the perfect idea. i told them i had an old game boy color in my locker with pokémon (yellow version) and asked the mom if i could let the little boy play it. she thought it was a great idea so i grabbed it and told the kid he could start a new game or play whatever was on there because i haven't played it in a year or so. i left the room and told them if i don't see them before the end of my shift to just leave it on the crash cart or counter top and i would grab it later.

 about 45 minutes go by and i'm sitting at the nurses station when the mother comes out of the room and asks if she can talk with me. i went over to her and she shoves my gameboy in my chest and says "i don't appreciate you letting my son play your game that is filled with profanity." i assure her pokémon isn't filled with profanity. this lady was fucking pissed and looked too mad to answer me. she then spurts out some random words that don't make any sense. "donkey-dick" , "twat-waffle", "shit-face".... holy fuck dude. these were the names i gave my pokemon a long ass time ago and didn't even think about it. (i loved naming them shit like that because it made the game more amusing for some fucked up reason) i apologized for the accident but she wasn't having it. she didn't say anything else and i avoided her the entire time they were here. it's my fault i guess. i'm sure i'll hear about it in my manager's office soon. i felt bad but it was an honest accident.

    Here is the summary: i let a little kid play my pokemon game at work, forgetting that i named them all profanities. mom found out and scolded me. i'm probably in trouble.

    Here is the article: so a week ago i went to the local vapeshop to buy a new emty e-liquid bottle. i came home and tried to open the bottle. after several minutes of intensive trying to open up the bottle i searched on reddit if there was a superhero who would know how to open up the bottle. 

after a couple minutes searching on reddit i found what i needed. someone else was having the same issue as me. in the comments a guy said to open it with a knife. so i layed the bottle on his side and tried to open it up by sticking the knife between the cap. the guy in the comments said: "watch out for your fingers". i tried to open te bottle with the knife but i lost grip on the bottle and the knife slides right into my hand. between my finger and tumb. 

i was in shock, my first look at my hand was : "damn there is a huge hole in my hand. so i used some tissues to absorb al the blood and stepped in the car to drive to the nearest hospital. 

when i arrived at the hospital the nurse said that i had cut open a artery, the blood sprang out of the wound. after a suture in my hand i could go back home.

now almost 2 weeks later i still cant hold a glass in my left hand. and i still didn't manage to open the bottle.

    Here is the summary: tried to open bottle with knife. cut myself, damaging an artery. two weeks later, still don't know how to open bottle safely.

    Here is the article: it's 4 in the morning and i'm holding a piece of toilet paper to my balls. *why?* you ask? i'll tell ya why. around 3 in the morning, i get this bright idea, "if i shaved my balls, i wouldn't ever have to deal with it's nuisance again." and with that, i set off to my bathroom to shave my balls. 

razor? check. scissors? check. soaked balls? check. brother's sink filled with water? chhheeeck. 10 minutes in: everything's going according to plan. the feeling of the blade caressing the skin of my nuts; not a thing to be taken lightly. 

i finally finish everything and decide, "i'm gonna go over this again," because lord knows the only good shaved balls are smooth shaved balls. i then rinse and repeat, but this time, i decide to shave *upward* to make sure i get the little follicles out. this...this is where i fucked up. apparently balls can't handle that, so with each and individual hair that is ripped from my crotch, little splotches of blood appear. of course, myself being in the euphoric state i was in, didn't even notice it. after several seconds of wondering why my water has turned red, i look down, and to my horror...*bloody balls*. i start panicking and grab toilet paper to dab at it. turns out it wasn't too bad, so now as i'm typing this, a piece of toilet paper is the only thing getting between my bloody balls, and my clean pair of underwear. and for those who are probably dying to know, yes. my balls are smooth.

    Here is the summary: shave down, easy but prickly. shave up, smooth but bloody.

    Evaluation Criteria:
    1. Read the news article carefully and identify the main topic and key points.
    2. Read the summary and compare it to the news article. Check if the summary covers the main topic and key points of the news article, and if it resents them in a clear and logical order.
    3. Rate the summary with 5 percentages, where each one represents how likely the summary is going to get a score from 1 to 5. For example, if you think the summary is 80% likely to get a score of 5, 10% likely to get a score of 4, 5% likely to get a score of 3, 3% likely to get a score of 2, and 1% likely to get a score of 1, you should rate the summary as 80, 10, 5, 3, 2.

    Here is the article: it's 4 in the morning and i'm holding a piece of toilet paper to my balls. *why?* you ask? i'll tell ya why. around 3 in the morning, i get this bright idea, "if i shaved my balls, i wouldn't ever have to deal with it's nuisance again." and with that, i set off to my bathroom to shave my balls. 

razor? check. scissors? check. soaked balls? check. brother's sink filled with water? chhheeeck. 10 minutes in: everything's going according to plan. the feeling of the blade caressing the skin of my nuts; not a thing to be taken lightly. 

i finally finish everything and decide, "i'm gonna go over this again," because lord knows the only good shaved balls are smooth shaved balls. i then rinse and repeat, but this time, i decide to shave *upward* to make sure i get the little follicles out. this...this is where i fucked up. apparently balls can't handle that, so with each and individual hair that is ripped from my crotch, little splotches of blood appear. of course, myself being in the euphoric state i was in, didn't even notice it. after several seconds of wondering why my water has turned red, i look down, and to my horror...*bloody balls*. i start panicking and grab toilet paper to dab at it. turns out it wasn't too bad, so now as i'm typing this, a piece of toilet paper is the only thing getting between my bloody balls, and my clean pair of underwear. and for those who are probably dying to know, yes. my balls are smooth.

    Here is the summary: I shaved my balls.

    Here is the article: this happened a month ago  
   
i'm a male, freshman in high-school and take geometry honors. just about everyone in my class despises my teacher for one reason or another. i don't hate her. she tries to be nice and tries to crack jokes. and she doesn't try to hate us.  
  
anyways, it's geometry so there are drawings involved. my teacher starts drawing on the board and cracking jokes about what she drew. we all start chiming in and saying her drawings look like dolphins and such. then i say one of her drawings looks like a naked woman referencing ink blot drawings and specifically an episode of some disney show i watched years ago. 
   
well she doesn't gets the reference and just stares at me. then she says something along the lines of, "yeah, i guess i just thought we were mature enough for geometry in here..."  
  
my teacher has been giving me weird looks ever since and i have since confirmed my suspicions of her not liking. on our interim reports i was the only person in the class to get a 3 out of 4 for "social standards" which is basically how well you behave. i probably hadn't said a word in that class up until that day.

    Here is the summary: ** told my geometry teacher that her drawings looked like a naked woman.

    Here is the article: background: i’m a pasty white, gangly male college student. the combination of my long thin limbs and short, man-boob prone torso is mankind’s best proof that god is just making this shit up as he goes along. enough about me and onto the story: every man has his vices. some drink themselves to a stupor, some visit illicit workers behind the back of their beloved, some refuse to flush even after spraying a volume of brown liquid goop into the office toilet that suggests a particularly angry spirit must have taken up residence their asshole, lived a long and fulfilling life, died, and exploded. 


my vice is tamer but infinitely more annoying: i occasionally speak with the tone and inflection of a sassy black woman. i know this habit is slightly racist and i won’t excuse myself by saying that i have black friends of all genders or that i’ve been doing it for a long time. i just never thought that the occasional “mmmhmmm” here and “guuurl” there would make the world a worse place. how naïve i was.


on this day i was at the airport on my way to catch an international flight. i got my ticket and was waiting to get through security. like any good redditor, i have a strong resentment towards the tsa for being useless and inconvenient security theatre. at the time they had recently introduced those millimeter wave body scanners that require you to lift your hands above your head while the machine snaps a picture your naked body for the tsa’s nighttime pleasure. as i imagined bulgy-crotched tsa agents swapping customer pictures in a back alley somewhere, one agent signaled me to go forward (with his hand, not his bulgy crotch). i was annoyed that i had to go through this machine but had too little time to opt for a pat-down. i took off my shoes and all metal items (one of the many times i have been glad to not have any metallic jewelry on my taint) and waited for the agent on the other side of the machine to signal me through. she did.


i entered the belly of the machine. instructions said to place your hands above your head and stand still. i did as it said, but held my hands a little higher and arched my back ever so slightly to achieve a type of dance pose. it was my small act of rebellion against the hopelessly broken system. the machine took a moment to scan my body, perhaps another moment to confirm the truly pitiful state of my dinger, and i was on my way. i exited the machine and the woman held out her hand, stopping me. she pointed to the picture of my pose.


“what was that?” she asked in a stereotypical black woman tone, completely appropriate since she was in fact a black woman.


“it’s muh poseeee,” i responded without thinking, in the exact same tone. time stopped. the other tsa agents (who were also black) gazed over and judged my pathetic, casually racist soul. the only sounds i could hear were those of my butt puckering open and shut, not wanting to be taken in for special examination while simultaneously being concerned that this assumption was only adding to my racist rap sheet. the tsa annoys me and terrifies my butt regardless of race, creed, or color.


after a few seconds of silent puckering the woman started to laugh. the other tsa agents joined her. i considered joining in but decided against it. she signaled that i could go and said “listen, you kinda strange, you know that?”


i willed myself to repress an “mmhmmm” and instead reinforced my whiteness by saying “yeah a little i guess” before collecting my items and running to catch my flight.

    Here is the article: i'm a university student with a huge procrastination problem, but thats pretty common i assume. 

anyways at 1am last night i figure i'll sleep ive been up 15 hours already then after an hour of tumbling and turning my brain suddenly snaps and remembers "i have a history test tomorrow" my heart pounds i snap up grab my history book but then rather than study i kind of get lost in reddit and youtube for hours, then 5am comes i realize i cant fuck around its now 19 hours i haven't slept so i start my 5 hour study session with my book trying to remember everything to be prepared for everything.

hours pass and classes were starting soon so i make my way to campus studying even more on little fact cards i made for on the way to class. walk into class at 9:30 and i don't even feel like i've been up for almost 24 hours i'm ready to do this test. i grab a copy sit down and glance at it, in that moment i feel the weight of my tiredness come back and my stomach sink to my balls as i read the first question... "who is samuel de champlain and what significance does he have?"

it rushes at me that the last 5 hours of studying ancient egypt/china/india and mesopotamia literally means nothing in what i now realize is my canadian history course test and not world history. 

being up 24 hours for a test i didn't study for trying to recall lectures is one of the most mind numbing things i've done and i had to pull out my inner bullshitter to answer the questions, now i'm home and i can only hope i bullshitted hard enough.

    Here is the article: this story takes place around 230 am this morning, so technically today. as my college term ended, i moved back home, and as a result had to put all of my stuff back into my room. with everything in boxes it was hard to maneuver around, so i rearranged it with the furniture accumulated while living in my dorm. everything was the way i wanted it, so i decided i was going to watch some futurama and fall asleep as it had been a long day.

i tried to turn the tv on with the remote but it wouldn't work. i scoured around the house for aaa batteries, but none were to be found. then came my genius idea. i made an ir transmitter so i could control the tv with my phone, instead of having to have the actual remote. i plug it into my headphone jack and launch the app. it wasn't working. i attempted to unplug it from my phone to see what was going on. that's when it snapped in half and wedged itself inside my headphone jack. 

i tried to use the q-tip and super glue method - didn't work. bic pen - didn't work. so my final idea was to take a 1/16" drill bit and get it lodged in the remaining part of the 3.5mm adapter. well that worked; a little too well. the drill bit caught, and powered right through it. it smashed into my haptic feedback module and then the bit pulled right out. the headphone module is still stuck inside my phone, and now i amarillo  unable to listen to audio, talk on the phone without it being on speakerphone, or have it on anything but vibrate. added to that, the haptic feedback isn't working as it should be. 

needless to say, i recharged the batteries for the remote so the screwup won't happen again, and am still in search  for a way to get the metal part out. as a last resort i'll replace the headphone module.

    Here is the article: so i attended this fairly new music festival last weekend with my girlfriend and a few friends. it turned out a crowd about 15,000 strong. 
it's only been going on for a few years, and it seems they haven't quite got running it down to a science yet.
  we had a nice campsite set up, and we were just hanging out when i guy popped his head between two of our tapestries and like he was revving a motorcycle said "shrooom shroom shroooom!"  well, he seemed like he was having a good time so i bought an eighth off him and decided just to eat them all then and there.
    after about an hour, we walked out of the woods and decided to check out some music.
  it seemed like there was a lot of weird stuff going on. it was all very chaotic and debauched. i was following along behind my friends quietly then things started to feel pretty dire. 
    i needed to get away for a minute, so i told them i would catch up to them shortly to the left of the mainstage.
      i went to a water station and drank a little bit, then my stomach rumbled low and menacing, and i felt kind of woozy
     i think, omg!!! i'm going to have to take a shit, but i'll probably feel better after.
  i realize i don't have a flashlight, lighter, or phone....oh well, i have to do this thing now.
     i go over to the portajohns, and there is a guy just coming out. i start to go in and he says, "don't go in there bro."
     i pick another, toilet paper was flowing out the door. i pick another, can't see in far as there were no glowsticks in the urinals, but i can see the tp is gone. one after another i check. no tp in any of them.
  i arrive at the last pj. it's one of the big handicapped kind you can roll a wheelchair in. it's kind of set in a weird way, on uneven ground so it's reclined downhill, but it's stable. the entrance seems pretty nice, no filth flowing out. i go inside and feel the tp dispenser...bingo, a nice fat roll there! thank god !!!
    i stare into the pitch darkness and i can't  make out the rim or what condition it's in.
 i pull a helicopter and hover. no big deal, there is a grab bar running along the side.
    i lower my shorts and grab onto the bar,  lean back and finally drop my payload.
 huge relief!
i don't want to stand up fully until i get in a couple of wipes, so i reach under my arm with my left hand and start unrolling some paper.
 suddenly!!! my fingers slip off the bar and i plunge ass backwards into the darkness!!!
thwuck. i land softly into the bog of eternal stench.
   the toilet had been filled and it was mounded up substantially above the rim and had flowed out onto the whole shelf.
  i soup of shit, sogged toilet paper, and urine.
it was up my ass crack and my balls were buried in it.
   i stood up, pulled up my shorts and got out of there. i made my way in the total dark back to my camp and dug up my towel.
  searched through my gf's shower bag, but couldn't find any soap. only shampoo and conditioner.
  i took my last two gallons of water and soaked my towel before dumping about half a bottle of shampoo on it.
   lather, rinse, repeat.
 
    
 nearly died from disgust.

    Here is the summary: i went to a music festival without a flashlight, got high on mushrooms, went into a portajohn and fell in.

    Here is the article: this happened a couple minutes ago. 

earlier this week i bought an electric toothbrush. when i first pulled it out, my kitten hated it. i let him sniff it, then, being a dick, turned it on and scared him. he genuinely is terrified of it.

well today, i went to brush my teeth, and he poked his head in to see what i was doing. warily, he approached the sink and stepped on to it to gingerly sniff.

i pulled the toothbrush out of my mouth and angled it towards him to sniff, and when it got to within an inch of his face, his brain kicked on.

he was a little orange tornado. he knocked a brass bowl that held combs and floss sticks down and landed on his ass in his litter box, the pot falling on top of his head. combs and floss sticks went all over the litter box, and he bolted like a ninja between my legs, taking with him a large portion of my thigh. now i have skin literally hanging off me and my kitten is backed into a corner, jumping at every touch, poofed to twice his size and hissing at me.

fuck my leg hurts.

    Here is the article: this happened a couple of days ago. be me, moving house about 850km/500 miles away. i take some stuff down to my new place but have to embark on a roadtrip and finish off a few loose ends in my old place over a long weekend off, it had been about 6 weeks. this is in western australia and my old place is in the desert, so it's about a billion degrees in the shade on a cool day at this time of year.  nevertheless, i make the drive back a bit hungover but largely uneventful. got in around 6:30pm.

as soon as i walked in the front door i knew. i knew right away exactly what had happened. i flashed right back to the day after i left and my neighbour sending me a text saying "the power went off here in town but it was back on in about an hour so should be no problems"

there were problems.

the unmistakable odor of rotten meat is pungent. it penetrates your nose. the house was pretty hot inside, the a/c hadn't ran (of course) and it's not the most thermally efficient place. the heat definitely made it worse. the freezer was, at that point, not running and i figured it probably hadn't ran at all since the day the power went out - the main breaker to all the inside power was still tripped. that's weird, when there's a power outage in town that breaker doesn't usually trip, so i hadn't thought to get my neighbor to check it. i didn't leave anything in the fridge because i knew i'd be gone for a while but i thought all the meat in the freezer would be fine.

i decided the best course of action was to power the freezer back up again and try to deal with the lingering smell that was now all over everything left in the house. i ain't opening that thing until those nasty juices are re-frozen again. i flip the circuit breaker back and the freezer hums into life, a few cans of spray disinfectant and toilet scent stuff get dumped all through the kitchen and the house.....i firmly decide that this is a problem for tomorrow /u/g_e0ff and turn in for the night.

in the morning i drag the thing out onto the lawn and crack the freezer door open. heavens above reddit, if that wasn't the worst thing that has ever gone into my nose (including, but not limited to, poor quality australian cocaine), then i'll eat my hat. i immediately power-spew on the lawn - full team america alleyway scene spec powerchucking....i didn't get much value out of my breakfast that day. i am entirely rattled, but i know i have to close the door to put myself back together. i can't get close enough without heaving again so i get a long stick and i'm in the middle of what doubtlessly looked like an absurd man vs fridge ufc match it of footwork when i hear a familiar voice coming down the drive. bart is a redneck, no doubt about it. he's about as aussie as they come and speaks like it too. he drives road trains around wa and pops in when he's coming through town.

"what in the ever loving fuck are you doing geoffrey?!"

bart comes a little closer to see what all the fancy dancing was all about. bart vomits. then my neighbour arrives, employs a little more caution and stays back a ways. we ponder what to do about the situation and seriously consider burning the entire property to the ground (that way we don't have to go anywhere near the fridge again) but decide it against it - i live next door to a fuel storage depot. we'd probably burn the whole town to the ground. eventually a longer stick is tracked down to close the door and stem the flow of what is probably mustard gas or something i don't know.

i had to literally wear a mask and use a fire hose to clean that fridge out and frankly, i don't think it will ever be the same again. neither will i, for that matter.

    Here is the summary: i left town for 6 weeks in the middle of a hot australian desert summer, the power tripped out to my house on day 2 and the freezer thawed, my meat rotted and two of us vomited everywhere sorting it out.

    You will be given one summary written for a news article. Your task is to rate the summary based on the following criteria:
    Output format: PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE

    Evaluation Criteria:
    1. Read the news article carefully and identify the main topic and key points.
    2. Read the summary and compare it to the news article. Check if the summary covers the main topic and key points of the news article, and if it resents them in a clear and logical order.
    3. Rate the summary with 5 percentages, where each one represents how likely the summary is going to get a score from 1 to 5. For example, if you think the summary is 80% likely to get a score of 5, 10% likely to get a score of 4, 5% likely to get a score of 3, 3% likely to get a score of 2, and 1% likely to get a score of 1, you should rate the summary as 80, 10, 5, 3, 2.

    Here is the article: this happened a couple of days ago. be me, moving house about 850km/500 miles away. i take some stuff down to my new place but have to embark on a roadtrip and finish off a few loose ends in my old place over a long weekend off, it had been about 6 weeks. this is in western australia and my old place is in the desert, so it's about a billion degrees in the shade on a cool day at this time of year.  nevertheless, i make the drive back a bit hungover but largely uneventful. got in around 6:30pm.

as soon as i walked in the front door i knew. i knew right away exactly what had happened. i flashed right back to the day after i left and my neighbour sending me a text saying "the power went off here in town but it was back on in about an hour so should be no problems"

there were problems.

    Here is the article: as per usual for this kind of post i will start with some context.

i [m] am in their 20's and have a neighbour [f] in their late teens with a boyfriend who works nights and a small child. we've been neighbours for around 2 - 3 years now. i have always noticed that she flirts with me on numerous occasions, even though throughout knowing her i had a girlfriend (until 2 months ago) and i made it quite obvious to her through text's that i wasn't comfortable with her flirting with me as i'm the loyalist mother fucker you'll ever know when i'm taken. it's worth noting that every girl i have been with has been a slim, delicate flower and quite frankly this girl wasn't that, can you tell i'm recently single? 

so, it's a sunday night, i'm watching jurrassic world through totally legitimate sources and i'm texting my neighbour as a single man without care. fast forward to the part when i'm outside her door, she let's me in and says "are we really going to do this?" to which i replied. "yes, why not?".

so we waddle upstairs and go into the bedroom and she's nervous as fuck worrying whether her boyfriend will find out so i make sure i've definitely got the go ahead before we do this. she definitely wants me, she's just scared and nervous. so we talk a bit on the bed while i'm stroking her legs, her fairly large hams that resembled freshly cut tree farms. this goes on for about half an hour and she's still not calmed down a bit but she still wants me.

so after a lot of stroking and talking, she finally eases up and lets me take off her nightgown to reveal her body which looked like a bust settee. under the covers, i'm about to make my move, i look into her eyes and say do you still want this? she says let's do it and i go in for the kiss. this is where it gets interesting. if you've played air hockey, you know that to score a point the puck has to go through the fairly large goal which is the only analogy i can think of using. that's not even the worst part, i soldier through this for around 10 seconds hoping it will get better when the mother of all tongues comes flying at me like a kamakaze pilot similar to [this (safe for work)](https://youtu.be/y4xlowps6n0?t=17s).

now i'm sure most people would comment and just ask her to wind her neck in a bit, but no. i'm a gentlemen or something like that and since sex is on the table i carry on, move my fingers down her bumpy body and in between her legs. after a while of fiddling and kissing the ox i just can't do it. i'm almost throwing up in my mouth because she's really not my cup of tea and i'd hate to tell her that. so i tell her i can't be with a woman who has a boyfriend and make my way home.

so here i am now typing this up while eating cookie crisp.

    Here is the article: inspired by a recent top post related to ear cleaning, ive decided to share this wonderful fuck up.

a few months back,  i awoke to find my left ear feeling a little closed. and really sticky. obviously theres been a huge buildup of wax, and it was getting kind of gross. against both doctor recommendations, and the instructions on the box of q-tips that clearly say not to stick them in your ear, i did it anyway. because thats how i've always done it. so here i am casually cleaning my ears, im done, i take the q-tip out of my left ear, and suddenly i realized, fuck, i cant hear. i mean, i could still hear, but everything was incredibly muffled, like i was under water. i figured, shit, maybe some cotton got pushed back, but the tip looked fine, it didnt look like anything came apart. in fact, the cotton was actually cleaner than i expected. so i must have pushed the wax further. fine, no big deal, ill just grab a hair pin and scoop out the wax. well, that didnt work either. still couldnt hear. so i called my dad, and went over his way so he can help me.

my dad has a lot of surgical equipment, a machine to suck water and pus and gross shit out of small areas, some cool little camera to stick into ear canals, numbing medication, etc. so we quickly got to work. starting with some hydrogen peroxide, we thought that'd be enough to get the job done. i still couldnt hear clearly, and my ear was still very waxy. we got to scooping. sadly my dad doesnt have the worlds most steady hands at his age, so i kept complaining about the little metal tools he was using to scoop the wax out of my ears, because they were cold, and the inside of the ear canal is very sensitive. my father, not being a patient man decided, "hey why not just numb it with some lidocaine?" yes. my dad dropped a few drops of lidocaine in my ear to numb it, so he could work without me moving.

much like hydrogen peroxide, lidocaine in your ear bubbles and feels nice. but then it doesnt feel nice. as a matter of fact, it starts to burn. and then it really hurts. fast forward a moment, our adventure is done, my ear is tender and red, completely cleaned out, and my hearing was completely gone. like, not a single sound was being processed through that ear. at this point im very scared, and very pissed off. later that afternoon, i did some good ol' googling to find out i caused tramua to my ear canal and i punctured my ear drum. as horrifying as that sounded, turns out not all hope was lost, and i could probably use some medicated ear drops from the local pharmacy to help remedy my situation and clear our the wax. as you can probably guess, that didnt work. in fact, when i was getting the fluid out of my ear, a mix of gooey black stuff, and blood started coming out. a lot of blood. so now im partly deaf and leaking blood down the side of my head. awesome. guess im going to the nearest hospital.

fast-forward sitting in the lobby, checking in and all that, ive got a specialist looking at my ear, and reprimanding me for using q-tips. he told me "it even tells you on the box not to stick q-tips in your ear.". he even knocked on my forehead, looked in my right ear and asked if there was a brain in my head. i never did tell him about the foreign chemicals. but in the end, doc gave me some medication to drop in my ear twice a day, some antibiotics, and i had to keep my ear bandaged for two weeks.

bonus, i was between jobs, and bored as shit at some point during that first week. i decided to trip on acid and go meditate, it was okay for the most part but there was a point during my trip that i felt i was going insane because i only had half my hearing and it almost turned into a really bad trip haha

    Here is the summary: ear was gross, tried cleaning, used some chemicals and caused trauma to my ear canal, tore my eardrum, couldnt hear for about 2 weeks.

    Here is the article: tifu by not reading my phone.

i was reminded of this by an earlier post. 

so i am finishing up my first year of college at one of the highest regarded state funded music schools in the united states (proud of my school) and i have been bad about timing and scheduling this semester. i took too many hours and have been coming to terms with some mental health stuff. 

went to a work party friday night, did the pleasantries of awards, food, then the party really started. i don't drink anymore, so around midnightish i was about ready to leave. my girlfriend and i got in her truck and headed home.

come next morning i wake up on my own around 8:00am and decide to sleep in, "i don't have anything to do" i think. "i've been busting my butt all semester, i can sleep in one day."

at 10:00am an alarm goes off saying "major related final" and i jump out of bed, skip breakfast, and run all the way to my final. normally this wouldn't be that bad, it's only about a quarter mile (400m) but it was raining harder than any rain we have had all year. 

i run into the space sopping wet head to toe, and my teacher looks incredibly confused, and amused. 

the final was at 10:30am

    Here is the summary: read your schedule future college kids. it'll keep you dry.

    Here is the article: now to start this story didn't happen today in fact it took place almost 2 months ago in the middle of april, just before i finished my uni year.
now a little backstory this happened right near the end of my exam period. was done two exams and had just one left, history, no big deal pretty easy just a shit ton to look over and prepare. so i gave myself three days to study for this thing including the day of the exam, it was at about 8 o'clock at night. i don't study at all the first day and don't start studying till about 5 o'clock the second day.


so i'm hanging at my buddies joe's house with another friend andrew. we're all hanging watching tv,playing games and me studying...you know normal stuff. it gets to about 9 or so and we all feel like drinking but we only have enough for the next night when me and andrew are done exams and we can have one last epic outing before we leave for the summer. so joe says how about we get some weed? sure its been a while and we're down. we spend the next hour trying to find any but all our usual contacts are either a)gone home for the summer b)are out or c)can't get to us tonight. fuck! but finally using a buddy from high school i find a guy and me and joe go and get 2g's about 10 mins away. we get back grab a bong and andrew,joe and i go to the bathroom where theres a window for easy access for smoke.


we probably do about a 1/4 of it and think its best to get some food, so we go downstairs to the kitchen and make some food while we watch a movie. eventually we feel like doing it again and we prepare to go upstairs again. at that moment our friend and joe's girlfriend nichole comes and we get her to for the first time hit the bong. so we go upstairs and smoke the rest. we're all standing there, me with my back against the wall. i'm feeling pretty tired its about 11 at night and i had both went to bed at about 4 am the night before and had woken up at about 8am that morning.


now i'm in no way a light weight when it comes to anything but somehow with the combination on me being high and so tired...it suddenly went black. a moment later i'm opening my eyes to nichole,andrew and joe kneeling down asking if i'm okay and looking freaked the fuck out. i suddenly realize what has happened i had gone from leaning against the wall to immediately just smashing my face against the bathroom floor.


the next night when i saw joe next i would find out what actually happened in those moment of me falling asleep. apparently i was leaning and looked like i was trying to fall asleep standing but the balancing was all wrong and i fell forward grabbing out for the first thing that was in hands reach.....the bong. joe caught me and the bong before either of us could hit the ground but he had a dilemma. he could not save either of us from falling just one. he looked over at nichole and andrew for help but they were either in too much awe or were too fucked or perhaps both to help. so joe realizing what he had to do knew that he had to drop the thing that would cause the less shitstorm. his very close friend who wouldn't really care or his roommates bong, whom if you meet him was a bit of a dick. so he did what he had to do and said to me...while at this moment i was also asleep.."shaun i'm so fucking sorry but i have to drop you"...and he did which actually woke me up.
now if that wasn't bad as you recall i had an exam the next night. i awoke the next morning in my girlfriends bed to me very quickly realizing that i was still high, what the fuck was in that weed!!!, studying as hard as i could to study went to the exam that night and for the whole time i was was fearful that i was writing complete gibberish. in the end i actually did quite well on the exam but fuck if i wasn't worried at the time.

    Here is the summary: smoke so much and was so tired that i fell onto a bathroom floor face first asleep also awoke the next day still high with an exam that very day...that i had barely studied for.

we probably do about a 1/4 of it and think its best to get some food, so we go downstairs to the kitchen and make some food while we watch a movie. eventually we feel like doing it again and we prepare to go upstairs again. at that moment our friend and joe's girlfriend nichole comes and we get her to for the first time hit the bong. so we go upstairs and smoke the rest. we're all standing there, me with my back against the wall. i'm feeling pretty tired its about 11 at night and i had both went to bed at about 4 am the night before and had woken up at about 8am that morning.


now i'm in no way a light weight when it comes to anything but somehow with the combination on me being high and so tired...it suddenly went black. a moment later i'm opening my eyes to nichole,andrew and joe kneeling down asking if i'm okay and looking freaked the fuck out. i suddenly realize what has happened i had gone from leaning against the wall to immediately just smashing my face against the bathroom floor.


the next night when i saw joe next i would find out what actually happened in those moment of me falling asleep. apparently i was leaning and looked like i was trying to fall asleep standing but the balancing was all wrong and i fell forward grabbing out for the first thing that was in hands reach.....the bong. joe caught me and the bong before either of us could hit the ground but he had a dilemma. he could not save either of us from falling just one. he looked over at nichole and andrew for help but they were either in too much awe or were too fucked or perhaps both to help. so joe realizing what he had to do knew that he had to drop the thing that would cause the less shitstorm. his very close friend who wouldn't really care or his roommates bong, whom if you meet him was a bit of a dick. so he did what he had to do and said to me...while at this moment i was also asleep.."shaun i'm so fucking sorry but i have to drop you"...and he did which actually woke me up.
now if that wasn't bad as you recall i had an exam the next night. i awoke the next morning in my girlfriends bed to me very quickly realizing that i was still high, what the fuck was in that weed!!!, studying as hard as i could to study went to the exam that night and for the whole time i was was fearful that i was writing complete gibberish. in the end i actually did quite well on the exam but fuck if i wasn't worried at the time.

    Here is the summary: I was studying for my history exam.

For example, if you think the summary is 80% likely to get a score of 5, 10% likely to get a score of 4, 5% likely to get a score of 3, 3% likely to get a score of 2, and 1% likely to get a score of 1, you should rate the summary as 80, 10, 5, 3, 2.

    Here is the article: this happened yesterday. so im home alone this weekend, and my family is 6 hours away. my house is feeling a bit chilly, but i dont want to heat up the whole thing for just one person so i decided to make a fire. the firewood is in the shed outside. i live in canada, it was -25c today with knee-deep snow, i decided not to grab my coat since the shed is pretty close and shorts and a t-shirt are enough. i ran over in the winter boots and went into the shed to grab firewood which i piled at the back. the wind shut the door which locked from the outside, and all of a sudden im locked in a dark shed with no phone and no jacket. after fumbling around in the dark for a while i managed to find a few screwdrivers and take the hinges off the door and open it with a bit of force, after which i had to repair the door again.

    Here is the summary: i locked myself in a shed, it was -25.

    Here is the article: didn't think i was going to be posting on tifu again so soon, but here we go, sit down and buckle up.

i work as a casual at a certain well known fast food chain (we'll call it the scottish restaurant, honestly don't care how much of a dead giveaway it is) and i made a pretty bad mistake.

some context, i've been having blood tests about twice a month to keep tabs on my white blood cell count, having semi-recently returned from papua new guinea with a malaria infection (thank you doxycycline for stopping it from getting any foothold) and with a severe infection in my left leg that fucked the nerves up so that i can't feel anything around my left calf (not sure if permanent) and i happened to have one of those blood tests done this morning, where they fucked up the original sample and for whatever reason, needed to take more than usual.

i'm not supposed to do even moderately heavy lifting for a certain amount of time after a blood test, couldn't see the harm, now i have been shown the light.

i was working in the kitchen of my store this afternoon and had to restock the grillside freezer with more beef patties from the main meat freezer (they come in boxes of >10 kilograms, not certain exactly how heavy they are) and somewhere between the two freezers, the bloody floodgates opened and blood rained down from each arm upon the box, easily getting in. the patties are protected by a plastic wrapping also, but for whatever reason, the top was open and blood poured down into it and contaminated the entire box of beef.

my manager spoke to me on the spot, and nobody's being blamed for the events of today, since this is the first time out of six blood tests that i'd actually had issues with this sort of thing. however, i gave them the dates of future blood tests so they don't roster me on those days to prevent that happening again.

    Here is the summary: ; picked up a box, contaminated several kg of beef with blood

    Here is the article: despite "ghost hunting" being in the title, nothing spoopy is going to happen.  however, i grant you all permission to laugh at how much of an ass i made of myself.
yesterday, my classmate invited me ghost hunting.  i immediately wanted to go since i'm a big fan of the ghost stories that get submitted on reddit such as the ones in r/nosleep, which was a major reason for me to get super hyped.  she said to be there at 7:30, yet she did not say which building to meet her in; all i got was a very vague street address.
because i'm an overconfident idiot, i thought i could leave at around seven and get there with the help of google maps.  i was expecting to find a group of students, including the classmate that invited me, waiting outside nearby where i had stopped at my destination right on the edge of the crosswalk, and i see no one outside.  suddenly, i remember hearing her say they were going to meet in a building of some sort.
i walk into the nearest building, which is the school of public health/sports and recreation center.  i should've noticed there was a red flag there the minute i walked in- i mean, why the hell would a ghost hunting group meet in a building like that (unless it were haunted, but it wasn't)?  also, my classmate told me to meet in "the second classroom by the library", and i highly doubt this building has a library unless it's a medical library with texts on medical studies and whatnot; even then i'd have the worst time finding it because i was unfamiliar with the building- in fact, that was the first time i had even been inside that building.
the biggest blow to the gut, though, was finding out that i was on the wrong street the whole time.  the moment i found this out, i figured they'd already left without me, anyway, so i might as well go back to the apartment.  i was heartbroken.  this was going to be my first time ghost hunting, and i fucking blew it.  i may likely never get a chance like this again.  i actually cried a little.
i don't know why i kept trying.  i have no experience with ghost hunting, and it's not like the group would've wanted me there, anyway.  not only am i unpopular due to being loud, socially awkward, and ugly (especially with my glasses on), but i'm not someone it would be a smart idea to take ghost hunting, anyway.  i would probably draw attention to the group by taunting the ghost and angering it, thus getting everyone cursed or something along those lines.  none of this matters, though.  what matters is that i missed an opportunity to do something exciting that i've only heard about people doing on the internet and i'm sad about it.

    Here is the summary: i go out to go ghost hunting but end up getting myself lost, thus making an ass of myself and proving why no one would want me joining them.

    Here is the article: **this all happened about 4 years ago.**  
  
i was in my third year of getting my ba in media arts and in the middle of taking one of my least favorite classes.    

 now this class was taught by a professor who was universally reviled by pretty much everyone in the department, both student and faculty alike (her rate my professor rating currently stands at 1.8, with 64 reviews dating back to 2004). the only reason she was still even in the department was because she had tenure. to give you an idea as to what she looked like, here's a picture of the [heatmiser](http://images4.fanpop.com/image/photos/17600000/heat-miser-classic-christmas-cartoons-17601846-217-232.jpg) -- now imagine that but fatter, older and african-american.  the only reason anyone ever even took a class with her was because she had a small monopoly on the major elective classes in which she was the sole teacher -- meaning it was either take a class with her or never graduate (i seriously considered the latter option for a while).
  

  
anyway, the mid-term for the class taught by this professor   
(for the sake of speeding this along, i'll refer to her by the pseudonym i used in college - the **w**icked **w**itch of the **w**est)   
was a joint-production with her acting class. the project was to film a small news package on a select topic.   
i, along with 5 other people were assigned to do our project on the local eagle scout troupe that meets in the basement of a nearby united methodist church.  
the preliminary shoot went well enough, but we forgot to get an exterior shot of the church itself. it ended up being the last thing we needed for the project by the time most of the editing was done so about a week later, my group and i went back to the church during the day to get our last shot.  
    

our initial plan was for our "reporter" (the acting student from www's acting class) to give a quick introduction to the camera in front of the church and use the footage as an intro for the project.  

unfortunately, we got to the church in the middle of rush hour (the church was on the corner of an intersection) so it was impossible to get good audio since there were 3-4 cars rushing past us every other minute. on top of that, the camera equipment we borrowed from the school was busted.     

while we were trying to find a way to fix the equipment, a car suddenly pulled up next to us. an older heavy-set woman, most likely in her 50s-60s, opened her car window and asked us in a sing-songy way "what are you kids doing?"  
we explained that we were doing a project for college. the woman just said "oh, okay!" smiled at us, then drove away.  
  
we didn't know what to make of the woman's appearance so we went back to trying to salvage our location shoot.  
  
about 15 minutes later, right as we were about to call it a day and head back to the school - the *same* car from earlier screeches into the parking lot of the church. out steps a slightly larger woman than before, but one that looks nonetheless strikingly similar to the woman who had approached us earlier.  
  
the woman immediately anger-walked towards us and while waving her index finger said "*exuuuuse* me, but what do you think you're doing?"  
  
we then tried to explain as we did to the woman earlier, that we were filming a project for school.  
    

"well, i'm the pastor at this church and i did not get any notice about anyone filming today!"  
    

we then explained that we had permission from the eagle scout leader as well as our professor, the www, who supposedly arranged everything. 
    
"i have not heard of this www, but i will definitely give her a call about this"  
  
we then tried to tell the pastor that we were leaving anyway and didn't even get any footage of her church but she ignored us and continued waddling towards her car.
  
it was at this point that my friend and fellow crew member, will, asked the pastor: "weren't you here earlier?"  
  
the pastor then turned around and simply said "no, that was my wife." the pastor then went into her car and took off down the road.  
  
we were all a bit gobsmacked by what just happened, but we shrugged it off and submitted our project the next day before taking off for the weekend.  
  
it wasn't until we returned to the www's classroom that we learned the full ramifications of our seemingly innocuous actions.   
  
after taking attendance, www sat at her desk and took a deep breath.
  
"i got an interesting e-mail over the weekend"  
 
my heart immediately sank as www began to fold her fingers and look directly at me and my group.

"the pastor at the local church you guys were filming at told me about how you treated her. she said that you were 'rude and disrespectful' and that you were filming without any permission."  
  
we immediately tried to deny the pastor's claims but www wasn't having any of it.  
 
"i don't want to hear any excuses. i just want you to know that in all of my years of teaching, **i have never been more embarrassed and humiliated** than i was after reading this e-mail that she sent me."  
  
we tried once more to say that we didn't even film anything but once again, www was beyond reason at this point.  
  
"no, what you are going to do is write a note - not just an e-mail - and you are going to send it to this pastor. you are going to apoligize for your behavior and you are each going to sign it personally. **if you do not do this, i will drop your project grades by a letter**. do i make myself clear?"  
     

there was no use in arguing, so we finally stopped trying to defend ourselves and just bit the bullet. i typed up the letter and we all signed it and sent it to the pastor.   
the worst part about the whole thing was that for a while, nobody believed us, it was our word against www.  
  
suffice it to say, the rest of my college experience was not nearly as tumultuous as my time in www's classes (i was forced to take another class with her, but that's a story for another day).    

but if there's any silver lining it's this - i graduated the semester before **www officially became the head of the media arts department** and began a reign of terror that i am forever grateful to have been spared from...

    Here is the summary: had to film a school project at a church. lesbian pastor saw this and despite our claims that we had permission to film at her church, angrily emailed our professor (who was basically evil btw). evil professor made me and my group sign and send an apology letter to the pastor for how we "treated her," and threatened to demote our grades if we didn't.

    You will be given one summary written for a news article. Your task is to rate the summary based on the following criteria:
    Output format: PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE

    Evaluation Criteria:
    1. Read the news article carefully and identify the main topic and key points.
    2. Read the summary and compare it to the news article. Check if the summary covers the main topic and key points of the news article, and if it resents them in a clear and logical order.
    3. Rate the summary with 5 percentages, where each one represents how likely the summary is going to get a score from 1 to 5. For example, if you think the summary is 80% likely to get a score of 5, 10% likely to get a score of 4, 5% likely to get a score of 3, 3% likely to get a score of 2, and 1% likely to get a score of 1, you should rate the summary as 80, 10, 5, 3, 2.

    Here is the article: **this all happened about 4 years ago.**  
  
i was in my third year of getting my ba in media arts and in the middle of taking one of my least favorite classes.    

 now this class was taught by a professor who was universally reviled by pretty much everyone in the department, both student and faculty alike (her rate my professor rating currently stands at 1.8, with 64 reviews dating back to 2004). the only reason she was still even in the department was because she had tenure. to give you an idea as to what she looked like, here's a picture of the [heatmiser](http://images4.fanpop.com/image/photos/17600000/heat-miser-classic-christmas-cartoons-17601846-217-232.jpg) -- now imagine that but fatter, older and african-american.  the only reason anyone ever even took a class with her was because she had a small monopoly on the major elective classes in which she was the sole teacher -- meaning it was either take a class with her or never graduate (i seriously considered the latter option for a while).
  

  
anyway, the mid-term for the class taught by this professor   
(for the sake of speeding this along, i'll refer to her by the pseudonym i used in college - the **w**icked **w**itch of the **w**est)   
was a joint-production with her acting class. the project was to film a small news package on a select topic.

    Here is the article: throwaway for obvious reasons.

sitting here high as fuck, and thinking about my most fucked up moment at the moment. 
 but since i always reading /r/tifu and enjoying the content of it, i also needed to post something.

so this was my last day out in hong kong (went to various asian countries for a period of 1 month), and i went to a beer-festival in lkf with friends. had a great time there and after some drinking we went clubbing.

after some swaps between clubs, we ended up in a club hanging around with a girl-friend (yea literally like a female friend) of one of my friend and another girl.
 the other girl (let's call her "k") was cute so me being a thirsty guy, went to talk with her. so at this point being a thirsty dude isn't a problem, just meeting new people is okay'ish. 
 in the club "k" asked if i wanted to smoke and i had no problem with that, but she offered me not a cigarette but a joint (some background: i smoke weed in most of my free time and hanging around with mates). having not smoked weed in almost a month (since i'm on vacation) i thought: "having a joint at this moment is like the best moment in a long time". so we went up a hill and smoking with "k" was like one of my greater moments in life, she was funny, had a great character and you can go on with the list.
 pretty much i couldn't stop talking because she was that nice. and also since i've not smoked weed for a month, i was pretty much in the skies being high as fuck.

after having great time at the hill we went back to the club. in the club still being high as fuck, she was dancing with me. so "k" was probably thinking the dude (me) is a pretty cool guy (no self admire intended). 
 so at this point she was kinda grinding me, and since i was pretty high away in the skies my brains went all dogthirsty asshole mode. i proceeded to touch her more and she was still okay with that, but after a longer period she wanted to get some more space. 
 but somehow my high ass fuck brains still wouldn't turn the thirsty mode off. after some 10 minutes "k" started to act like she was being detached from me, but my brains were still in the higher skies and i thought she was having a bad trip. so i helped her getting and after some water she wanted to leave. 

i didn't had a problem with that because i thought that was the best option to do (since i thought she was really having a bad trip). so we searched for my friend and his girl-friend, and after meeting up with them we proceeded to get out of the club.
 my stupid thirsty brain somehow thought i was going home with her alone, but she just wanted to get in the bus, going to my busstation and getting a cab from there (because that's the better choice for her). after that i realized i fu so hard... 

i never should have treated "k" that badly, i'm realizing that i've been a thristyassstupid a-hole. i wanted to much and that went horribly wrong.
"k" brought me the best night of my vacation and i treated her like garbage. of course she wants to dance with me and maybe some grinding but i just went overboard. 
 she probably didn't had a bad trip, and just wanted to get some space but i was just to stupid to think straight. she's a great girl and probably just wanted to hang as friends (which i totally don't mind, but it's already way to late). i'm just having so much regret now at this moment, and wishing i could get back in time or whatever to fix this fu. 
 it's like i kicked a handicapped man from hes wheelchair, it feels like i laughed at a disabled person.. i always thinking in my mind that those people are miserable and now i'm like one of those people hahahahahhahaha (still high as fuck, sorry).  

but the worst is that i don't even asked her number or some different social media thingy. 
 i can't even ask her if she is okay or not tomorrow... (only option is to make contact via my friend).

but i'll probably do that tomorrow!

    Here is the summary: last day out of my vacation, girl brings me one of my happiest and greatest time of my life. but ended up acting like one stupid douchbag thirsty guy...

so this was my last day out in hong kong (went to various asian countries for a period of 1 month), and i went to a beer-festival in lkf with friends. had a great time there and after some drinking we went clubbing.

after some swaps between clubs, we ended up in a club hanging around with a girl-friend (yea literally like a female friend) of one of my friend and another girl.
 the other girl (let's call her "k") was cute so me being a thirsty guy, went to talk with her. so at this point being a thirsty dude isn't a problem, just meeting new people is okay'ish. 
 in the club "k" asked if i wanted to smoke and i had no problem with that, but she offered me not a cigarette but a joint (some background: i smoke weed in most of my free time and hanging around with mates). having not smoked weed in almost a month (since i'm on vacation) i thought: "having a joint at this moment is like the best moment in a long time". so we went up a hill and smoking with "k" was like one of my greater moments in life, she was funny, had a great character and you can go on with the list.
 pretty much i couldn't stop talking because she was that nice. and also since i've not smoked weed for a month, i was pretty much in the skies being high as fuck.

after having great time at the hill we went back to the club. in the club still being high as fuck, she was dancing with me. so "k" was probably thinking the dude (me) is a pretty cool guy (no self admire intended). 
 so at this point she was kinda grinding me, and since i was pretty high away in the skies my brains went all dogthirsty asshole mode. i proceeded to touch her more and she was still okay with that, but after a longer period she wanted to get some more space. 
 but somehow my high ass fuck brains still wouldn't turn the thirsty mode off. after some 10 minutes "k" started to act like she was being detached from me, but my brains were still in the higher skies and i thought she was having a bad trip. so i helped her getting and after some water she wanted to leave. 

i didn't had a problem with that because i thought that was the best option to do (since i thought she was really having a bad trip). so we searched for my friend and his girl-friend, and after meeting up with them we proceeded to get out of the club.
 my stupid thirsty brain somehow thought i was going home with her alone, but she just wanted to get in the bus, going to my busstation and getting a cab from there (because that's the better choice for her). after that i realized i fu so hard... 

i never should have treated "k" that badly, i'm realizing that i've been a thristyassstupid a-hole. i wanted to much and that went horribly wrong.
"k" brought me the best night of my vacation and i treated her like garbage. of course she wants to dance with me and maybe some grinding but i just went overboard. 
 she probably didn't had a bad trip, and just wanted to get some space but i was just to stupid to think straight. she's a great girl and probably just wanted to hang as friends (which i totally don't mind, but it's already way to late). i'm just having so much regret now at this moment, and wishing i could get back in time or whatever to fix this fu. 
 it's like i kicked a handicapped man from hes wheelchair, it feels like i laughed at a disabled person.. i always thinking in my mind that those people are miserable and now i'm like one of those people hahahahahhahaha (still high as fuck, sorry).  

but the worst is that i don't even asked her number or some different social media thingy. 
 i can't even ask her if she is okay or not tomorrow... (only option is to make contact via my friend).

but i'll probably do that tomorrow!

    Here is the summary: I went to a beer-festival in lkf with friends.

    You will be given one summary written for a news article. Your task is to rate the summary based on the following criteria:
    Output format: PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE

    Evaluation Criteria:
    1. Read the news article carefully and identify the main topic and key points.
    2. Read the summary and compare it to the news article. Check if the summary covers the main topic and key points of the news article, and if it resents them in a clear and logical order.
    3. Rate the summary with 5 percentages, where each one represents how likely the summary is going to get a score from 1 to 5. For example, if you think the summary is 80% likely to get a score of 5, 10% likely to get a score of 4, 5% likely to get a score of 3, 3% likely to get a score of 2, and 1% likely to get a score of 1, you should rate the summary as 80, 10, 5, 3, 2.

    Here is the article: so i work in retail and the holidays suck to work through. i had just got out at 11:00pm after the mall had closed at 9:00. i was exhausted. we finish closing the store and i grab my leftover food from break, the trash that needed to go to the dumpster (which was on my way to my car), and the coke i was saving all night. i toss the trash, finish my coke and make it home when i realized i didn't have my leftovers. i retrace my steps and i realize that the trash and my lunch bag were in the same hand when i threw out the trash. and i remember that i had walked to my car with just the coke. i got really sad because it was dumpster that compacts all the trash together so it was 100% dead. that was my bag that went missing for a year and i had found it that week. it's a sad world.

    Here is the summary: took out the trash after work, threw away my long lost lunch bag too.

    Here is the article: in honor of the hef's recent passing, i would like to share the story of how 11yo me got caught sneaking a look at my dad's playboy magazine collection.  
  
this was, oh, let's say 1973 or so.  i was 11 and just beginning to realize that boobs=awesome.  i knew that my dad had a stash of playboys in the credenza in his den because we weren't allowed to go in there (so of course we went in there whenever we thought we could get away with it).  i'd like to think that iamverysmart because i remember *also* enjoying the articles, cartoons, interviews, and of course jokes.  mostly, though, i liked playboy because of the boobs and probably most of all because it was forbidden fruit.  
  
because i was 11 years old, the jokes were particularly useful.  they were the one thing i could take away from the magazine.  it wasn't like i could share the pictures with friends, because i had to be utterly stealthy about making sure i put the issues back in *exactly* the same order in the stack or my dad might know i had checked them out!  
  
my family was having our weekly sunday dinner, and things were going great.  our parents made us tell stories about school, talk about our friends, tell them what was going on in our lives, even tell jokes and do little skits sometimes.  
  
it was my turn to chime in, but i couldn't think of anything- and then inspiration struck!  i remembered this one joke, vaguely.  it was a bit long, and had a hilarious (if just ever so slightly naughty) punch line.  best of all, the humor would be lost on my younger brothers, making me appear mature for my age.  so i launched into it, eager to be considered adultish in front of my parents.  about two paragraphs into the joke, i realized where i had heard it.  because i hadn't heard it; i'd read it.  in the most recent issue of playboy on the page right after the playmate's bio (fun fact: there's a sniglet for that.  it's called a "bimbio").  
  
i immediately turned bright purple.  words.  wouldn't.  i scrambled for a way out.  started using words like "my friend frank said the next part goes like..." but it was too late. i was committed.  i hacked out the punch line, gave a weak smile and a half laugh and watched my mom & dad look at each other with parental telepathy and one raised eyebrow each.  
  
my dad bailed me out by saying something like "hmmm.  i think i know where 'frank' got that joke from.  i read it in a ... *magazine* recently."  but it was pretty clear he meant "lenny" not "frank."  
  
the next time i sneaked into the den to check out the treasure trove, the credenza was empty.  my access to the holy of holies was revoked!  no more boobs for me.  the only consolation prize was that a couple of months later i was given a subscription to mad magazine, which (although it was never said) was a way of giving me (slightly) more age-appropriate source material.

    Here is the summary: told a joke that i'd read in my dad's stash of playboy magazines at the family dinner table.  mom & dad both recognized it immediately.  dad either cancelled his subscription or hid his playboys better because i never found them again.

    Here is the article: this actually happened some time ago, and could have had really bad consequences.

i used to work in a very nice building, with an attached covered parking building next to it. so, one rainy day, i arrived to the office. the parking building has a speed limit of 5mph - obviously nobody respects it, but in the other hand, most people don't go faster than 15-20mph there.

anyway. i arrived that day just behind a nice car... and they are going at 5mph, respecting the building speed limits. i'm absolutely ok with it, and although we are really going really slow, it's fine. the people in the nice car ahead of me seem unfamiliar with the building - probably visitors. i was really happy that morning, and thinking that i was too close to them. i didn't want them to think i was tailgating them, as they were going really slow.

that is when ifu. my wild imagination started working. i though, that as much as i was happy to be going 5mph, i imagined that a jerk and ass would be pissed with the guys ahead of me. not me, of course. so, my wild imagination started working, picturing this evil person, tailgating this poor lost guys, even honking at them. honking!! in texas nobody ever honks. wow, what an ass is this imagination guy. probably driving a bmw.

while thinking about this evil person, i realized i didn't know where was the horn in my car, as i never use it. where could it be? never even hear the horn in this car... mmm.... aaaaand... i pressed the middle of my steering wheel. beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep !!!!.
omg - the horn in my car just made the most annoying and loud honk i could imagine, and got stuck for probably what it felt like an eternity. 

when i looked up - the guys ahead had veered to the side of the road in the building, so i could pass.

the shame. i wanted to explain that it was a mistake, that i couldn't have honked on purpose. i waved my arms and hands inside my car trying to say sorry!! but it seems that my gestures inside my car where not very visible.

i was ashamed.... 

later the day, i realized a couple of high level visiting executives where talking about the jerk that honked like a crazy mad man at them in the parking building. he even cursed at them. they couldn't recognize him, but he seemed to be cursing and yelling to them inside his car.

yep - i made sure i didn't approach my car the whole day, until everybody left.

    Here is the summary: my imagination made me honk to a couple of innocent guys in a parking building.

when i looked up - the guys ahead had veered to the side of the road in the building, so i could pass.

the shame. i wanted to explain that it was a mistake, that i couldn't have honked on purpose. i waved my arms and hands inside my car trying to say sorry!! but it seems that my gestures inside my car where not very visible.

i was ashamed.... 

later the day, i realized a couple of high level visiting executives where talking about the jerk that honked like a crazy mad man at them in the parking building. he even cursed at them. they couldn't recognize him, but he seemed to be cursing and yelling to them inside his car.

yep - i made sure i didn't approach my car the whole day, until everybody left.

    Here is the summary: I arrived at the office behind a nice car that was going at 5mph, respecting the building speed limits.

    You will be given one summary written for a news article. Your task is to rate the summary based on the following criteria:
    Output format: PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE

    Evaluation Criteria:
    1. Read the news article carefully and identify the main topic and key points.
    2. Read the summary and compare it to the news article. Check if the summary covers the main topic and key points of the news article, and if it resents them in a clear and logical order.
    3. Rate the summary with 5 percentages, where each one represents how likely the summary is going to get a score from 1 to 5. For example, if you think the summary is 80% likely to get a score of 5, 10% likely to get a score of 4, 5% likely to get a score of 3, 3% likely to get a score of 2, and 1% likely to get a score of 1, you should rate the summary as 80, 10, 5, 3, 2.

    Here is the article: so yesterday (disclaimer blah blah) i was dicking around on my computer and saw a headline that there was a free demo for ffxv. being thirsty for anything related to the game i dusted off my ps4, found the demo in the playstation store, and set it downloading. my ps4 and pc share a monitor so i just set down the controller, switched to my pc's input and continued dicking around. i soon forgot about the download and the fact i even own a ps4.

the fu comes when i decided to play a game on my pc. the game is meant to be played using a gamepad and like my monitor i use my ds4 controller for both my ps4 and pc needs. fast-forward about a half hour and i suddenly remember the download. i switch to my ps4's input, full of excitement for the demo and instead find myself looking at the store page for the movie "creed". a moment of confusion followed by my stomach dropping as i realized my mistake.

for a half hour while i had been mashing buttons killing pixelated monsters, my controller had also been using the input to navigate the playstation store. through some miracle i had only manage to make a couple purchase amounting to $30 combined, but the sense of abject terror i felt in between realizing my mistake and checking my card still haunts me.

    Here is the summary: started a download on my ps4 then used the same controller to play a game on my pc. while i was playing the pc game i also accidentally purchased two movies i couldn't care less about.

    Here is the article: this happened this morning. names changed cause yaknow. 

i was invited a few week's ago to my friend's bridal shower and rsvp'd. i'd never been to the house where it was being held but i had google maps so no problem. so this morning i mapped the address and drove out there and parked on this super packed street in the neighborhood. i'm looking at the house number in my phone which ends in "37" and i see a house that ends in "31." confused, i start looking around but can't see house numbers very well. just as i'm about to go walking around these two women were like "it's this house" and pointed to the "31" house with the bridal bow on the door. so i'm like "well my address says '37'?" and they say "well it's this one!" so i think okay maybe it was just written wrong. 


i go in this house and this tall beautiful girl i've never seen before answers the door wearing this pretty white dress and i ask her, "is this susie's bridal shower?" and she's like "yeah." i'm thinking....why is this girl wearing white at susie's bridal shower? isn't that like a faux pas? oh well. i look around and susie and my other friend jenny aren't there. figuring they were just late (to her own bridal shower?) i figured i'd just mingle for a bit until they got there. also all the decorations for the shower were so pink and i thought "wow these people don't know susie very well if this is what they chose for her." it didn't even match her wedding theme. i know, i know, red flags. everywhere. 

so then everyone is grabbing food so i go get a plate full of nosh and sit down with my food and sort of follow the convos of other people and then i eat some donut holes from the pretty donut display and just keep thinking "...man i have never seen any of these people before. and where are my friends??"

about 15 minutes pass, at least, and i realize i have a text from jenny that says "are you lost??" and then... i realized. yes, yes i am lost. 

i run outside and call her and she doesn't answer and i go back into the house and ask a little old lady "whose house is this?! is it susies? is this susies party??" and she's like "well, susie is the mother of the bride?" and i'm like "oh my god im in the wrong house."

i then realized my card was still on the gift table across the room so i couldn't just back out the door, so i dart over to the gift table, yoink my card back and run out of the house without another word. i didn't say sorry or goodbye, i just left. to which i then ended up literally next door at the correct bridal shower. which was taking place at the exact same time. with two people with the same name. what are the chances?

at least i have a story to tell when people ask about my most embarrassing moment.

    Here is the summary: went to the neighbors house for their bridal shower instead of my friends shower. ate all their food before i realized my mistake.**

    Here is the article: some false information is included, and it happened like few days ago or a year or so.

i was driving as fast as i could, in the cold of the rainy night, without killing anybody. i work at a customer service job, and that night i was on the single night shift. at the time i was out there finishing some requests from other customers, but customers kept calling me saying that they are in the front of the office so come back. and i even had no time to eat a dinner.

so i was simply driving and found a nice big parking spot up ahead. "yay! i can park there for now!" i thought, all happy and dreary and hungry. i turn my car to there. then, metal-against-metal sound hits my ears. long vibration. heart dropped instantly, fear is in the air. did i just skid a car? i thought to myself. on the company van, of all things?

i go out. my legs are trembling but i had to see. i check the damage. the cover of the side mirror is gone. i don't see any other damage and just in case took several pictures, but since it's white, and it's an dark rainy night, i'm not sure if i can even make out the damage even if there is one...except for the cover of the mirror is nowhere to be found.

i contacted the manager and did everything he told me to do, including leaving a note saying to contact us. assist. manager decided to drop a call in so i told him as well, and he said mirror doesn't cost much so it's ok, but still it's a cost to the company. but like this was my first time ever driving a van. i only had a small car before. so i don't know how vans work, including the damage extent. and since this is the first time i drove it and this happened...i don't think they will ever let me drive it again.

    Here is the summary: i skidded a private owner car with a company car and i think i will be fired. and i feel like killing myself now.

    Here is the article: some false information is included, and it happened like few days ago or a year or so.

i was driving as fast as i could, in the cold of the rainy night, without killing anybody. i work at a customer service job, and that night i was on the single night shift. at the time i was out there finishing some requests from other customers, but customers kept calling me saying that they are in the front of the office so come back. and i even had no time to eat a dinner.

so i was simply driving and found a nice big parking spot up ahead. "yay! i can park there for now!" i thought, all happy and dreary and hungry. i turn my car to there. then, metal-against-metal sound hits my ears. long vibration. heart dropped instantly, fear is in the air. did i just skid a car? i thought to myself. on the company van, of all things?

i go out. my legs are trembling but i had to see. i check the damage. the cover of the side mirror is gone. i don't see any other damage and just in case took several pictures, but since it's white, and it's an dark rainy night, i'm not sure if i can even make out the damage even if there is one...except for the cover of the mirror is nowhere to be found.

i contacted the manager and did everything he told me to do, including leaving a note saying to contact us. assist. manager decided to drop a call in so i told him as well, and he said mirror doesn't cost much so it's ok, but still it's a cost to the company. but like this was my first time ever driving a van. i only had a small car before. so i don't know how vans work, including the damage extent. and since this is the first time i drove it and this happened...i don't think they will ever let me drive it again.

    Here is the summary: I was driving as fast as I could, in the cold of the rainy night, without killing anybody.

    Here is the article: to start off i did not fuck up today, my fuck up occurred this past sunday and also i apologizer for the length but i like to set the scene accurately. so its about 6:30 in the evening and i'm hanging out in my two friends' room, lets call them kyle and manny. kyle smoked less than an hour before so he was still pretty high when he suddenly announced that he would be having a special lady over at 7 that night, our friend named kristen (for the purposes of this story). manny quickly exclaimed that we both needed to get out so he could rub one out before being sexiled. kyle was not happy about this but was not in any position to argue as he was kicking us out without much warning. a few short minutes later manny had finished up and walked down the hall to my room. now manny and i had both had prior experiences with kristen earlier on this year and since then she had acquired a reputation of being pretty easy but she was still in our close circle of friends. but we figured this would be the perfect opportunity to play a little prank on the two of them. we would of course hide in the room and surprise them when they least expected it. when kyle went to get the door for kristen manny and i ran swiftly ran into the room and hid, he in the closest me under manny's bed, across the room from kyle's bed. seconds after we were situated in our respective hiding spots kyle and kristen enter the room and sit down on kyle's bed. they start talking for awhile mean while manny and i text each other making fun of our stoned friend asking "how was your day?" to her 4 times in a row. we had always planned to spring out before things got serious but heres where the fuckup came. it was up to me to initiate the surprise, manny was clear that it was on me to be the first and he would follow suit, but at the perfect time during a lull in conversation i froze, i couldn't move. next thing i know i hear them start to hook up and clothes hit the floor. i think shit if i do it now i'll look like i was waiting for them to get undressed before i popped out, maybe if i wait a little longer. unfortunately, in my panicked state i didn't fully comprehend what waiting longer meant. manny and i were trapped for 40 minutes as our two friends went to town on each other, a veritable eternity of horrendous groaning and squeaking made all the worse by the ever increasing loss of feeling in my arm as it fell asleep due to my position. manny is likewise suffering through leg cramps from squatting in the closet the whole time. when the finished i thought our ordeal was over but it was not to be so for kristen decided it would be a great time for a post-coital episode of bob's burgers. this is where my will broke, i could take no more. i texted kyle desperately trying to salvage the situation in the hopes that he would make a clever cover for manny and i to escape unnoticed by kristen but instead of helping us he did the exact opposite. as soon as he got the text he stood up and said to kristen "you'll never believe this but manny and das_porker have been here the whole time" "manny, das_porker come out right now!" i waited for him to say it three times before i finally popped out from underneath the bed and hightailed it the fuck out of the room with manny in tow.

as of today kyle has gotten over his anger and now thinks its the funniest thing he's ever heard. manny and i apologized to kristen but understandably, she still feels really upset about the whole thing and hasn't talked to either of us since. i am also pretty sure people on this campus think i get off to other people having sex.

    Here is the summary: tried to prank my friend, was stuck in his room and heard him have sex and got caught now everyone thinks im a sexual deviant

    Here is the article: this story actually happened four months ago.

background, me and my ex broke up a four year relationship a few months ago and in the first days we would still meet sometimes, and this fucked up is part of one of this meets.

so i was in my best friend's house for some beers and chips when i received her text asking if i wanted to meet. i was a little drunk and horny so why not. we decided to go to a place more private, a allotment to be more precise. there, we started drinking a bottle of vodka that we bought it and kissing. so we decided, let's go to a motel.

arriving in the motel room the first thing i see is this huge empty jacuzzi, instantly decided to fill it up. put some bath salt, some shampoo, soap, everything the room had that could make bubbles. the jacuzzi started to fill but yet no bubbles, so i look to a button and thought "maybe this will turn on the jacuzzi and the water shaking definitely will make bubbles" so i pressed and make my way to the toilet to pee. in there i started to hear a really loud sound and my ex running through the room. instantly left the toilet and for my surprise the jacuzzi was like a blew up hydrant. the room started to flood and there's water everywhere. i take the phone and call the staff, raging.

"yes?" they said

"well, the jacuzzi just blew up in my room, there's water everywhere, the room is fucking flooding!!"

"please, leave the room, i'll send our staff to solve your problem, sir"

so i headed to the garage, waiting, and hear the staff running in the room, screaming. suddenly, all stops, and they yell from inside "you can come in". so i did. there's like 1/2 ft water in the room, totally flooded. i standed there for a second when the phone started to ring. it's the staff.

turns out, you can not turn the jacuzzi on until it's full with water (i didn't know that).

"sir, you should not have turn the jacuzzi on until it was full. you messed up the motors and the plumbing of it"

"okay.... hmmm... sorry" embarresed.

"no problem, we will send you the check later"

basically. a u$20 motel room became a u$500 motel room.

    Here is the summary: blew up a jacuzzi, flooded the whole place, and have to pay $500 to the staff for a $20 motel room!

    Here is the article: so we begin..

always checking into this sub, i've wondered "when will my tifu would happen?" this happened earlier this week and had to save the post for the weekend.

for a little background i live in mountains in northern california. i frequently rove into the woods on my property to cut down dead trees for firewood. growing up back east in new jersey, i've always gotten the spooks from ticks, especially the idea of lymes disease. i always check myself for ticks.

now on monday, i go off into the woods and do the usual but for some reason it really kicked my ass. exhausted afterwards, i go inside and throw myself on the couch. laying there i think to myself, "i gotta check for ticks." telling myself i'll to it later, i was too tired. the cat and dogs do every now and then. for me personally, i've never had a showdown with one of these bastards since i was probably 7. laying on the couch, i fall asleep.

tuesday comes, and i completely forgot to check myself for ticks. get ready and get to work. when i get back, my friend from back home calls and we're chatting away. i'm out back on the deck when i feel this pain shoot into my ribs. one of satan's henchmen is latched on to my ribs. as i said i've gotten a couple when i was a kid so i immediately knew what it was. i pry the tick off and toss it over the railing. i know i should have probably killed it but whatever. my friend and i stay on the phone cracking jokes about what just happened.

another 20 minutes go by still on the phone, us jersey folk can chat for hours. by now, i've wandered off into the woods quite a bit lollygagging away. suddenly i feel something on dick, my last words to my friend were: "i think there's a fucking tick on my peep! i gotta go." she starts cracking up, i hang up and start running full sprint to the house. i don't think i've ever been so focused on my own dick before. mid-stride and almost to the deck, i feel that shitpuppet dig in to my poor peep. the shock and pain almost took me to the ground. ran inside and dropped my jeans, and there it was. lucifers companion was having some lunch. i pulled thing off while it put up a fight. as soon as it detached, it felt like a molten rod was shoved up my peehole. with a stomach of blood from my dick, the tick was tossed into the fire.

the throbbing was horrible, and i decide to sooth it with some essiental oils. i knew it was gunna burn like shit but not this bad. i melted into the couch for hours while my peep was throbbing and still kinda burning. when i woke up tuesday morning, i didn't think i'd be making a blood scarifice to r'hllor.

always check for ticks kids.

    Here is the summary: : monday after rummaging through woods, i was too tired to check for ticks. tuesday morning once again i got forgot to check. later on, one of those dirty bastards made a meal out of my peep.

now on monday, i go off into the woods and do the usual but for some reason it really kicked my ass. exhausted afterwards, i go inside and throw myself on the couch. laying there i think to myself, "i gotta check for ticks." telling myself i'll to it later, i was too tired. the cat and dogs do every now and then. for me personally, i've never had a showdown with one of these bastards since i was probably 7. laying on the couch, i fall asleep.

tuesday comes, and i completely forgot to check myself for ticks. get ready and get to work. when i get back, my friend from back home calls and we're chatting away. i'm out back on the deck when i feel this pain shoot into my ribs. one of satan's henchmen is latched on to my ribs. as i said i've gotten a couple when i was a kid so i immediately knew what it was. i pry the tick off and toss it over the railing. i know i should have probably killed it but whatever. my friend and i stay on the phone cracking jokes about what just happened.

another 20 minutes go by still on the phone, us jersey folk can chat for hours. by now, i've wandered off into the woods quite a bit lollygagging away. suddenly i feel something on dick, my last words to my friend were: "i think there's a fucking tick on my peep! i gotta go." she starts cracking up, i hang up and start running full sprint to the house. i don't think i've ever been so focused on my own dick before. mid-stride and almost to the deck, i feel that shitpuppet dig in to my poor peep. the shock and pain almost took me to the ground. ran inside and dropped my jeans, and there it was. lucifers companion was having some lunch. i pulled thing off while it put up a fight. as soon as it detached, it felt like a molten rod was shoved up my peehole. with a stomach of blood from my dick, the tick was tossed into the fire.

the throbbing was horrible, and i decide to sooth it with some essiental oils. i knew it was gunna burn like shit but not this bad. i melted into the couch for hours while my peep was throbbing and still kinda burning. when i woke up tuesday morning, i didn't think i'd be making a blood scarifice to r'hllor.

always check for ticks kids.

    Here is the article: this actually took place over several days. i was working on a water sourced a/c unit last week and had to run new pvc pipe to the unit. after running the new pvc i left and let the glue cure until my co-worker could get back to run the unit a couple days later. he ran the unit and everything was fine, so he finished up for the day and left the a/c running. my boss calls me this morning and tells me i need to get over there now, the owner called and said the place was flooded. i went there as quick as i could and there is about a foot of water in 2 seperate rooms, both of which were being used to store all materials and tools. the owner lost every spare piece of dry wall he had, several pieces of plywood, and some doors, idk how much it all cost him but i would guess a couple thousand dollars. it took us 6 hours to get rid of all the water and all the bad material and afterward found out that when the water level was high enough to go into the bathrooms the water started going down the floor drains preventing the water from going any higher.  after the clean up we did some investigating and found a pvc fitting to the water sourced a/c unit that me and my boss put together wasnt glued properly and broke loose and poured out water for nearly 2 days.

    Here is the summary: me and my boss messed up on our job, water pumped out freely for nearly 2 days and flooded the building with about a foot of water. owner lost a couple thousand dollars. bathroom floor drains saved the situation from becoming worse.

    Here is the article: younger kid has been asking for a basketball hoop for a while, so i finally bit the bullet and got one. 54" board, 10 feet high - the whole deal. in this model the pole extends forward at an angle, so you don't slam into it when you are trying to dunk a ball. as a result, the assembly is kind of tipsy without the weight in the base.

got so excited after finally assembling it and eager to try, i only partially filled the base with water while figuring out the best place to put it on a driveway (it's heavy as fuck to roll around).

saturday was fun and games, and today was easter, so i totally forgot to fully fill the base. rain storm came in the afternoon with wind gusts, and the whole fucking thing came crashing down right onto my wife's car straight through the windshield.

ffffuuu. that's $450 out of the pocket for starters, but the worst part is, the earliest appointment at the glass shop is in two weeks. will be calling them in the morning to see if they have any cancellations so i get the car in.

wife is upset, i feel like a complete retard, which i am.

    Here is the summary: did not add weight to the basketball hoop and it crashed through the windshield of my wife's car.

    You will be given one summary written for a news article. Your task is to rate the summary based on the following criteria:
    Output format: PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE

    Evaluation Criteria:
    1. Read the news article carefully and identify the main topic and key points.
    2. Read the summary and compare it to the news article. Check if the summary covers the main topic and key points of the news article, and if it resents them in a clear and logical order.
    3. Rate the summary with 5 percentages, where each one represents how likely the summary is going to get a score from 1 to 5. For example, if you think the summary is 80% likely to get a score of 5, 10% likely to get a score of 4, 5% likely to get a score of 3, 3% likely to get a score of 2, and 1% likely to get a score of 1, you should rate the summary as 80, 10, 5, 3, 2.

    Here is the article: younger kid has been asking for a basketball hoop for a while, so i finally bit the bullet and got one. 54" board, 10 feet high - the whole deal. in this model the pole extends forward at an angle, so you don't slam into it when you are trying to dunk a ball. as a result, the assembly is kind of tipsy without the weight in the base.

    Here is the article: as goes with 99% of posts here, this fuckup happened several years ago, in the summer between 7th and 8th grades. three of my friends and i decided to go to a 3 week long session of summer camp in central texas. one of the other three kids and i were in one cabin, while his twin brother and our other friend were in a different cabin. the place had some fun activities, but shitty food, decrepit bathrooms, and living in temperatures ranging from 85-110 at all times of day made the experience less enjoyable than we expected. anyway, getting to the important story here.

at the camp, a lot of guys used to play a version of truth or dare using playing cards. essentially, someone would come up with a dare for the people playing, usually in your cabin, and anyone who wanted to play would get dealt one card. whoever had the lowest card would have to do the dare or face getting five-stared (slapped hard on the back) by the rest of the players. you didn't have to participate, but being new kids we didn't want to feel left out so we decided to give it a try. the game started off fairly mundane at  first, but we quickly noticed that dares were becoming more and more crazy by the round. one kid had to crawl all the way around the cabin on the unfinished wood floor naked, another had to sit bare-ass on another kid's chest for a minute, and i ended up having to taste my own piss. honestly the kids at the camp were a little off, but my friend and i decided to keep playing because a. watching people do humiliating things was funny b. we were also a little off.  

thinking of dares for the next round, someone shouted out that the person with the lowest card should have to rub the highest card kid's balls for 10 seconds. the game had just moved to a whole new level, but everyone in the cabin continued to play. when we flipped our cards, i realized my friend (we'll call him matt) had the highest card. he looked sick to his stomach as the rest of the cabin looked to him. despite his extreme discomfort, matt was too scared of getting five-stared by 10 people to forego the dare. so matt, my 7th grade straight friend who had never had a sexual interaction before, let the lowest-card guy rub his balls for 10 seconds. 

somehow after all of this, the cabin collectively decided to play another round. even my friend, for reasons i cannot possibly fathom, stayed in. the next dare suggested managed to one up the last one in terms of fucked up-ness - to give high card guy a footjob. cards were dealt, and we all sat nervously waiting for the flip. at this point, none of us even knew why we were playing anymore. then everyone flipped their cards, and to my utter astonishment, matt had the lowest card. my friend was now obligated to give the new high card kid a footjob for 10 seconds. matt had surpassed the threshold of what he could handle, and he began to break down in tears, pleading not to do the dare. but our cabin mates cornered him and said that if he broke the rules, he'd have the red marks of their hands on his back for the rest of the week. i was still standing in the center of the cabin, mouth agape, feeling so so bad for my friend. i knew having to do this would leave him emotionally scarred. i didn't know what to do, but i knew i had to do something. so i told the cabin i would do it for him. to clarify, this wasn't like a footjob you're probably thinking of - i closed my eyes and, with one foot proceeded to lightly kick around the other kids balls for 10 seconds, and he was not aroused at all. however, it was still obviously a very disgusting thing for me to have to do as a straight guy. i didn't feel great at all afterwords, but matt's ample private thanks made me feel like i had done the right thing. the story could've ended here, but this is why it was such a extreme fuckup.

instead of keeping what had happened that day a secret like we had discussed, matt decided to tell his twin brother and our other friend about what had happened. who proceeded to tell their friends when we went back to school in august. who told their friends, and eventually the whole grade. but it went even further than that; by the fall most of the middle school, some high schoolers, and even some fucking teachers had heard about what happened. i was literally the butt of every joke for the rest of middle school and early high school. i'm currently a junior and still get people coming up to me asking me if i am the guy who gave a kid a footjob. and here's the icing on the fucking cake - my friend, matt, conveniently left out why i did what i did, or what he had to do just one dare before. i've had to recount the story from my perspective hundreds of times just so people won't think i'm 100% fucked up.

    Here is the article: so imagine me, at midnight last night, and i find a loose thread on my favorite pair of army issue briefs. we've been through a lot together, you know. i gently pull on the thread and my wife immediately tells me, "don't do that, it'll keep coming out and you'll ruin them!"

too easy. my training has prepared me for this. i go to my desk and get a lighter. i'm going to burn the shit off. smiling to myself, i apply flame to the string and it makes a satisfying snap as it separates from the waistband of the briefs.

here's where i fuck up. you see, these briefs were still on my body. elastic burns, sure, but it doesn't stop. the next thing i know there is a damn bonfire on my hip, dangerously close to a valuable appendage, and the fire is growing. i'm on fire. images of emergency rooms are flashing through my brain like bright flashes of light. the fire is growing.

not really knowing what else to do, i bellow out a loud battle cry and smash my hand down onto the flame and hold it there to smother the blaze. the fire subsides, but now there's molten plastic stuck to my hip. my palm hurts, probably because of, you know, the fire.

now my hip has a reminder of how much i fucked up, and i should probably find some cream or some shit.

    Here is the article: obligatory "this didn't actually happen today". 
for real this happened yesterday while i was on my way to class. i have to take a tram to get there and it's usually pretty straightforward with nothing special going on, but yesterday i got on the tram and a couple of stops later a slightly chubby girl gets on. i don't think much of it,  but as she goes past me i start to notice a very very foul odor. she wasn't the only person that walked by so i didn't immediately think it was her. fast forward about 15-20 minutes or so and i have a massive head splitting headache from the smell in the tram. i start to feel like i'm going to vomit my guts out, but luckily i get off on the next stop. as i approach the door the chubby girl comes next to me and i immediately figured out it's her and i rush to the metro (subway) station. i catch the first train and lose her for good. 
now when i said the smell was really bad i mean really really really bad, corpse filled  with shit bad. my headache was getting worse and worse, and when i got out of the metro i was feeling pretty lightheaded.  i felt like i was drunk and couldn't pay attention to my surroundings and as i was crossing the street i ran into one of those sidewalk poles that prevent cars from. parking on then. they are just the right height to hit me in the nuts, and because it rained the day before the sidewalk was extremely slippery. so i hit the pole with my balls, slip on the sidewalk and literally "plank" on the pole while my entire body weight presses on my balls, the pole didn't even have the plastic cap on, so i was pretty much grinding my nuts on a sharp metal tube. needless to day me nuts and dick were sore for the next 2 hours.

    Here is the summary: bad smell on tram gave me a headache and i walked into a sidewalk pole smashing my nuts for a few seconds.

    Here is the article: so i met up with a horny lady friend on the interwebs. house is occupied so we decided that it was all fine to fuck in my coupe vehicle. we shared some bubbles and then went at it on the passenger seat. things started to get so hot that i had to open the door, as the car was full of condensation and such. damn car makes a beeping noise when the doors open and the keys are in the ignition, so i switched the key to the accessory position - didn't think much of it. bucket loads of sweat was extracted all over each other, dripping into the seatback.

later that evening after dropping her off, i noticed the srs light on my dash. damn, must have shaken the car too much and tripped the incident meter. i googled around and contacted the local specialist to visit me the following day while at work to sort it out.

well, today he turned up and hooked his computer into my dash. 
him: "hmm... looks like theres a reported fault with the sensor". 
me: "oh, yeah. damn thing's played up in the past. what's it say?"
him: "it's reporting a fault with the sensor in the passenger seat."
me" "um... yeah i was moving some stuff in my car in the weekend".
him: "oh, it says here the liquid submersion indicators were set off. did you get the seats wet?"
me: *blushing* "um... yeah i also cleaned my car. perhaps i wet the seat. ooops.".

$80 later and he's reset my system, and told me that in the future if i'm moving things about or cleaning to turn my ignition off to not trip the sensors.

    Here is the summary: if you're going to fuck in your modern srs-equipped car, turn the ignition off or you're going to have a bad time. or fuck on the back seats.

    Here is the article: first post and obligatory this didn't happen today....

about 10 years ago when i was in secondary school (high school for our american friends) i worked with a builder to make money for myself. it was a great job and i really enjoyed it. one fine saturday morning i turned up for work in a ridiculously hungover state. i was at a party for a friend of mine the night before and was absolutely wasted. in hindsight i probably shouldn't have gone into work but i didn't want to seem like a lazy slacker so got up and showed up. that day we were working in an old monastery where we were renovating certain parts of it.

my boss could tell straight away that i was very hungover and wasn't going to be of much use for the day. he's a very sound guy though and just gave me some very easy jobs to do. after about 2 hours he called me over to him and asked me to get a rusty old nut and bolt out of a roof-tile because he needed it. i looked at him and thought "jesus i know i'm hungover but this is pretty fucking basic". 

anyway being the stupid, hungover fool that i was i walked outside with the roof-tile in my hand and smashed it off the ground. pleased with myself i picked up the rusty nut and bolt and brought it back to my boss. i showed it to him proudly but wondered at the look of confusion on his face. he then asked me how i had managed to get the nut and bolt out as he himself had been unable to open them up even with his tools. i said sure it was easy when i broke the roof-tile. then his face dropped. turns out.... yes you guessed it.... he wanted the roof-tile and not the redundant nut and bolt. in fact it was one of the original roof-tiles from the monastery (which was a protected historical structure). my hangover suddenly vanished when he explained that there were very few places in the world that made these and i was going to have to pay for the expensive replacement! i never showed up drunk to work after that day, just got lazy and took the day off!!

    Here is the article: so this happened a few weeks ago. i was introduced to a girl via one of my friends when we all went to watch a movie together. she gave me her number that evening and we started texting to get to know each other since we didn't get to talk much after the movie. but the more i texted her the more clear it became to me that she's not the girl for me at all. she had completely different interests and some of the things she said annoyed me a little as well. so after about a week of texting and getting to know her, i decided to tone it down a bit but she wouldn't stop. even if i didn't reply she would text me continuously till i felt obligated to reply. this went on for a couple of days. i finally decided to tell her that i am not interested in anything more than just being friends in a very descent way because she was my friends friend. here comes the fuck up.
i texted her this lengthy text which started with *"hey! look i know we've known each other only for a short time but i really don't think i am the right kinda guy for you........... blah blah!"* and hit send. something made me re-read the text and when i did so, i fucking flipped. i had missed the word **"don't"**. my phone/brain trolled the shit out of me. i didn't know what to do and now she thinks i actually asked her to be her boyfriend in a subtle way. i told my friend and she was so mad but couldn't stop laughing at my misery. 

 

**update**
i think the universe is trying to punish me for something i did in the past.

after talking to my friend about this and she telling me to grow some balls and come clear with this girl i texted her and asked her to meet me outside if she was free. i didn't want to do this over a text again. she said she would be free around dinner time. so i suggested a restaurant close to my place since i wasn't in the mood to drive far and we agreed to meet there at 8pm. i was there a little early so decided to go in and grab a drink (you know, to loosen myself a bit for the worst). she was 20 min late but when she arrived she was all dressed up and looked hot. i was taken aback as i was super underdressed compared to her. the first thing she tells me even before i could open my mouth was that "i think you can read my mind. this is my favorite restaurant.". i honestly considered running away. but then i mustered all the courage i had (after 5 rum and cokes) and told her about my blunder. she went quite and i was a bit scared. she then broke a glass and stormed off. in the end, she costed me, a dinner for two (which neither of us had but had ordered), and 7 drinks (she had 2) which is not too bad considering what an idiot i've been. i've learned my lesson, never to express your feelings over texts.

    Here is the article: so this happened a few weeks ago. i was introduced to a girl via one of my friends when we all went to watch a movie together. she gave me her number that evening and we started texting to get to know each other since we didn't get to talk much after the movie. but the more i texted her the more clear it became to me that she's not the girl for me at all. she had completely different interests and some of the things she said annoyed me a little as well. so after about a week of texting and getting to know her, i decided to tone it down a bit but she wouldn't stop. even if i didn't reply she would text me continuously till i felt obligated to reply. this went on for a couple of days. i finally decided to tell her that i am not interested in anything more than just being friends in a very descent way because she was my friends friend. here comes the fuck up.
i texted her this lengthy text which started with *"hey! look i know we've known each other only for a short time but i really don't think i am the right kinda guy for you........... blah blah!"* and hit send. something made me re-read the text and when i did so, i fucking flipped. i had missed the word **"don't"**. my phone/brain trolled the shit out of me. i didn't know what to do and now she thinks i actually asked her to be her boyfriend in a subtle way. i told my friend and she was so mad but couldn't stop laughing at my misery. 

 

**update**
i think the universe is trying to punish me for something i did in the past.

after talking to my friend about this and she telling me to grow some balls and come clear with this girl i texted her and asked her to meet me outside if she was free. i didn't want to do this over a text again. she said she would be free around dinner time. so i suggested a restaurant close to my place since i wasn't in the mood to drive far and we agreed to meet there at 8pm. i was there a little early so decided to go in and grab a drink (you know, to loosen myself a bit for the worst). she was 20 min late but when she arrived she was all dressed up and looked hot. i was taken aback as i was super underdressed compared to her. the first thing she tells me even before i could open my mouth was that "i think you can read my mind. this is my favorite restaurant.". i honestly considered running away. but then i mustered all the courage i had (after 5 rum and cokes) and told her about my blunder. she went quite and i was a bit scared. she then broke a glass and stormed off. in the end, she costed me, a dinner for two (which neither of us had but had ordered), and 7 drinks (she had 2) which is not too bad considering what an idiot i've been. i've learned my lesson, never to express your feelings over texts.

    Here is the article: it was the summer of 2016, euro 2016 was underway, and i am a die hard italy supporter. it was almost time for the quarter final match; italy vs spain. there was around 10 minutes left, and i was in the mood for ice cream, so i decided to go get ice cream and come back home, i didn't want to be late, so i decided that i would go running to ice cream shop, and i didn't want to waste time wearing shoes, so i went in slippers. 
my father told me not to run and not to go in slippers, i told him nothing is going to happen to me if i go in slippers. 
boy, was i wrong.
so i'm running, and all of a sudden i hear something running behind me, i turn around, and there's a huge dog. i'm terrified of dogs. i get extremely scared and start running as fast as i can, and then, i trip. my glasses fall down, my slipper rips, and my knee starts bleeding, and the dog just stands there next to me and barks. i got up and ran to the nearest store. i told him what happened, he began to playfully laugh, he then helped me find my glasses and slippers, and cleaned my knee.
so i continue walking to the ice cream shop even though my slipper is ripped, and when i arrive, the dog is fucking standing outside. 
there was no way i was going to get near it, i walked back home, with no ice cream, a ripped slipper, and a bloody knee. oh, and i missed the first 10 minutes of the match.

    Here is the article: before i begin, just a little bit of background story since this is more like a fifteen year long fuck up: more than a decade ago, a fifteen year old guy had a dream, to end the night no longer a virgin. the quest was glorious. 

somehow, a bunch of 15 year olds got their hands on a minivan and went bar hopping- attempting to get laid. 3 am the quest was deemed a failure, we went into a 7-11 to get some food before we got home. lo and behold parked right beside us were women. college women. slightly buzzed and more than willing to party. i guess in a storm of hormone powered confidence, i managed to pass myself off as a college guy, studying engineering.

 little did i know that the only reason why the girls gave us the time of day was that their gay friend who turned out to be their dealer had their eyes on us. basically at the end of it, we were offered this, you can fuck the girls but you've got to let me watch. it was shady as hell but heck i was horny as hell and at that point all the shits i had to give all went straight to my dick. so we went with them to the shadiest motel chain in the city. i got naked. got my first kiss. got my first blow job --- with somebody watching. and i was pretty sure with me being 15 and the creepy gay guy being much older it was very much illegal. anyway the moment of truth came, finally got to have sex. with an older college chick. who had much more experience. i lasted all of 30 seconds. and that destroyed pretty much all my confidence from there on out. 

so 15 years later, i returned to the very same motel room with a hooker. determined to somehow fuck my issues into oblivion... it seemed like a good idea at that time. it all started with an oil massage. it felt fantastic but somehow instead of getting relaxed i got more anxious. 

the moment came when i was supposed to go all alpha male and assume the dominant position. yeah, i was gonna do it. i looked down and i was limp as overcooked asparagus. she tried but nothing work. it was a death spiral of total failure. the harder she tried the more anxious i got... went straight from premature ejaculation to impotence. thing is i paid her anyway. not only did i have limp dick syndrome, i blew my budget for the week.

    Here is the summary: limp dick.

    Here is the article: **the lead-up:**
like all fun stories, it starts with a guy meeting a girl. after only a few months, we move in together due to, what i can only describe as, being completely compatible. after a year, things take a drastic turn for the worse. it seems like our entire relationship is built on a foundation of lies, perpetrated by her, in an effort to get me "hooked", so to speak. everything unravels, albeit, not completely and we continue an on again, off again relationship for 3 more years. finally the day comes where i've had enough and it's time to cut off all ties forever.
 
&nbsp;

**the fuck up:**
at this time she is living in my apartment (which i rent) and it is way out of her price range. i do the honorable thing and give her 90 days to find a new place to live. knowing her, i make sure to really cement in that this is a very firm deadline, and she will be leaving one way or another at the end of this grace period. she moves out of the bedroom, into the living room and we go about our regular routines. wanting to really ensure that she understands the gravity of this situation, and to prevent myself from falling back into old traps (which i had done so so many times before), i start to date someone new. everything at this point is going smoothly, she knows i'm dating someone whom i had a very strong connection with as a friend previously and my ex is dealing with it (not that she had much of a say in the matter).
 
&nbsp;

**the fallout:**
being as my apartment was quite hot in the summer, i liked to sleep in the nude. the bedroom is well cut off from the living room and i lock my door at night because, to be honest, i don't trust her (a story for another time). needless to say this night goes like any other, and i go to bed with my door locked. the next morning i wake up to chaos. my phone is blowing up with missed calls and texts from my new girlfriend. apparently, the night before she had been texted nude photos of me with my ex with a simple message "we are back together so fuck off". apparently my ex had broken into my room, went into my phone (stupidly, i did not lock it the night before), found her number and posed herself naked with me for a series of very incriminating photos.

For example, if you think the summary is 80% likely to get a score of 5, 10% likely to get a score of 4, 5% likely to get a score of 3, 3% likely to get a score of 2, and 1% likely to get a score of 1, you should rate the summary as 80, 10, 5, 3, 2.

    Here is the article: this happened to me this morning, and i'm still feeling the effects of the awkardness.

to give some background, i am now a senior in high school and have a semi-girlfriend (we've been together on and off for a while and are just sorta undefined rn to stay simple before college). i sing a lot, especially at a church which is a couple towns over. anyway, one of my friends from that town a couple months ago asked me to be her backup for her prom which i didn't think was a big deal, so i said okay after not checking my calendar or checking w the semi-gf. since then we've texted some, and recently it's become pretty clear that she's really into me.

fast forward to today. i had a rehearsal today and went to grab lunch with some of my choir friends. after we eat, the girl who i was a backup for said she thought some of her friends were there and wanted to say hi.  it seemed like they were a no-show, which led to some jokes about her not actually having friends, until they popped out wearing shirts that spelled "prom" with a poster, and she actually had a cute little pun-infused speech to ask me with. i was a bit too shell-shocked to think, said yes, posed for some pictures, thought everything was going swimmingly, and she was obviously elated that it all worked out.

thus i fucked up two-fold. i realized a little later that i wasn't going to be home the weekend of her prom. i was driving my friend home and we were talking about the whole thing when i checked my ical on my phone, and boom, the headline that i was going to be on a school trip that whole weekend, already paid for. i was immediately on defcon 1, freaking out uncontrollably, when i looked on instagram and saw her post of the two of us with already 100-something likes. this means that every one of her friends in this town that i wasn't from is now expecting me to show up to her prom while i'll be a couple hundred miles away (and they're all really excited for it). that will be a fun one for her to explain...

i saw her later that night for a service (easter vigil and whatnot), and generally tried to avoid bringing it up for as long as i could before i was forced into it, like making middle schoolers talk at a school dance. i tried to explain my mistake, that it was because the trip was going to be cancelled because the director didn't hire buses on time, that somehow it all got saved at the last second which i didn't expect, but it really didn't hide the fact that it was all my fault. the rest of the night was really awkward between me feeling like the worst type of person and her trying to cover up how upset she was.

finally, the second part of the fuck up was something i alluded to before: the part where i never told the sorta-gf anything about this. i went to her house to hang out after the service tonight. i didn't get there till about 9:45, and we just watched the basketball game, but the entire time she refused to sit near me or say anything or admit anything was wrong. got home and now there's a block text from her telling me off about how upset this all made her. i have a terrible track record with relationships already, so i think this is going to be a rocky recovery.

    Here is the summary: said yes to a proposal from a friend from out of town bc she didn't have a date, and i can't even attend and didn't tell my sorta-gf who is now pissed at me, and made my friend make a fool of herself on social media.

*something something* throwaway because family and friends on reddit *something something* didn't happen today.

a little bit of background; i'm a 15 year old girl who may or may not be addicted to masturbating ^dont ^^judge ^^^me ^^^^pls

so yesterday i was playing gta v on my laptop and since i find driving very difficult i used my brother's xbox one controller. as i was just fucking around in los santos, it was almost 11 pm and i realized i hadn't masturbated for several days now (gta v tends to do that). so i started doing the... ^um... ^^act... and, for whatever reason, it wasn't satisfying. so i did what my sleepy and horny brain told me and used my xbone controller down there.

i have never used or even seen a dildo or anything of the sorts before, but this is what i imagine it'd feel like.

now this is where the real fu starts. as i was doing the deed, my brother walked in. the one who owns the controller that was currently rubbing against my genitalia walked in.
he stood there, absolutely terrified, for a good minute without saying anything while i fumbled to cover myself up and kept apologizing to him.

the next day he bought me my own xbox 360 controller.

 

update: holy fucking shit this exploded ._. my own friends have been sending me the link to this post telling me how funny it is.

also til reddit is filled with pedophiles.

    Here is the summary: my brother is disappointed in me because his xbone controller was in me.

well, i get one dub of the stuff before my guy sells out maybe 3 months before this and is a long time coming before i see it again...well fast forward that 3 months and i finally get it again with the last 20 i had to spend. i was very excited. 

well i get this 20 bag when we first start hanging out this one cold saturday night. well this was at around 10 pm and we jump 3 1/2 hours later to 1 in the morning after a long night of smoking (his stuff because he has a lot and is nice as hell) and driving around. 

we end up 45 min north of my city meeting friends (1 of his, 1 of mine) who wanted some ganja. we decided to meet in the trailer park where a friend of my guy lives. my guy gave me the stuff to give to my friend for the sac they wanted and i unconsciously put it in the same pocket as my dub sac....

so after we conclude our business, i finally decide now is the time to crack open that fresh dub and smoke a bowl on the long ride home. well i can't find it.............shit. i looked everywhere, and i mean everywhere for that dub and couldn't find it. i then text my friend asking if i gave her two bags when we did that business. "yes, why?"...my heart sunk. i don't even know how i didn't notice me grabbing 2 bags out of my pocket....the last 20 i had for weed until pay day was gone and i didn't even get to smoke any of it..and this is one of the only buds i actively asked for. it was not a happy rest of the ride home where i just passed out upon arrival..

    Here is the summary: bought super good bud one time. didn't see it for 3 months. bought dub of it with last 20 till pay day. gave it to friend along with their sac by mistake. was very sad after

    Here is the article: so it wasn't exactly today, but it was 2 weeks ago today. little backstory, i am a major stoner (smoke the good good every day), and i have grown to be pretty tolerant to all non chronic bud. needless to say, when i find i bud that gets me gone, i'm going to want more of it.

well, i get one dub of the stuff before my guy sells out maybe 3 months before this and is a long time coming before i see it again...well fast forward that 3 months and i finally get it again with the last 20 i had to spend. i was very excited. 

well i get this 20 bag when we first start hanging out this one cold saturday night. well this was at around 10 pm and we jump 3 1/2 hours later to 1 in the morning after a long night of smoking (his stuff because he has a lot and is nice as hell) and driving around. 

we end up 45 min north of my city meeting friends (1 of his, 1 of mine) who wanted some ganja. we decided to meet in the trailer park where a friend of my guy lives. my guy gave me the stuff to give to my friend for the sac they wanted and i unconsciously put it in the same pocket as my dub sac....

so after we conclude our business, i finally decide now is the time to crack open that fresh dub and smoke a bowl on the long ride home. well i can't find it.............shit. i looked everywhere, and i mean everywhere for that dub and couldn't find it. i then text my friend asking if i gave her two bags when we did that business. "yes, why?"...my heart sunk. i don't even know how i didn't notice me grabbing 2 bags out of my pocket....the last 20 i had for weed until pay day was gone and i didn't even get to smoke any of it..and this is one of the only buds i actively asked for. it was not a happy rest of the ride home where i just passed out upon arrival..

    Here is the summary: I was very excited to get my hands on this rare strain of weed again.

    Here is the article: apologize for length. and, as bad as this is, it actually turned out to be a turning point in my life, and i'll  get to that later.

this was in 2015. some friends of mine were celebrating their anniversary at this nice restaurant with different function rooms, inside a hotel. i didn't know too many other people there, so i started slamming down drinks and having some fun.

i started getting a little tired after a while, so i sat down in this separate lounge area otuside the function halls, and wound up falling asleep. i have no idea how long i slept, but i was really embarrassed for falling asleep like that. so i briskly tried to shake it off, and went back into the function room, not paying attention to what room i was going into.

back in the room, the crowd was way more lively, and the music was different - kind of ethnic sounding. instead of questioning this, i just thought to myself "huh, things really picked up!" and headed for the bar. i started knocking back a crazy amount of alcohol, and started flirting with the ladies at the bar. things were really hopping at this point. i started talking to the girl next to me. i asked "how do you know dave and karen?" (the couple celebrating their anniversary). she looked at me kind of funny, and after asking again, she replied in a thick european accent "oh, he's my little cousin." i briefly thought to myself, huh, that's weird. dave's 40, and this gal is like 26 or so. weird that she'd call dave her "little cousin".

she starts getting a little nervous, and points to a guy in the corner and says to me "see him? that's brad."

now i'm thinking, brad? why the fuck do i care who brad is? so i'm thinking brad must be her ex-boyfriend or something, so i take her our to the dance floor and start dancing with her. she obliges, and we dance for a bit. because i'm an arrogant prick, i decided, hey, why don't i rub it in brad's face that i'm dancing with his girl? so i start waving to brad while i'm trying to grind with her - and started flapping at her ass like i was pretending to slap it and making dick waving motions. and what do you know, brad sees me and starts marching over. she grabs me by the arm and says "are you crazy! that's brad!" -- then it hit's me. she's not saying "brad" she's saying it's her "dad".

it's at this point, i went cold, looked around, and realized i was at the wrong fucking party. i darted out the door, realizing the sign in the entryway for that room said "happy birthday (foreign name)". i ask the guy at hotel desk, and he says it's an albanian kid's birthday party. my friend's anniversary party finished cleaning up over an hour ago in the room next to it. 

i got the fuck out of there, and made for the parking lot. as i'm getting into my car, "brad" and another guy come running after me and yank me out of the car. i tried putting my hands up and apologizing, but "brad" squarely hit me in the gut, and handed my ass to me. after giving me a quick boxing lesson, he tosses me back in the car, and (thank god) walks away. there's no way i was driving like that, so i moved my car to a nearby lot, and called for a cab home.

i woke up the next day looking like i got mauled by wild animals. and at that point, i realized i'm on the verge of a bad alcohol problem, and started sobriety that week. it was easily one of the shittiest experiences of my life, but at least i got something out of it.

    Here is the summary: went to a friend's anniversary, slept through the entire party, woke up at an albanian kid's birthday happening at the same place, proceeded to piss off a bunch of albanians by disrespecting a young lady, got beaten up.

    Here is the article: this happened years ago when i was about 17 or 18 years old.
me and some friends were having a small get together at my house and among the group were some girls we liked. so we're out by the pool having a drink, talking and taking a swim.
so my best friend joe at this stage is very into the one girl, and him being smooth as fuck doesn't have any problem getting the girls to like him (you know, the straight and forward type and taking everything in his stride).
so this girl's sister (lets call her mary) is there as well, quite the hottie and she never gives off this vibe that she's stuck up or anything.

anyways, so joe tells mary offhand that i'm into her, just so she knows (he used to do shit like this without telling me or whoever he was "doing a favor" about it).
after that, not having a bikini there, mary asks me if she can borrow one of my shorts to take a swim in. i'm like, sure, lets go see what we can find.
she follows me into the house and into my room, i choose some shorts i probally wore years ago that would fit her if she tightens the strings a bit.
she starts taking off her clothes right there and then. first her top, and then wriggles out of her tight as hell jeans. so by now she is standing there in only her bra and panties, and starts taking her bra off. the whole package i'm seeing is just ... wow. being a total idiot and not sure what to do, i thought that she is just very comfortable with shit like that (getting undressed in front of other people).
my only thought of action then was to leave the room to give her some privacy rather than gawk at her like some creep.

i walked outside and told joe what just happened. he said he told mary that i like her and she said she had her eye on me too. he forgot to tell me this exchange of words.

mary eventually comes out of the house and just looks totally confused and i feel so embarrassed for totally messing up the signals.

    Here is the summary: girl gives clear cut signals, im too dumb to read them

(she truly believed the kid did this she didn't try to cover for me) she goes "omg did the poor thing run into a wall"? i take a second to process it before assuring he that is what he did. a manager then told me later on "hey don't worry about it, there's kid running around here all the time, it happens". still don't know if he knew what truly happened or not. i spent the rest of the buffet on edge trying not to bump into people.

    Here is the summary: I was at a buffet celebrating Mother's Day when I accidentally collided with a toddler and he went headfirst into a solid wood wall.

    Here is the article: this actually just happened tonight, and it's a double fuck up, so stay with me! a group of friends and i (3 guys, and 3 girls whom we had just met last weekend) went out to a sports bar to watch college football. we ordered some caribbean jerk buffalo wings and they were absolutely amazing. super spicy, but also sweet. i ate 20 of them to myself! not only were the wings great, but  me and the other two guys were getting along with the girls really well! we were making them laugh a lot, and they were being very flirtatious. i lost count of all the sexual innuendos that were made! unfortunately, i had been experimenting with a gluten free diet for the past 3 weeks. i was unaware of the fiery hell that awaited me when the wings digested.

**part 1**
at first it was just a normal feeling of having to poop, so i excused myself and went to the bathroom. i wasn't able to get anything out the first time, so i went back to the table. a few minutes later, the pressure in my stomach came back. i didn't want to go to the bathroom a 2nd time in front of the females, so i tried to wait it out. after another 5 minutes passed the pain had increased so much that i was concerned my abdomen would explode! i quitely excused myself again and ran to the bathroom. i'd never truly understood explosive diarrhea until tonight! the second i sat down, piles and piles of shit violently exited my asshole. the worst part is that the wings were super spicy, which made it feel like my asshole was an uncontrollable flame thrower. after it was all over, i went back to my table. it turns out the girl who i thought i'd be able to bring back home knew exactly what was going on, and left without even telling me!

**part 2**
once the game was over i started driving back home when all of a sudden round two kicked in. i almost had to pull over because i feared i wouldn't be able to hold all of it in for the 10 minute drive home! as soon as i got back, the hoover damn exploded. it was literally liquid. lucky for me, that was the last of it, and i felt much better. since i wasn't able to make sexy time with the girl, i decided to jerk off. it turns out i didn't quite get all the sauce off my fingers. my dick was on fire for an entire half an hour, and still burned mildly for another hour after that!

from this point onward, i will never eat gluten again.

    Here is the summary: got cock blocked by buffalo wings, which also made my dick burn

    Here is the article: so in light of my last tifu, i brought my father and stepmother to the therapist with me. he suggested finding a fun game to bond the entire family with, and my dad shipped his old pool table to the house today while i was at school. anyways, me my stepbrother and little brother where all very excited to play pool and immediately started playing cut throat. 

there was one small issue however, i had never played pool in my entire life. i absolutely sucked at hitting it. my problem was that every time i hit the ball for some reason it chipped in the air. 

my dad came in, and saw that i was chipping it every time and got slightly upset because there are windows in the room. he told me not to chip it unless i had to in order to hit a ball in. 

here is where the fuckup happens. i am a 15 year old male teen, which is probably why i reacted the way i did. instead of explaining to him how to hit the ball, i was embarassed to suck so much and told my father i was only doing it because i saw professionals do it on youtube. this made him more upset and told me not to chip it any more because it is dangerous. i agree and let my stepbrother have his turn. 

my stepbrother failed to accurately call his shot, so again it was my turn. i chipped it again on accident. my dad was erring on the side of anger, so i let my stepbrother go again even though i hit the ball i called in with the chip. he missed and it was my turn again, and yet again i chipped it. 

now my dad has banned me from every playing pool and im too embarassed to tell him why i was chipping it still.

    Here is the summary: suck at pool, accidently chip too much, banned from the table by dad for "reckless behavior".

    Here is the article: this didn't happen today, but sunday night. 

i had been visiting one of my in-laws, who is currently still in critical condition at a local hospital and...well, he's in bad shape. it has taken a huge toll on the family to see him wither away week by week. on sunday, we were told that his condition (congestive heart failure) was only getting worse and that there was no way for him to be released from the hospital. he's going to die there. 

of course, i had to deal with sobbing family members and a fuckton of stress and sadness rising within me. my wife decided to stay with her bedridden father overnight and told me that she'd be okay with me leaving to go home and feed the dogs. i planned on coming back in the morning.

as i'm taking the elevator up to the third floor of the parking garage where i parked my car, all that i was thinking is, "i can't wait to get drunk and watch cartoons." in the relative darkness, with no one around, i also realized that i finally had a chance to just let go and i started crying.

on the third floor, i spotted *my car* (more on this later) in the distance. the only person on the whole third floor was this short teenager wearing what looked like a beanie to cover his face. he was walking very slowly, almost as if he were exaggerating his slowness, and he had what i thought were tattered clothes and "douche-y" long hair sticking out from underneath the beanie. i thought, "oh great, i'm going to get mugged," but the kid just walked slowly toward my car and didn't even notice me approaching.

my heart started racing. i was still crying, but i picked up my pace and eventually started running toward him. the kid reached down toward the driver's side door and opened it. at that point, i was in a complete panic. *this fucker is going to steal my car!* 

i started flailing my arms and screaming "stop!" along with a rainbow of obscenities. i wanted to grab that kid and toss him over the edge of the building.

and then, maybe ten feet away from the kid, who was settling into the driver's seat slowly and turning to see what the commotion was about, i made a heart-rending realization:  "this isn't where i parked my car."

now that i was closer, i looked at the "kid." it wasn't a kid---it was a short, old lady.

i ran away as fast as i could, found my car, and floored it out of there. and, at home, i did get drunk after all.

looking back at this, i'm laughing at how absurd it all was (it reminds me of the movie *die hard* for some reason), but i still feel like a dick. i just hope that the lady didn't even notice that i was talking to her.

    Here is the summary: i'm a shitstain.

on the third floor, i spotted *my car* (more on this later) in the distance. the only person on the whole third floor was this short teenager wearing what looked like a beanie to cover his face. he was walking very slowly, almost as if he were exaggerating his slowness, and he had what i thought were tattered clothes and "douche-y" long hair sticking out from underneath the beanie. i thought, "oh great, i'm going to get mugged," but the kid just walked slowly toward my car and didn't even notice me approaching.

my heart started racing. i was still crying, but i picked up my pace and eventually started running toward him. the kid reached down toward the driver's side door and opened it. at that point, i was in a complete panic. *this fucker is going to steal my car!* 

i started flailing my arms and screaming "stop!" along with a rainbow of obscenities. i wanted to grab that kid and toss him over the edge of the building.

and then, maybe ten feet away from the kid, who was settling into the driver's seat slowly and turning to see what the commotion was about, i made a heart-rending realization:  "this isn't where i parked my car."

now that i was closer, i looked at the "kid." it wasn't a kid---it was a short, old lady.

i ran away as fast as i could, found my car, and floored it out of there. and, at home, i did get drunk after all.

looking back at this, i'm laughing at how absurd it all was (it reminds me of the movie *die hard* for some reason), but i still feel like a dick. i just hope that the lady didn't even notice that i was talking to her.

    Here is the summary: I had been visiting one of my in-laws, who is currently still in critical condition at a local hospital and...well, he's in bad shape.

    You will be given one summary written for a news article. Your task is to rate the summary based on the following criteria:
    Output format: PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE

    Evaluation Criteria:
    1. Read the news article carefully and identify the main topic and key points.
    2. Read the summary and compare it to the news article. Check if the summary covers the main topic and key points of the news article, and if it resents them in a clear and logical order.
    3. Rate the summary with 5 percentages, where each one represents how likely the summary is going to get a score from 1 to 5. For example, if you think the summary is 80% likely to get a score of 5, 10% likely to get a score of 4, 5% likely to get a score of 3, 3% likely to get a score of 2, and 1% likely to get a score of 1, you should rate the summary as 80, 10, 5, 3, 2.

    Here is the article: this didn't happen today, but sunday night. 

i had been visiting one of my in-laws, who is currently still in critical condition at a local hospital and...well, he's in bad shape. it has taken a huge toll on the family to see him wither away week by week. on sunday, we were told that his condition (congestive heart failure) was only getting worse and that there was no way for him to be released from the hospital. he's going to die there. 

of course, i had to deal with sobbing family members and a fuckton of stress and sadness rising within me. my wife decided to stay with her bedridden father overnight and told me that she'd be okay with me leaving to go home and feed the dogs. i planned on coming back in the morning.

    Here is the summary: I went to the carnival with my friend on my birthday.

    Here is the article: this is a throwaway because almost all of my friends check my real reddit a lot. 

this happened several days ago, and i still feel like a retarded dumbass. i had joined some high school fashion show and it required you to come to these practices every week. they are over two hours long so most everyone sits and talks somewhere in the school until your group is called.

i was sittimg with some friends just joking around on the benches with some girls who we also knew. one of them was extremely hot. i remember cracking a joke or something and then "sarah" said her parents were in other country and asked if i wanted to come over. i was sure it was a joke as she was basically telling me she wanted to have sex. i laughed it off and we continued hanging out.

so it sounds like she was joking? about a half hour later she makes the same comment towards me. hmm...maybe she thinks i'm some sort of scrublord who would fall for some cruel joke in front of everyone? i went along with it and said "yeah," but not in some shy way...kinda playful. 

she and some other kids go to get food while they are waiting for their role. i sit with the last few kids and we just chill. 

so she comes back and when she is coming down the hallway she makes the same comment. third time. i kid you not she askes me what i was doing after the practice and how her parents were gone and that she wanted me to come over (for sex). 

it was not until a few hours ago that i put some thought into the whole thing.

    Here is the summary: hot girl basically asked me for sex three times in one night. i thought she was joking and now wondering what would have happened if i showed more interest.

    Here is the article: a little background for everyone. i have an extensive medical background as a patient, and at one point i had access to about any drug i could imagine. i get very anxious in certain situations (especially medical situations) so i have a prescription for ativan.

so last night, i decided that i wanted to ask out a new girl at school, but the catch is that i am a pussy. so i thought "hey, some ativan would calm my nerves and maybe i can break the ice without looking like an ass?"

after my thought, i subsequently went searching for my drugs, and i could not find them anywhere. i looked high, i looked low, but the stuff alluded me. i even looked in my dogs medications to see if somehow it got mixed up in there. this is where the fuck up comes into play. 

since i want to be a medical student, i know a lot about pharmaceuticals and chemistry (apparently not enough), and i happened to find a bottle in my dog's meds labeled alprazolam, which is the generic form of xanax. knowing that this was just a different kind of benzo (all i knew is that it had a shorter half life in the body), i decided it would be fine to take it. (however; before i go any farther i would like to stress that **i know that the anti anxiety pills issued to animals and humans are the exact same** at least in this instance. just so no one calls me a dumb ass. also another side note, **i was only trying to use the medicine as prescribed**). so i grabbed 2mg and i was headed on my way.

two hours later, i am sitting in class, and knowing that it takes a little while to kick in, i decide to take the 2mg which is my normal dose of ativan...this was a horrible idea. in about 20 minutes i started to feel a bit weird, and then it hit me like a fucking brick. it felt like i was just shot out of a cannon, and skyrocketing towards the clouds. i started to make weird muffled noises, and odd movements. thankfully, it was the end of that class, but i was then promptly thrown into the hall way, which was another realm in itself to a tripped out minerdodec. despite the fact that i am 6' 3", everyone seemed so tall, and i felt like i was in a jungle of moving tress like in lotr. 

i finally made it to my lunch table, and proceeded to inquire if i looked like i was high. the consensus was no, but at this point i was back in the sky and nearly fell out of my lunch table. for the rest of the lunch i was sitting around tripped out and then i finally realized why i took the stuff in the first place; to ask the girl out. so then i went out and started searching, until i finally found her and started to go up. at this point, i was starting to come down, but it wasn't enough for me to be normal. i proceed to go up to her, she sees me, and i put my finger up and open my mouth like i was about to say something to her. then i just totally fucking blank out. everything that i was previously thinking just was wiped from my mind. after about ten seconds of me just standing there and thinking profusely, i just said "yep.", and did a 180 and walked away. guess today wasn't my day for that...

i did learn something medical from it though. little did i know that xanax is almost twice as potent as ativan. this also coupled with the fact that i hadn't ever taken xanax , or a benzo in a year (making my tolerance an absolute zero) most likely explains why i was high.

    Here is the summary: : was nervous about asking a girl out, couldn't find my ativan, took my dogs xanax instead, accidentally tripped the fuck out in school, made myself look like an idiot in front of girl while tripping

i finally made it to my lunch table, and proceeded to inquire if i looked like i was high. the consensus was no, but at this point i was back in the sky and nearly fell out of my lunch table. for the rest of the lunch i was sitting around tripped out and then i finally realized why i took the stuff in the first place; to ask the girl out. so then i went out and started searching, until i finally found her and started to go up. at this point, i was starting to come down, but it wasn't enough for me to be normal. i proceed to go up to her, she sees me, and i put my finger up and open my mouth like i was about to say something to her. then i just totally fucking blank out. everything that i was previously thinking just was wiped from my mind. after about ten seconds of me just standing there and thinking profusely, i just said "yep.", and did a 180 and walked away. guess today wasn't my day for that...

i did learn something medical from it though. little did i know that xanax is almost twice as potent as ativan. this also coupled with the fact that i hadn't ever taken xanax , or a benzo in a year (making my tolerance an absolute zero) most likely explains why i was high.

    Here is the summary: I had a prescription for ativan, but i couldn't find it.

For example, if you think the summary is 80% likely to get a score of 5, 10% likely to get a score of 4, 5% likely to get a score of 3, 3% likely to get a score of 2, and 1% likely to get a score of 1, you should rate the summary as 80, 10, 5, 3, 2.

    Here is the article: so this fuck up is currently happening, as i am sitting here trying to figure out what to do. so i thought reddit might enjoy my sorrow. 

it all really started in october when i became an a/v technician for a convention center. the company i work for is in house, but we send some of the employees out to different locations that are contracted with the company if they need help. this one particular place that i've been sent is a hotel in the mountains about an hour and a half drive from where i live. i was sent here today to cover for the only technician (who is also the a/v director) on site, so i took the shift and started my day. 

now, i really enjoy this job, and for the work i do, it's totally worth the drive to get paid what i get paid. i've come to this location 3 times before and was taught the ins and outs of what goes on. i know the property pretty well and have had no problems with the management before. every time i drive into the property, i have to park on the side near the loading dock, because i do not have a key to access the employee garage. the technician who i was covering for always told me that i could park at the loading dock, because of my inability to enter the garage. 

so i've parked in the same spot i've parked before, enter the hotel, set up for the conference that was going on inside, and went to the staff office and sat at the a/v directors desk. fast forward 4 hours, and i'm still at the desk waiting for this conference to get done so i can strike the room. i hadn't taken lunch and was feeling a little hungry, so i decided i go on my lunch break to grab some five guys down the street. so i walk outside to my car and bam. it's gone.

oh shit.

i asked the guy who is in charge of shipments at the loading dock what happened.

"hey man, do you know what happened to my car? it was right outside."

"oh shit, that was yours?"

"yeah did it get towed?!" 

"yeah man, oh my god i'm so sorry. we called around the whole property to see if we could find whose it was, but no one knew."

are you fucking serious? the whole property? i couldn't believe it. my car got towed by the hotel i'm doing work for. no one even bothered to ask if it was my car. and i was sitting at that desk for hours. the loading dock guy tells me to talk to the hotel director, and to the sales guy on property with my company. so i get down to the lobby and talk to the hotel director.

"hey you guys had my car towed, can you at least help me get it back?"

"the hotel will not take responsibility for your car being towed. it was parked illegally near the dock."

"first off, not illegally, that's where i've been told to park every time i come here."

"well it's still not our responsibility. you work with an outside a/v company and should have parked in the garage." 

"yeah well you guys literally haven't given me a key to the garage!!!!"

at this point i'm furious. so i march out of the lobby and call the a/v director. and he said he'll call someone to see if they can find a way to get my car out so i don't have to pay. but if they don't, i'm fucked. 

so here i am now, sitting in the office, three hours before my shift is up, an hour and a half from where i live, 7 miles away from the towing company, with no car and an empty stomach. i fucked up pretty bad.

    Here is the summary: car got towed by hotel i'm working for, 1hr30 minutes from where i live. in the middle of winter.

    Here is the article: a rare tifu that actually happened today. well, within the last 24 hours at least.

part of my job includes reading meters so the company can send bills to people.  
to help with reading these meters, we are given a small 8 inch tablet and an electric golf cart to drive around neighborhoods.

i was finished with one area and was loading the cart onto its trailer. i needed both of my hands for a moment, so i placed the tablet on the seat of the cart.

i finished up and hopped into the truck to travel to the next neighborhood. to a quick turn onto a highway and, checking that there was no other vehicles around, reached for my tablet to glance at the address on the list.

where's the tablet? it didn't fall to the floorboard again did it?  
no it didn't.  
it was still on the cart.  
shit.

another look around to make sure there's no oncoming traffic. nope, all clear. one quick u-turn and i'm headed back.

hope i can find it. hope it's not too damaged.  
...
and in the 20 seconds it takes to get back to the neighborhood entrance, 4 cars pass me going in the other direction.  
and there's the tablet.  
in the lane of traffic.  
completely crushed and broken.
with several day's worth of readings that had not been uploaded to the company's database yet.

fuck.  
i just wanted a normal week. one where i finished on time and didn't have to work overtime. i was on track to be on time too.  
in less than a minute, my weekend disappears and i'll be working instead of visiting family.

boss was not too pleased either.

    Here is the summary: - for got work tablet on trailer. it fell off and was crushed. ruined any hope i had of having a normal work week.

    Here is the article: this happen two days ago at work:

it was casual friday so i wore my favorite jeans, and since the only clean pair of underwear i had were worn out with a stretched elastic band that slides around my waste, i naturally went commando. 
i hadn't shat that morning as usual, buy all seemed well through the morning. now, usually i bring my lunch to work, but this day i decided to splurge and go to mcdonalds. after i eat, i am standing by my car in the company parking lot enjoying a cigarette when i feel a bubble deep in my gut... ok, i think, this feels like the perfect post mcd's fart to let rip in the parking lot before i go back to work, you know, get it out before i'm back in close cubical quarters...

but this one was different... it started out like the fart it was expecting, so i loosened up a bit... and then it just started dribbling out... it must have been built up from the night before, but it just came coming out at a slow dribble, and my intense clenching was all that was holding it back... i proceeded to dance around in the parking lot trying to grab my car keys from my pocket while vigorously clenching my butthole in my now heavily soiled favorite jeans. ( keep in mind i'm commando.) 

i scramble into my car where i grab my mcdonalds bag from lunch and proceed to fill it with my own version of a big mac...not knowing what to do with it, i wrapped the bag in my ruined jeans, and took off for home... so with no pants on, and smelling like i shit myself, while driving with a toxic bundle to prove i did, i was okay being late back from lunch. 

i go home to shower, throw on some clean clothes, and i head straight back. no sweat. nobody would notice if i was a little late back from lunch... and maybe nobody will notice my different colored jeans. 
so i show back up to work, about 45 minutes late, to find a group of coworkers standing in the doorway about to go on their lunch breaks, and they are having a conversation about if i had actually shit my pants or not... i guess someone had pointed me out through the office window and they all saw me dance around and hop in my car and drive off...
and i even had one coworker point out in front of everyone that i had different pants on...

 

edit: i didn't even use a throwaway... this actually happened...

    Here is the summary: went commando on casual friday, shat my pants in the parking lot for the whole office to see.

it was casual friday so i wore my favorite jeans, and since the only clean pair of underwear i had were worn out with a stretched elastic band that slides around my waste, i naturally went commando. 
i hadn't shat that morning as usual, buy all seemed well through the morning. now, usually i bring my lunch to work, but this day i decided to splurge and go to mcdonalds. after i eat, i am standing by my car in the company parking lot enjoying a cigarette when i feel a bubble deep in my gut... ok, i think, this feels like the perfect post mcd's fart to let rip in the parking lot before i go back to work, you know, get it out before i'm back in close cubical quarters...

but this one was different... it started out like the fart it was expecting, so i loosened up a bit... and then it just started dribbling out... it must have been built up from the night before, but it just came coming out at a slow dribble, and my intense clenching was all that was holding it back... i proceeded to dance around in the parking lot trying to grab my car keys from my pocket while vigorously clenching my butthole in my now heavily soiled favorite jeans. ( keep in mind i'm commando.) 

i scramble into my car where i grab my mcdonalds bag from lunch and proceed to fill it with my own version of a big mac...not knowing what to do with it, i wrapped the bag in my ruined jeans, and took off for home... so with no pants on, and smelling like i shit myself, while driving with a toxic bundle to prove i did, i was okay being late back from lunch. 

i go home to shower, throw on some clean clothes, and i head straight back. no sweat. nobody would notice if i was a little late back from lunch... and maybe nobody will notice my different colored jeans. 
so i show back up to work, about 45 minutes late, to find a group of coworkers standing in the doorway about to go on their lunch breaks, and they are having a conversation about if i had actually shit my pants or not... i guess someone had pointed me out through the office window and they all saw me dance around and hop in my car and drive off...
and i even had one coworker point out in front of everyone that i had different pants on...

 

edit: i didn't even use a throwaway... this actually happened...

    Here is the summary: I wore my favorite jeans to work.

    Output format: PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE

    Evaluation Criteria:
    1. Read the news article carefully and identify the main topic and key points.
    2. Read the summary and compare it to the news article. Check if the summary covers the main topic and key points of the news article, and if it resents them in a clear and logical order.
    3. Rate the summary with 5 percentages, where each one represents how likely the summary is going to get a score from 1 to 5. For example, if you think the summary is 80% likely to get a score of 5, 10% likely to get a score of 4, 5% likely to get a score of 3, 3% likely to get a score of 2, and 1% likely to get a score of 1, you should rate the summary as 80, 10, 5, 3, 2.

    Here is the article: drip, drip, drip.  
that is the sound that should have been emanating from my kitchen sink last night--a night that promised to be one of the coldest of the season.   
i'm getting ahead of myself though.  so let's back up to about 10:30 pm est last night.  kids are in bed.  my wife and i are kicked back and relaxing, about to watch something on netflix.  the furnace kicks on for probably the hundredth time that day.  this time however, a weird sloshing sound echoes its way up the duct-work and into our living room.  the furnace groans, shudders, sloshes once more, and dies.  
down into the basement i go.  this has happened before, and i know what the problem is, but i have been ignoring the root cause for some time now. so i trudge down the rickety stairs into the dry, dusty 145+ year old hand dug dungeon beneath our house.  
two hours later i emerged dirty and tired.  i'll spare you the details, but the repair required the use of some high temperature silicone that needed to set for a few hours before i could run the furnace, which meant i would need to wake up in the middle of the night to turn it back on.  
as i was about to go to bed, i remember the sage wisdom that countless cautionary mothers and fathers have told their children since the birth of indoor plumbing: when it gets really cold, let the tap run.  my mind goes immediately to the most vulnerable plumbing in our house where the water supply lines to our kitchen sink run under the crawl space and up against an exterior wall, which also happens to be the point in our house farthest from the furnace.  the temperature is dropping quickly in our home, but my lazy, tired, penny-pinching, and water-waste hating brain figures that everything would be okay because i would be turning the furnace back on in a few hours.  this is where ifu.  not only my delayed repairs necessitate taking the furnace offline for an extended period during one of the coldest nights of the year, but i also decide to forgo any kind of mitigating measures to protect my plumbing from freezing.  nevertheless, satisfied in my logic, i set my alarm to wake up in a couple hours and go to sleep.  (i do get up, run to the thermostat and turn the furnace back on at about 4:00 am).  
i wake up the next morning and head over to my computer to start my "telecommute" while my wife goes into the kitchen to make a pot of coffee. the next words i hear send shivers down my spine.  
"honey, the faucet isn't working!"  
well, damn.  guess i'm not so smart after all.  fortunately, the plumbing is still frozen so we aren't the proud owners of the newest in-ground swimming pool on our block.  i am guardedly hopeful that maybe the pipes didn't burst at all, but my fears are confirmed a few minutes later when the hair dryer i was using to thaw the lines unleashes a torrent of water into the crawl space.  i rush down into the basement and over to the shutoff valve, which supplies water to the whole house.  
i take stock of the situation.  no water means no cooking and more importantly no toilets.  we run a tight budget with little room for emergencies like this one.  dismayed, i call my boss and inform him that i won't be able to make a demo meeting scheduled later that day, and would in fact have to take the day off.  he is graciously understanding.  i'm paid hourly, but can make up the lost time on the weekend.  
i've never done any plumbing before, but my diy do-anything-so-long-as-i-have-an-internet-connection-google-and-youtube spirit kicks into overdrive.  i kicked ass with the furnace last night--so why not try my hand at re-plumbing the kitchen?  
i tromp down to the basement and rip out the old pvc piping, examine all of the components and get to work measuring and sketching out what i figured i would need from the hardware store.  i intentionally overestimated the pipe length i would need to ensure i didn't need to make a second trip.  one cold drive, $30 and a couple hours later i return with everything i need to replace the plumbing.  i go to work with a hacksaw and hobble the parts together with pvc glue and a prayer.  
only one obstacle now stands in the way of success:  the crawlspace.  the kitchen which i must now re-plumb is "newer" than the rest of the house, jutting out from the original footprint like a old 1940's motorcycle sidecar.  it sits over a crawlspace which was hacked into the midwestern clay around the middle of the last century.  this "crawl"space is barely worthy of the name.  boasting less than a foot of clearance under many of the floor joists, it is home to construction trash and many unspeakable things.  what is normally a dusty clay "floor" is now a muddy, slimy mess thanks to the broken pipe.  a thick mat of cobwebs reflects the light from my headlamp, in some places obscuring my view of what lies beyond.  now i must thread my newly assembled pipes through this tangled mess of detritus and debris.  
  it is difficult to describe just how gnarly things are down there.  i climb in head first, shoving the sink-end of the pipe ahead of me as i go.  i inch forward on my belly; my arms, chest, and legs are shredded as i painfully grate my body across sharp gravel, chunks of brick and old walnut husks.  the dust stings my dry eyes and nostrils, sending me into sneezing fits.  finally i make my way to the far wall beneath the sink, only to realize that i forget to bring the pipe insulation foam with me.  my wife hands it down through the hole under the sink and i struggle in the narrow space to get it on the pipes.  
  once everything is in place, i connect it all together, turn the water supply back on and race to the sink to test my work.  unfortunately, my grey matter failed to remember a cardinal plumbing rule: purge the lines before hooking them up to your fixtures.  as i turn on the faucet, mud and debris picked up during the pipes' arduous journey underneath the kitchen get sent straight into the faucet valve.  the faucet belches air, muddy water, then stops completely.  
   fortunately, i just happened to have a replacement faucet that i have been neglecting to install.  so another hour of work (which involved thoroughly purging the lines) later, and everything is functional again.

    Here is the summary: - put off furnace repairs.  furnace kicks it on a really cold night.  i neglect to let the faucet drip.  pipes freeze and burst, repairs cost me a day of work and leave me beaten, battered, and bruised.

    Here is the article: apologies for discussing my life story but things have been going downhill the past few years and basically has turned into a fucking calamity today.

let's just get the past out of the way. i've never been a really outgoing person and always tended to be reserved, but i wouldn't act the same around others and such in say school because i'd rather be seen as the kid who seems criminally insane rather then the kid who probably slits his wrists when he goes home.

ever since middle school, i have progressively continued to become more of a untamed psychopath in school however i'd become more depressed when i would return home, and it even continues to this day, (being a senior in high school). i had one good friend though in middle school however and was like a brother to me considering i haven't had a father since i was a little kid and i was being raised by my single mom and i had two sisters, so having a friend i can relate to really helped me.

however, come freshman year, i learned quickly how things change. my friend found a relationship, and i respected that. he told me that he still trusted me more than his girlfriend and such, but i wanted to be a good friend and told him to do whatever it takes to make her happy, even if it means not hanging out with me anymore or such, and that is exactly what happened.

at the time i didn't see it as self sacrifice and saw it as a opportunity to return the favor to my best friend whom always gave me advice and motivated me to do what i love to do (which is make films/videos, study computers and play video games lol.) however i didn't realize how hard things would be when you lose your best friend. we honestly hardly ever talked and if we did, things would always end in a argument and on bad terms.
this led to a void in my life that i knew existed, but however (and not to sound all philosophical and corny), but it felt as if my brain and it's logic was fighting my heart and it's fantasies that it would conjure up. i would hope that one day i'd have a friendship that would actually last. this is something that has been toxic throughout the past four years of my life and still plagues me even to today.

i began to make myself an outcast at school, just going to school and coming home. i wouldn't speak to anybody, even my family and would just play video games to hide from the "shittiness" of reality. i met a girl... and long story short i fell in love with her, and was happily met with the prospect that she had the same feelings for me that i had for her. however, things got bad, and not because either of us did anything wrong, i just noticed how depressed she was because we were so young and couldn't meet each other for a while. so idiotically, i let her go on her own terms so she could find someone else in the real world instead of clinging to skype calls and text. i made her hate me so she would break up with me. and the bandage covering that void came off and it just continued to grow.

fast forward to now, there is a girl who i have known since freshman year and our "interaction" was confusing to say the least. we hated eachother, yet we had many mutual friends, so we had to learn to tolerate eachother. but as time went on, i began to actually like her when i got to know her, but kept things to myself as to not start any drama.

i have another friend now who i talk to all the time, (well i talk to him all the time but he has other friends too so he responds when he can), and he is cousins with this girl whom i hated and tolerated.

senior year, (being this year), i was in the worst mental shape ever, and basically at this point i don't even know who i am anymore. i don't know what i like and i lost the passion for everything i once loved to do. the void in my life at this point was about to consume me, however something ridiculous entered my mind and has plagued me. i thought i liked my friend's cousin. i literally made a list stating what made me like her and i made another list countering my fantasy with logic as to why the whole idea of myself liking her was fucked up.

in the end, i thought i might as well talk to her about it (which is how i fucked up today). so i spoke to her about myself having "feelings" for her, and that i couldn't explain why. i just didn't want to lie right in front of her.

her reaction was what i expected. she had a freak fit, going to her friends and telling them exactly what i said (which came from the heart) and her hatred for me grew probably as large as the void that surrounds me.

now i have to face the prospect of being a laughing stock. i honestly never want to have the guts to do anything ballsy ever again. i honestly don't plan on going to prom and i won't walk during graduation. i'll just receive my diploma in the mail and spare those around me.

    Here is the summary: i was always a quiet and reserved person, but as i grew up, i began to fall into a depression and a void began to grow in my life. i constantly would try and fill the void with either my own imaginations or false hopes at somebody actually liking me. this led me to actually grow the balls to tell a girl that hated me that i actually liked her, and now i'm a bigger joke than before. i'm not even going to bother going to prom or my own graduation.

ever since middle school, i have progressively continued to become more of a untamed psychopath in school however i'd become more depressed when i would return home, and it even continues to this day, (being a senior in high school). i had one good friend though in middle school however and was like a brother to me considering i haven't had a father since i was a little kid and i was being raised by my single mom and i had two sisters, so having a friend i can relate to really helped me.

however, come freshman year, i learned quickly how things change. my friend found a relationship, and i respected that. he told me that he still trusted me more than his girlfriend and such, but i wanted to be a good friend and told him to do whatever it takes to make her happy, even if it means not hanging out with me anymore or such, and that is exactly what happened.

at the time i didn't see it as self sacrifice and saw it as a opportunity to return the favor to my best friend whom always gave me advice and motivated me to do what i love to do (which is make films/videos, study computers and play video games lol.) however i didn't realize how hard things would be when you lose your best friend. we honestly hardly ever talked and if we did, things would always end in a argument and on bad terms.
this led to a void in my life that i knew existed, but however (and not to sound all philosophical and corny), but it felt as if my brain and it's logic was fighting my heart and it's fantasies that it would conjure up. i would hope that one day i'd have a friendship that would actually last. this is something that has been toxic throughout the past four years of my life and still plagues me even to today.

i began to make myself an outcast at school, just going to school and coming home. i wouldn't speak to anybody, even my family and would just play video games to hide from the "shittiness" of reality. i met a girl... and long story short i fell in love with her, and was happily met with the prospect that she had the same feelings for me that i had for her. however, things got bad, and not because either of us did anything wrong, i just noticed how depressed she was because we were so young and couldn't meet each other for a while. so idiotically, i let her go on her own terms so she could find someone else in the real world instead of clinging to skype calls and text. i made her hate me so she would break up with me. and the bandage covering that void came off and it just continued to grow.

fast forward to now, there is a girl who i have known since freshman year and our "interaction" was confusing to say the least. we hated eachother, yet we had many mutual friends, so we had to learn to tolerate eachother. but as time went on, i began to actually like her when i got to know her, but kept things to myself as to not start any drama.

i have another friend now who i talk to all the time, (well i talk to him all the time but he has other friends too so he responds when he can), and he is cousins with this girl whom i hated and tolerated.

senior year, (being this year), i was in the worst mental shape ever, and basically at this point i don't even know who i am anymore. i don't know what i like and i lost the passion for everything i once loved to do. the void in my life at this point was about to consume me, however something ridiculous entered my mind and has plagued me. i thought i liked my friend's cousin. i literally made a list stating what made me like her and i made another list countering my fantasy with logic as to why the whole idea of myself liking her was fucked up.

in the end, i thought i might as well talk to her about it (which is how i fucked up today). so i spoke to her about myself having "feelings" for her, and that i couldn't explain why. i just didn't want to lie right in front of her.

her reaction was what i expected. she had a freak fit, going to her friends and telling them exactly what i said (which came from the heart) and her hatred for me grew probably as large as the void that surrounds me.

now i have to face the prospect of being a laughing stock. i honestly never want to have the guts to do anything ballsy ever again. i honestly don't plan on going to prom and i won't walk during graduation. i'll just receive my diploma in the mail and spare those around me.

    Here is the summary: I've never been a really outgoing person and always tended to be reserved, but i wouldn't act the same around others and such in say school because i'd rather be seen as the kid who seems criminally insane rather then the kid who probably slits his wrists when he goes home.

    Here is the article: so about 10 minutes before i leave for work, i go into my pantry to grab my daily breakfast: a pouch of pop tarts. i feel the pack is quite thick, so i open it and, to my surprise, i find 3 pop tarts inside! "wow! such amaze!" i think to myself. i decide to actually toast these three to celebrate this rare occasion. my two-slot toaster ruins the immediate satisfaction, so the third tart waits while the other two toast. now, these are chocolate chip flavored pop tarts, so they aren't frosted and sometimes fall apart. so after the first two are toasted, i pop them out and start toasting the mythical third while i eat the other two. this is where the horror begins.


the toaster, already hot from the first use, nearly instantly destroys the crumbly tart inside, dripping chocolate flavored filling all inside the toaster, with some parts of the tart catching fire. oh, the disappointment as i pull that toaster to the sink to empty the contents and begin to wash it out. months of grime and charred pieces of food join my pop tart down the drain, which somehow clogs the drain and it backs up. already late for work, i leave the disgusting afterbirth of toaster garbage in the sink and attempt to make a 45 minute drive in half that time. running into the office, i throw my lunch into the fridge in its usual spot, only to find some unknown purple bag in my spot. i turn the bag so my own can fit and throw the refrigerator door shut and run to my station to only be 15 minutes late. 


six hours pass, and we break for lunch. the first into the break room, i notice my fuck up: the fridge didn't close. nobody goes into the break room after we start working. the fridge was open for 6 hours and everything in there is warm except mine, which had an ice pack inside. the purple bag i moved had stopped the door from closing. as my coworkers file in to see this disaster, a new employee  recognizes the bag as hers. the looks of anger on everyone's face and the shame on her's were almost too much. she grabs her bag and runs off to the stairs as everyone begins to clean out the fridge. i, the true culprit, grab my cool lunch, heat it up, and begin to be the only person to eat their lunch on our 10 hour shift. the other people mutter something about how "she may be deaf but that doesn't mean she can't show decency." this lunch is getting worse by the minute.

 


update: so how did op fix this situation? an anonymous apology letter promising tcu football tickets (the reason for the purple lunch bag) to a game of her choice, a couple dozen donuts and breakfast burritos as an "apology" "from" her, and an order for over a dozen sandwiches from a local pizza place that everyone loves seems to be doing its magic. everyone's apologizing to her for their behavior and making jokes, she's laughing and has taped up the fridge as a "precaution" and my bank account is weeping in justice and agony.

six hours pass, and we break for lunch. the first into the break room, i notice my fuck up: the fridge didn't close. nobody goes into the break room after we start working. the fridge was open for 6 hours and everything in there is warm except mine, which had an ice pack inside. the purple bag i moved had stopped the door from closing. as my coworkers file in to see this disaster, a new employee  recognizes the bag as hers. the looks of anger on everyone's face and the shame on her's were almost too much. she grabs her bag and runs off to the stairs as everyone begins to clean out the fridge. i, the true culprit, grab my cool lunch, heat it up, and begin to be the only person to eat their lunch on our 10 hour shift. the other people mutter something about how "she may be deaf but that doesn't mean she can't show decency." this lunch is getting worse by the minute.

 


update: so how did op fix this situation? an anonymous apology letter promising tcu football tickets (the reason for the purple lunch bag) to a game of her choice, a couple dozen donuts and breakfast burritos as an "apology" "from" her, and an order for over a dozen sandwiches from a local pizza place that everyone loves seems to be doing its magic. everyone's apologizing to her for their behavior and making jokes, she's laughing and has taped up the fridge as a "precaution" and my bank account is weeping in justice and agony.

    Here is the summary: I woke up early to go to the gym.

    Here is the article: it’s my birthday today. happy birthday to me!
my day started well, favorite breakfast, lunch at the street corner on my work, and dinner with friends and family. now as i lay in my bed, my phone beeps for an alarm for my birthday with a letter attachment to it. i wrote myself a letter last year of the things i should do, adventures i should take, lessons i need to learn etc. as i go through the letter i can’t help but notice that i almost accomplished all of those things on the letter.  except for my biggest fu.

i told myself to stop dating different girl every month and just focus on one. and i did. i met her, and with her i am me, no holding back, no lies, not pretending, i am just me. last year was an amazing year because i have her. then i fu. i broke up with her because i got cold feet and i thought we were going too fast and we are going serious too soon. 

now that it is my birthday, i never felt alone. yes, i have my family but i have an estranged relationship with all of them. i have my friends who i met through games but i they never understand the real me. i had her, nothing else matter except her but i lost her because my 25 year old me broke up with her one sunny wednesday thinking it is the right thing to do. of course the player in me, ignore all her calls, and texts, and never answer the door to even just talk. 

if i could go back to fall of last year, i would kick myself in the balls, or i would even touch habanero peppers then remove my contacts and wank without even washing my hands to learn my lesson. 

i never felt so alone, so on my birthday, i hope you guys learn from my lesson. it’s ok to be afraid, to get scared, to feel overwhelmed, because of the end of the day, you have that someone and the feeling being loved is the greatest feeling of all. (plus, you don’t want to ever experience the habanero situation!)

    Here is the summary: it’s my birthday today and i never felt alone because my 25 year old me last year wrote me list of things i should have done like stop dating different girl every month and be serious with one girl, which i did but i got cold feet and broke up with her. i deserve the habanero situation right now.

so there's a place behind my kids' school where a few parents park to get their kids and avoid the idiots who use the pickup lane. it's a graveled dirt area next to a drainage ditch with what's best described as a flood plane. the floodplain area is lower than the parking area and where i usually park is at the edge of a drop-off. usually, so as not to back over unseen kids we drive forward in such a way that we don't go into the floodplain but still proceed uninterrupted. in [this picture](http://www.imgur.com/emmipmn.jpeg), just in front of the rear tire you can see where it all went bad. it's been raining here in northern california and the ground was soft. my front slipped and i thought, well, not going forward so i tried to back up. when that didn't work i decided all i could do was go forward. that didn't work as there wasn't enough clearance to get enough speed to use inertia push the front end over the edge. what i didn't know was that the back end now had dropped down and there was no going backwards,as you see [here](http://i.imgur.com/whz94my.jpg ). thankfully aca was able to help. but this is morning i saw a bunch of kids who walked past me yesterday pointing and laughing at the churned up dirt.

    Here is the article: this happened a couple of months ago and i posted it as a reply to a comment on /r/movies .

so i had been hearing about the movie and how good it is at work and everyone sort of refused to tell part of the storyline because of the obvious twist. another quirk of mine is that if i hear of a good movie, i never watch the trailer and just go, often by myself, and enjoy it.

so, given the amount of women telling me it was a great movie, and given that i was meeting a beautiful blonde girl for our first date at a cool new bar, i thought it might be a good idea to suggest a movie after a few drinks. i was super nervous about the date because it was a very good friend's cousin, and he is super protective of her.

this is not a usual first date move for me, if the conversation is flowing why the hell would i want to sit for 2 hours and watch a movie when i could be having a great time getting to know the girl sitting in front of me, right?

well it turns out that's exactly what i should have done. however this girl was highly organised and factual and blunt. she didn't really enjoy my stories of mexico and europe without bursting in to ask unimportant details about monuments, or trumping it with details about how daddy took her to the tower d'argent on the champs elysee etc etc.

so i threw out the hail mary, "hey, you wanna see gone girl? it's on at 815 across the road and its $5 tickets tonight, could be fun to see it."

she was like "but everyone i know has said it's totally crap etc etc"
"nah it's amazing its got like 4/5 in every review i've seen"
"ok, i'll see it, only to prove you wrong..."

so we go, everything's actually good because we had a bit of banter about what movies we liked and what we didn't and actually had very similar tastes, and to be honest i was starting to see what everyone liked about this girl, her bossy exterior was a bit of a front and underneath, when she smiled, i could see a flutter of excitement she didn't often let herself feel.

i decided to reveal that i sometimes went to movies by myself; that i didn't see the point of seeing it with other people because most of the time they talk etc etc. and she agreed seriously, didn't think i was a weirdo. she loves recharging herself and everything.
so we get to the movie and take a seat, it's pretty packed because its a cheap night but we get good seats and i settle in for a good movie with someone who is now a good person.

cue:the movie. throughout the entire thing i would look at her and see this stony, glazed over look and she didn't react once to any of the huge reveals. i really thought she was just heaps into it. when the films rolled a single tear rolled down her face and she stood quickly and made as if to go.

i walked out, still kind of oblivious and actually raving about the movie, until she turned, said 'good night' and hopped into the cab without another word.
i was like wtf? but obviously she had her reasons i spose so just sent her a text saying thanks for the evening, hopefully we could do it again another time.

because my tendency is to 'drunk' text girls when i feel the buzz of liking someone and saying stupid shit, i always turn my phone off after a date, all night and then go afresh in the morning.
i woke up expecting a text or a thankyou or even a call from my mate threatening to kill me, but there was nothing, not a word. so i left it at that and went about my day.

later that night i met up with some mates and talked and one of them asked how the date was, and then i explained it. most of them were the same as me, completely perplexed, but one of my friends looked concerned.

he got me alone and explained everything. the girl i took on that date, the lovely girl with a rich daddy and everything else, her mother murdered her father and then turned the gun on herself when she was about 8. her rich aunt and uncle, who had never had kids, had raised her as their own, and doted upon her in the way only people who have never been able to have kids can.
and i had just taken her to gone girl on a fucking first date.


my mate who is her cousin completely understood luckily, and with his help she got back into contact and i acted completely oblivious until she chose to come forward to me with her side.


we have now been together for a couple of moths and i love every second of it.


 

edit: people are pointing out this wasn't a fuck up since we're now together- it was most certainly a fuck up, albeit unintentional. 

she says now that she thought i was playing a cruel prank because she assumed her cousin had told me, and also assumed that evreyone would know about her history and be talking about her behind her back so she hated me for doing it to her. it took a lot to bring her back on board and now she *almost* laughs it off. *almost*

so, given the amount of women telling me it was a great movie, and given that i was meeting a beautiful blonde girl for our first date at a cool new bar, i thought it might be a good idea to suggest a movie after a few drinks. i was super nervous about the date because it was a very good friend's cousin, and he is super protective of her.

this is not a usual first date move for me, if the conversation is flowing why the hell would i want to sit for 2 hours and watch a movie when i could be having a great time getting to know the girl sitting in front of me, right?

well it turns out that's exactly what i should have done. however this girl was highly organised and factual and blunt. she didn't really enjoy my stories of mexico and europe without bursting in to ask unimportant details about monuments, or trumping it with details about how daddy took her to the tower d'argent on the champs elysee etc etc.

so i threw out the hail mary, "hey, you wanna see gone girl? it's on at 815 across the road and its $5 tickets tonight, could be fun to see it."

she was like "but everyone i know has said it's totally crap etc etc"
"nah it's amazing its got like 4/5 in every review i've seen"
"ok, i'll see it, only to prove you wrong..."

so we go, everything's actually good because we had a bit of banter about what movies we liked and what we didn't and actually had very similar tastes, and to be honest i was starting to see what everyone liked about this girl, her bossy exterior was a bit of a front and underneath, when she smiled, i could see a flutter of excitement she didn't often let herself feel.

i decided to reveal that i sometimes went to movies by myself; that i didn't see the point of seeing it with other people because most of the time they talk etc etc. and she agreed seriously, didn't think i was a weirdo. she loves recharging herself and everything.
so we get to the movie and take a seat, it's pretty packed because its a cheap night but we get good seats and i settle in for a good movie with someone who is now a good person.

cue:the movie. throughout the entire thing i would look at her and see this stony, glazed over look and she didn't react once to any of the huge reveals. i really thought she was just heaps into it. when the films rolled a single tear rolled down her face and she stood quickly and made as if to go.

i walked out, still kind of oblivious and actually raving about the movie, until she turned, said 'good night' and hopped into the cab without another word.
i was like wtf? but obviously she had her reasons i spose so just sent her a text saying thanks for the evening, hopefully we could do it again another time.

because my tendency is to 'drunk' text girls when i feel the buzz of liking someone and saying stupid shit, i always turn my phone off after a date, all night and then go afresh in the morning.
i woke up expecting a text or a thankyou or even a call from my mate threatening to kill me, but there was nothing, not a word. so i left it at that and went about my day.

later that night i met up with some mates and talked and one of them asked how the date was, and then i explained it. most of them were the same as me, completely perplexed, but one of my friends looked concerned.

he got me alone and explained everything. the girl i took on that date, the lovely girl with a rich daddy and everything else, her mother murdered her father and then turned the gun on herself when she was about 8. her rich aunt and uncle, who had never had kids, had raised her as their own, and doted upon her in the way only people who have never been able to have kids can.
and i had just taken her to gone girl on a fucking first date.


my mate who is her cousin completely understood luckily, and with his help she got back into contact and i acted completely oblivious until she chose to come forward to me with her side.


we have now been together for a couple of moths and i love every second of it.


 

edit: people are pointing out this wasn't a fuck up since we're now together- it was most certainly a fuck up, albeit unintentional. 

she says now that she thought i was playing a cruel prank because she assumed her cousin had told me, and also assumed that evreyone would know about her history and be talking about her behind her back so she hated me for doing it to her. it took a lot to bring her back on board and now she *almost* laughs it off. *almost*

    Here is the summary: I had been hearing about the movie and how good it is at work and everyone sort of refused to tell part of the storyline because of the obvious twist.

    Here is the article: (alt account because i'd rather not have this connected to me.)

so, i had always heard that you feel fuller if you drink water.  i have the problem that i always get hungry during school, no matter if the size of my breakfast and lunch.  so this week i decided i would try to drink a lot of water to curb that hunger.

i have a 32 oz water bottle i use. i just started by refilling it a whole bunch.  the first day (tuesday) i had 1.8 gallons or so.  i peed a lot, and i felt a bit weird, but i shrugged it off.

the next day (wednesday) i had about 1 gallon of water.  i had a similar weird feeling, but again, i didn't think much of it.  my mood was a tiny bit swingy.  i felt a bit...hyper at times.  like drinking a good amount of caffeine.  other times i was a bit sleepy.

but i'm a teenager so i sorta thought it was hormones or whatever.  and i didn't think it was serious.

thursday i had another gallon.  same weird feeling, except a bit worse.  but only a bit.

friday i had 1.8 gallons.  then...stuff went downhill.

i was acting noticeably weird, like i had a lot of caffeine or something.  and i felt nauseous on and off.  but again i decided to shrug it off.  when i was about to leave to go home, i decided to check webmd because i was worried about over hydration.

the symptoms matched up fairly perfectly.  and there were was a possibility of death.

i begin to get nervous.  i have vasovagal, which basically means when i get nervous the veins in my legs hyper expand and the blood pools in my legs and i faint.  so i start to feel vasovagal coming on so i pull over at sorta sketchy looking immediate care place.

they rush out and don't really know what to do, so they call an ambulance.  said ambulance comes and the paramedics spend a bit of time with me and eventually come to the conclusion that the biggest problem when my vasovagal.

i told them the dealio with the water but they seemed to think it wasn't super big of a deal.

so i go home and lay down.  have a few pretzels.  i'm beginning to feel a bit...loopy.  i'm forgetting words, replacing them with the wrong ones, having trouble reading.

i call my doctor to check in with her.  she says i should go to the er, pronto.

well, by now the loopiness is getting worse.  i would say things and then think of them moments later.  so i'm not in any condition to drive, so i call my mom to ask her to drive me to the er.

so there was a huge storm earlier that day and nearly all of the lights were out on the way.  so it took forever.

and i couldn't stop talking.  it was scary.  i would hold my hand out in front of my face and just stare at it.

my mom has problems with anxiety, so she's a bit crazy.

we finally get to the er and by now the loopiness is at it's worst.  i can't focus on what people are saying. i have to have people repeat everything multiple times.  i'm making a fool of myself.  i pick up a penny on the counter and just stare at it.  i'm loud.

so i get shuffled to a room.

they end up thinking i did drugs.  i've never done drugs. i never want to do drugs.  but i'm acting like i had ecstasy, not that i would know, i was told after the fact.

so they tell me to pee in a cup for a drug test.  i have trouble doing so for some reason.  i make a fool do myself my looking and my penis and telling it to "pee" multiple times.  a couple minutes later i actually accomplish this, but it was awkward at best.

i turn up clean, of course.  but if i had had ecstasy, it wouldn't turn up on the test anyway.

so a special doctor well suited to...getting teens to tell them about this sort of thing comes in.  we talk for a while but he's not super satisfied by my answers.  i'm still very loopy.  i say crazy things, things that sound...druggy at best.  "ohhhhhh i hate drugs.  i never wanna do drugs.  because...i hate them.  i promise i wouldn't eeeeever do that."

so he decides to talk to me alone.  i don't quite get that he's trying to see only if i'm doing drugs primarily.  he's stressing that he won't tell anyone.  i, for some reason, decide to tell him all sorts of random, inapplicable secrets.  bluh

so at least he's convinced i didn't do drugs.  i lay down and try to sleep.  they put me on a saline drip.

apparently my kidney couldn't process all that water.  so it floods to cells, or something.  and most cells can...do that.  but not brain cells.

so i'm feeling a bit less loopy, but i'm still having trouble focusing, but i have a pounding headache.

it was awful.

so eventually they move me to a different hospital because it's more specialized apparently, but likely it was for liability reasons.

i wake up (today) and am no longer super loopy.  still on a drip.  they're planning to release me soon.

    Here is the summary: i drank about 50 pounds of water in 4 days, and acted extraordinarily high.

    Here is the article: so this happened less than half an hour ago. although i have had a root canal done more than 5 years ago, and being deathly afraid of dentists did not make it any pleasant.

so fast forward to present day. we are having a small office party of sorts, with cake and snacks and the likes. i am standing around with a bunch of my colleagues, enjoying the yummy chocolate cake and free snacks. 

i'm upto the last bite of cake and i hear a cringeworthy crunch inside my mouth and without thinking about it it spit  the half eaten cake out of my mouth. i see a white solid mass. at first i think "ooh white chocolate" , and then i touch it and it feels very tooth like. again without thinking about it i yell... "omg there's a tooth in the cake!!!" my teammate next to me stops her spoon midway and just looks disgusted, so do all of the others including the director. for a minute or so i think "i'm gonna sue!!"

then i make a big mistake and turn it around and see that some cake is stuffed inside the tooth. my incredibly slow mind thinks,"hmmm .. weird, the tooth is hollow". and it dawns on me slower than i am proud of, just when other colleague yells, "ewww it's your tooth". needless to say laughter ensues, and i am standing there still not believing that i just chewed my root canal crown off with a piece of chocolate cake. not hard candy, not sugarcane, not an apple, but a piece of really yummy and moist chocolate cake.  

obviously i can't just run away so i stand there just trying to shift focus to something else, but people just carry on laughing , whispering. i excuse myself finally and go to the restroom wash the cake filled cap and my mouth and come back to my desk, wishing i was invisible. 

of course the first thing i think is, "hey let more people on reddit laugh at me"

    Here is the summary: got a root canal 5 years ago, cap fell off today in front of colleagues on a bite of chocolate cake. i'm mortified and wishing i was invisible. and dreading a visit to the dentist.

    3. Rate the summary with 5 percentages, where each one represents how likely the summary is going to get a score from 1 to 5. For example, if you think the summary is 80% likely to get a score of 5, 10% likely to get a score of 4, 5% likely to get a score of 3, 3% likely to get a score of 2, and 1% likely to get a score of 1, you should rate the summary as 80, 10, 5, 3, 2.

    Here is the article: so this happened less than half an hour ago. although i have had a root canal done more than 5 years ago, and being deathly afraid of dentists did not make it any pleasant.

so fast forward to present day. we are having a small office party of sorts, with cake and snacks and the likes. i am standing around with a bunch of my colleagues, enjoying the yummy chocolate cake and free snacks. 

i'm upto the last bite of cake and i hear a cringeworthy crunch inside my mouth and without thinking about it it spit  the half eaten cake out of my mouth. i see a white solid mass. at first i think "ooh white chocolate" , and then i touch it and it feels very tooth like. again without thinking about it i yell... "omg there's a tooth in the cake!!!" my teammate next to me stops her spoon midway and just looks disgusted, so do all of the others including the director. for a minute or so i think "i'm gonna sue!!"

then i make a big mistake and turn it around and see that some cake is stuffed inside the tooth. my incredibly slow mind thinks,"hmmm .. weird, the tooth is hollow". and it dawns on me slower than i am proud of, just when other colleague yells, "ewww it's your tooth". needless to say laughter ensues, and i am standing there still not believing that i just chewed my root canal crown off with a piece of chocolate cake. not hard candy, not sugarcane, not an apple, but a piece of really yummy and moist chocolate cake.  

obviously i can't just run away so i stand there just trying to shift focus to something else, but people just carry on laughing , whispering. i excuse myself finally and go to the restroom wash the cake filled cap and my mouth and come back to my desk, wishing i was invisible. 

of course the first thing i think is, "hey let more people on reddit laugh at me"

    Here is the summary: I just chewed my root canal crown off with a piece of chocolate cake.

    Here is the article: first a bit of back story. (as the title implies, this story has a part on abuse, so just a head up)

i'm 18, had a very rough childhood, my father left quite early on and my mother's boyfriend after him was extremely abusive towards me, my sister and my mum. this led my mum to depression and eventually developing suicidal tendencies, i was very young at the time so i wasn't exposed to a lot of it but it still affected my mental health much later on, my sister who is 4 years older than me (around 8 at the time) caught a lot of what was going on and it made her a bit usntable, so both my sister and my mum were in and out of therapy a lot of the time, eventually my mum asked my grandparents to look after me and my sister for a while and they did, one day my grandparents had a phone call and told me and my sister that my mum was in hospital, she had 'been in an accident' and wasn't well, i didn't completely understand but my sister knew exactly what had happened. in reality my mum's boyfriend had beat her up pretty bad and she was in hospital for quite a while

eventually one of the nurses who ended up being friends with my mum phoned the police after she had told him what had happened and they arrested my mum's boyfriend and we haven't seen him since, this nurse who phoned the police ended up becoming my step father. (and still is to this day and has pretty much fixed our family.)

all of these events lead to us being in therapy together throughout a good chunk of my pre-teen and teenage years. i still have anxiety and self esteem issues, but anyway, on that cheerful note, let's continue.

i started secondary school and had a decent group of friends, they were very supportive with me when they knew about my anxiety and self esteem and were generally the kind of people who would drop anything they were doing to help each other out with a problem, i eventually started to gain more confidence with them and we became good friends, we continued to be friends for a while, which nearly made me forget about being anxious or nervous and i was happy.

but a group of kids started bullying me around 2 years in and as teenage boys do, they would joke about my mother, which crippled me emotionally and made it very hard for me to talk to people, i was silent a lot of the time because i was to scared to draw attention to myself which put a bit of distance between me and my friends, my friends supported me through it and helped me out the best they could. 

eventually i talked to my sister about what was happening and she told me "just try and be friends with them, you never know, you might get along".

when year 9 came along and we needed to pick classes, i chose science, and when i showed up i was seated next to one of the boys who was friends with the people who bullied me, i was really nervous and considered dropping out of my favourite subject several times, but one lesson we were grouped with the person next to us for a project, we started talking because of this and we slowly became friends and eventually i became 'friends' with the group of people who bullied me (you'll know why friends was quoted soon), this pushed me away from the group of friends i started school with and we eventually stopped talking completely, which made me quite depressed for a while (and i still regret it to this day.) but i started to grow more confident with the group of people who i had just become friends with and would hang out with them after school and go to parties with them.

then within the last few months of school my 'friends' completely abandoned me, they ignored me, pushed me around and didn't want me to be around them any more and started to bully me again, which triggered my anxiety and self esteem issues to surface again. so i spent the last few months of school completely alone, i had no one to talk to, no one i felt comfortable enough to even approach and i never had the confidence to even think about going back to see my original friends just out of shame.

now i'm 18 nearly 19, have anxiety issues, self esteem issues, commitment issues and am completely alone.

so don't listen to the person who tells you to be friends with a bully, stay with the friends who support you through it, take it from someone who experienced the negative outcome, it's not worth it.

    Here is the summary: tried to be friends with my bullies, ended up with no friends at all.

    Here is the article: the fu either happened on wednesday or back in 2011... you decide. also, f throwaway accounts. 

just started grad school in 2011, broke up with my girl of 3 years and was cruising singles apps for love. one night, girl agreed to go see drive with me. 

she shows up in sweats and a tshirt with no bra, but has this weird strut when she walks.  she said she ice skates but whatever. acting totally weird. she goes to the bathroom and i seriously consider bailing. 

anyways, movie starts and is boring so i reach over and her legs were really wide apart. move my hand up a bit then rub her boobs. they were unnaturally firm c cups (for someone who goes out without a bra). but again whatever, i was feeling tits. next thing i know, i'm finger banging her with her sweats pulled down about half way.

she gets up and goes to the bathroom again. when she comes back i restart fingering her and she's pretty darn wet now. i go to switch hands and, like any man would probably do, i start to put my fingers in my mouth. barely... before she snatches my wrist and almost yells at me to not do that and gets up and leaves. 

i thought "well, i'm lucky i dodged crazy", waited a bit and left. 

maybe a day later, i get an email from a new email account saying they saw me on the app that i deleted after that encounter, and had sent me some stock photos of a hot girl. i immediately google'd the email address. that was one of the major fus. 

i found a very long xanga from some kind girl (p) talking about the girl (amanda) i had gone out with. i went and made popcorn and started to read... i only took one bite. 

this young p was a cancer-surviving ice skater who met amanda at her local rink and had fallen in love with them. amanda claimed she had cancer too and p ended up getting her family to give about $20,000 to help with amanda's medical costs. however, amanda was lying and used the money for something else... sexual reassignment surgery. p had fallen in love with amanda when amanda was still just "aman". 

i made my peace quickly with what had happened and emailed back the troll account and said i read all about her from when she lived in her of home town and all i got back was "oh". i pretty much completely forgot about it. 

until reddit... i was reading some thread on wednesday and someone brought up vaginoplasty, specifically sigmoid colon vaginoplasty. i google'd it having been ignorantly in bliss for the last few years, which turned into my most recent fu. 

sgv is a reassignment where, and please please please correct me if i'm wrong, they replace a portion of the new "vagina" with a section of a person's colon in order to produce a natural lubricant. it has its own texture, scent and flavor; different but not bad. 

needless to say, i think i'm having trouble now coming to terms with possibly having tasted some dude's colon secretions.

    Here is the summary: i thought i was fingering a girl's pussy when i was actually fingering a guy's ass.

until reddit... i was reading some thread on wednesday and someone brought up vaginoplasty, specifically sigmoid colon vaginoplasty. i google'd it having been ignorantly in bliss for the last few years, which turned into my most recent fu. 

sgv is a reassignment where, and please please please correct me if i'm wrong, they replace a portion of the new "vagina" with a section of a person's colon in order to produce a natural lubricant. it has its own texture, scent and flavor; different but not bad. 

needless to say, i think i'm having trouble now coming to terms with possibly having tasted some dude's colon secretions.

    Here is the summary: I went out with a girl who was an ice skater and had a weird strut when she walked.

    3. Rate the summary with 5 percentages, where each one represents how likely the summary is going to get a score from 1 to 5. For example, if you think the summary is 80% likely to get a score of 5, 10% likely to get a score of 4, 5% likely to get a score of 3, 3% likely to get a score of 2, and 1% likely to get a score of 1, you should rate the summary as 80, 10, 5, 3, 2.

    Here is the article: backstory: i am a senior in school for the past 8 months. on days that i have math, there was usually a "mentally challenged" student who would be in the halls. now, in my school, kids with harsh disabilities such as being mentality challenged and what not have a special classroom on the ground floor in a designated hall. to this day, i don't know why we was upstairs where i have math. i have noticed today, after the incident, that he was "mia" for quite some time, until today.

here we go.

after sitting sitting in math doing nothing, literally nothing other than rewatching the blacklist to recap for tonights episode, the bell finally rang. i packed up my phone and left class as i always do, little did i know i was about to experience a fuck-up. whilst walking down the hall, i was nearing the stairs and all of a sudden, i heard amd felt someone blowing air on my head, and then swiftly knocks off my glasses of my face, from the back. i never knew what happened until my sight got blurry. i instantly tried to run after my glasses not thinking about how i honestly couldn't see, i ended up stepping on them. 

after i stepped on them, i had no clue where they were because people were walking and i couldn't see a damn thing! fortunately for me, a cute girl was there to help me, and no, we didn't hit anything off or anything of the sort. might i add i was very embarrassed. she was kind enough to assist me in finding my glasses and one lens that apparently ended up being knocked out of the frame. i noticed that i bent my glasses and broke the area of the frame in which the missing lens was supposed to be in. fml, what was i going to do now?

i placed the lens back into the frame and notified my parents and asked them to pick me up early from school so i can get my glasses fixed for i am basically blind without them. so here i am back in class, creating this post on reddit, after i came back from delivering my glasses to the eye doctor to fix and grabbing an old pair from my house. now my parents are pissed i broke my glasses and now they are making me pay the bill to get them fixed.

    Here is the summary: glasses fly, i step on them trying to catch them, broke and bent my frame because i thought i could catch them.

    Here is the article: so this happened about 5 hours ago: i work as a counselor in a day camp, and one of the activities my campers have is karate. now the “dojo” they go to is a block away from the camp (it’s a private martial arts school) and as a counselor i’m responsible for walking my campers to the dojo so that they can practice karate. everything was going fine, we finished up karate and my group, my fellow counselors, and i, all walked back to the camp to eat lunch. when we got to camp there is a 30 foot gate to get in with two doors; one on the left and one 20 feet over to the right. the one on the left was closer to the lunchroom so i naturally walked to that gate. now my idiotic self pulls at the knob and sure enough the door is locked. i look down at my hand and my thumb turns into a red waterfall of blood in a second. i mean its gushing *really* badly. what i pulled wasn’t a door knob but a keyhole that looks like a door knob with a shard of metal attached to it which sliced my thumb right open. i run to the nurse’s office and people’s expressions as i pass them are somewhere between shock and “crap your pants horrified.” one of the people i ran by screamed, “i’m going to faint!” i get to the nurse, and my thumb obviously won’t stop bleeding so i get sent to the doctor. fortunately, it only needed to be glued back together and not stitched up because the cut was on a large piece of skin (that’s what the doctor said i have no clue what it means). i was later told by the camp director that the door i pulled is never meant to be opened from the outside and that the door on the right is used to get into the camp.

    Here is the article: i made this throwaway account for my personal reasons.

so anyway, this happened today, and i'm just back from the hospital.

i was feeling really terrible this morning, so i just wanted to sleep a lot, so i had the genius idea of mixing alcohol and olanzapine. it didn't take long until i started feeling weird, but the weird feeling went away, so i just felt really really drunk and stoned,confused

here where the tifu begins: my parents came home from work, and my mom noticed i was acting strange, and soon she figured what i wasn't lucid, i had an alcohol problem before, so it's really easy for her to tell when i'm drunk.

she got really mad, she started to yell at me, so i went to the bathroom,locked myself in there and started to cry,i felt like the worst person in the world for making my mom feel like that. i stayed there crying for a while.

and when i got back, she and my father where on the living room, my dad was holding my cellphone on his hands, and apparently they saw the chat i had with an old friend of mine earlier (i still don't know how the hell this happened since phone has a lock screen and everything)

and they totally misunderstood what the conversation was about,

the chat between me and my friend was like "hey, i wanna buy that dr beats headphone, do you know if it's even worth it?"

and i said something like "my brother has one" and he replied: "oh,i'm gonna go there and steal it then hahahaha" i only replied a "lol"

my mother called me names and yelled at me for "giving a stranger information about our family and about where we lived" (?) that was pure nonsense, i did not do any of these things.

but before i could even explain, she slapped me hard on my face, so i got really angry and said "that's right, fucking slap me again i don't fucking care"

and i went running to my bedroom, leaving the door a bit ajar, and layed on the floor with my eyes shut, then like 10 minutes later she notices i'm like that for too long, and she screams to my dad that i'm passed out on the floor, for some idiotic reason, i didn't say a word, just stayed in there, not moving at all.

my father had to get a ladder to get in my bedromm by the window, because i was leaning on the door, so he coudn't open it. my father moved me from there,and my mom started screaming my name and slapping me to see if i would "wake up"

i tought this was so fucked up that i just kept in the same position,not moving at all,

then they put me in the car, drove me to the er, and they put me in a weelchair, and when i was finally on the hospital bed, i opened my eyes and stopped pretending, because it would be stupid, since the doctors would find out i was faking it, right?

the doctors asked me a few questions and then they had my stomach pumped when i realized they wanted to insert a tube down my nose, i went batshit crazy, started to scream, cry really loud saying they coudn't do this to me without my permission.

and i kept threatened to sue them if they did. and i also keep crying to my mom saying i was sorry. but it didn't matter, they did anyway, they inserted that giantic tube down my nose and it was the worst pain i've ever had in my life i kept screaming until they removed the tube.

but the nightmare wasn't over. they gave me an intravenous medication on a drip, and i started to feel sick and nauseous, i felt like alex delarge afer the ludovico technique. i felt like sedated, nauseous but at the same time i was restless, i needed to go home quickly.

so i asked a nurse if i could go to the bathroom, she agreed so i went there and removed that damn catheter off of my left hand and i ran out of the bathroom, i could feel the blood dripping from my hand all over the floor.
 when i arrived at the hospital's reception,everyone was staring at me as if i was some crazy bitch, then i saw my parents

i tried to tell them to take me home, but the nurses were called and i had to go back inside and they restarted that goddamn medicine.

then the doctor advised my parents that i should do some mental therapy. 

but my parents explained that i was already seeing a psychiatrist. then we finally went home, and i apologized like hell to my mom.

    Here is the summary: getting too drunk, having a very painful experience at the hospital, and stressing my parents out.

but before i could even explain, she slapped me hard on my face, so i got really angry and said "that's right, fucking slap me again i don't fucking care"

and i went running to my bedroom, leaving the door a bit ajar, and layed on the floor with my eyes shut, then like 10 minutes later she notices i'm like that for too long, and she screams to my dad that i'm passed out on the floor, for some idiotic reason, i didn't say a word, just stayed in there, not moving at all.

my father had to get a ladder to get in my bedromm by the window, because i was leaning on the door, so he coudn't open it. my father moved me from there,and my mom started screaming my name and slapping me to see if i would "wake up"

i tought this was so fucked up that i just kept in the same position,not moving at all,

then they put me in the car, drove me to the er, and they put me in a weelchair, and when i was finally on the hospital bed, i opened my eyes and stopped pretending, because it would be stupid, since the doctors would find out i was faking it, right?

the doctors asked me a few questions and then they had my stomach pumped when i realized they wanted to insert a tube down my nose, i went batshit crazy, started to scream, cry really loud saying they coudn't do this to me without my permission.

and i kept threatened to sue them if they did. and i also keep crying to my mom saying i was sorry. but it didn't matter, they did anyway, they inserted that giantic tube down my nose and it was the worst pain i've ever had in my life i kept screaming until they removed the tube.

but the nightmare wasn't over. they gave me an intravenous medication on a drip, and i started to feel sick and nauseous, i felt like alex delarge afer the ludovico technique. i felt like sedated, nauseous but at the same time i was restless, i needed to go home quickly.

so i asked a nurse if i could go to the bathroom, she agreed so i went there and removed that damn catheter off of my left hand and i ran out of the bathroom, i could feel the blood dripping from my hand all over the floor.
 when i arrived at the hospital's reception,everyone was staring at me as if i was some crazy bitch, then i saw my parents

i tried to tell them to take me home, but the nurses were called and i had to go back inside and they restarted that goddamn medicine.

then the doctor advised my parents that i should do some mental therapy. 

but my parents explained that i was already seeing a psychiatrist. then we finally went home, and i apologized like hell to my mom.

    Here is the summary: I mixed alcohol and olanzapine and felt really really drunk and stoned,confused

    Here is the article: this just happened a couple hours ago before i got off work.

so i work as a delivery guy at a little dinky pizza place just off my college campus. it's a typical slow wednesday night and we finally get a few orders in just after eleven. nothing out of the ordinary, we get a lot of orders from students after the dining halls close around ten. so they whip the pizzas up quick and they send me off to deliver them so we can hurry up and be closed by 12:30-1ish. 

first one goes off no problem, pizza and some cheesy bread exchanged for a twenty and i get to keep the change, done deal. pull up to the next place, a dorm this time. lil guy at the security desk buzzes me in, tell him i have a delivery for 219 and he gives me a guest card to use the elevator. make my way down the hall and knock on the door, pizza in hand. guy answers, slightly confused look on his face. tell him i have a delivery for room 219, large cheese pizza and a normal bread sticks. he kinda perks up and asks how much it was again. i gave him the total and he disappears into the room to get his wallet, comes back, pays and tips me and i leave him the pizza. take the elevator down, give the guard the guest pass and drive on back.

i stroll in at about 11:55 and they had just started closing the kitchen for the night. i start cleaning up the booths (i can't leave until the kitchen is fully closed in case they get another call, so i clean  the things that i know how so i can speed up the process) and wiping down the cash registers, etc. at about 12:20 the phone rings and my boss says to just let it go to the voicemail. we do and about two minutes later it rings again. this time my boss picks it up and we all lean in to try and listen to the conversation.

he murmurs back and forth, starts off by saying we're closed, sorry we aren't taking anymore orders, gets a puzzled look on his face then asks what his order was and his address. turns to me and asks if i remembered to do both deliveries. i say "yeah, pizza and cheesy bread to blahblah and then the pizza and bread sticks to 219." he looks at me like i'm an idiot and fumbles around the receipts, hands one to me and goes back to talking to the customer saying he was sorry and that we would have his order to him as soon as possible because there was a slight mix up. confused, i looked down at the receipt in extreme disappointment as i realize i had mixed up my bosses sloppy 214 to be a 219.  

since i had accidentally delivered to the wrong address, the practically closed kitchen had to be reopened, the pizza remade, redelivered and then kitchen closed down again, keeping us all there for about an extra hour and a half. to top it off, the majority of us had already clocked out, expecting to close at 12:30, so we didn't get paid for it.

    Here is the summary: read 214 as 219, delivered pizza to wrong guy, kept everyone else there for another hour and a half-ish to make another pizza.

    Here is the article: this happened yesterday, finally able to write about it. one of my hobbies involves the use of a deep cycle marine battery in a modified case. this was in my trunk. on the way to work in the morning, i took a corner a little too sharply and felt and heard a bit of a thump from my trunk. i thought nothing of it and finished out my day at work. when i got back in to my car in the afternoon, there was an odd odor permeating everything.  at first i just thought it was maybe a little bit of spilled food that finally started to go off in the sun. then i remembered the thump. i immediately opened my trunk, and the battery was on its side, out of its case. there was a bit of moisture soaked into about 85% of the fabric of my trunk. there was already a little bit of baking soda on the case that i brushed off, which immediately made sizzling sound as it neutralized the acid. deep cycle marine battery acid. covering my trunk. shit.  i rushed to the store, and they were actually out of baking soda. luckily i found a box at home, and also pilfered the one form the fridge. i started sprinkling it around in the back, and there was the chemical reaction everywhere it went. i had to go through 2 full boxes to get everything to stop sizzling, all while the floor was starting to sag and sink and take on the form of the supporting structure underneath. i still have to wait a bit before taking an industrial vacuum to the baking soda and assessing the full damage. this might be eating away at it for a while.

    Here is the summary: battery tipped over in trunk, left it alone all day as the acid spilled and ate through the fabric.**

    Here is the article: today during spanish class my teacher asked me question in front of the class. i slowly said the answer but he didn't hear me so he asked me again. i then proceeded to say dumb answers which got him annoyed. he even then used his computer to show me notes. i still kept answering wrong and he said "we're not gonna stop till you get this." i heard groans and got bad looks from people. to makes things worse my crush was in the class. after 5 minutes i finally answered right. it was so obvious too. i couldn't show my face in class. i realized later my first answer was right.

    Here is the article: so, i work at a homeless shelter. i'm a 5'4 girl, and my shift is from 1 am to 9 am. i work my shift completely alone and don't have much to do until earlier in the morning, aside from signing people in and doing laundry. everyone sleeps upstairs, and the downstairs is completely empty during the night. there had been movement on the downstairs camera, but it was dark and i thought i had been imagining it in my fear. downstairs there is a huge mess hall, and a lot of side rooms. i have to go downstairs and through the mess hall to get quarters for the laundry, and had been putting it off until it was a little bit brighter outside since i was too spooked to do it right away (i know, that's really dumb). so, it's about 5 30 and there's finally a dull blue light outside. i decide to go down and grab quarters. i run through the mess hall and go to the side office and start unlocking the door. as i open it, i turn around to see a woman standing a few feet back facing me completely blank faced. i felt my jaw fall and was so terrified i couldn't even speak. i thought i was having a heart attack. i ran into the office and slammed the door shut behind me. this lady proceeds to walk over and annoyedly knock on the window, asking what time it is. i snapped out of my terror and realized she must have been assigned a downstairs bed for whatever reason, and the person who works before me forgot to mention it.

    Here is the article: i fucked up yesterday, big time.

my high school is a total non-cheating nazi, if they find out a student cheats on a quiz, exam, or homework. there will be harsh consequences for anyone caught cheating or giving information about tests/quizzes.
	
in algebra 2, we go over a system of linear equations worksheet; it was also the last class of the day. the professor finished class reviewing and i just place the worksheet inside my binder (note it was a 2”, so it was hard to grab it with one hand since i’m small). i didn’t open the rings or placed it inside a binder folder, i simply slid the worksheet inside and placed my binder on the floor (1st fuck up).

the teacher starts handing out quizzes and i receive mine. when i finished the last equation of the quiz, i looked at my watch and noticed there were 3 minutes left before the bell rang. so i moved my quiz aside and started to pack my things up. i grabbed my binder with one hand (2nd fuck up), suddenly the binder opens because of my small hands and the worksheet fell out of my binder and traveled a good 3 inches away from me (3rd fuck up). i placed my binder inside my backpack and stretched to reach the worksheet. suddenly, the professor finally sees me and shouts my name out loud to come see him. he then asks me why i was trying to grab a paper on the floor and i explain that it fell from my binder. i suddenly start to get the feeling he didn’t believe me, so i give him the worksheet as proof (4th fuck up). i then witness his face go from “police inspector” to “you’re going down motherfucker”. he doesn’t believe me, sends me to see the principal, i stay afterschool for 2 more hours explaining that i was not cheating and it was just a simple accident. long story short, the principal doesn’t believe me either and calls my parents, i loose eligibility on entering nhs and student president, have to go to a saturday detention, automatically get a 0 on the quiz, and worst of all is that it will show up that i “cheated” during a quiz to colleges.
i am now writing this having 5 minutes before going to school to serve saturday detention.

    Here is the summary: finished a quiz, placed binder in backpack, worksheet containing info about the quiz fell. professor catches me, send me to office, the principal doesn't believe my story, and obtain hell as my punishment.

this day instead of asking someone i knew i asked some random guy who came out, he told me "no that's be dishonest." i said okay and walked away. a friend who i've asked previously came up to me and told me a bit about it, and as he was turning away he said "and i didn't tell you anything" and my professor was walking in the enclosed hallway where a door was open. but he just started talking the my friend as they were walking away.
i don't know if he heard that and asked about it, or that random guy told him, but today i got called into his office and he told me that was dishonest and that he wanted to think my grade(over a 95) was not because i was getting an advantage over people. he told me i'm going to have to earn his trust back and show him that i'm an a student. he let me off with a warning. 
i don't know why i didn't think this was cheating. i'm the kind of guy who told his math teacher i got a worse grade on a test than she gave me

    Here is the summary: got caught cheating, could've been put on academic probation, lost the respect of one of my favorite professors, feel like shit.

    Here is the article: hopefully this isn't taken off for the whole rape thing but yeah.
sorry for my way of writing i write like i speak. also very first post so yeah sorry about not knowing how to reddit. also good luck finding out were i was.

so 7 years ago (i don't excactly remember when, because privacy) i was at my job at a supermarket when there was a commotion outside the store. since it was late night in winter i thought i'd do the responsible thing of going outside and seeing what it was. turns out there was an assault going on and by the time i got there the guy (or woman (and yes there are female rapists)) was gone. being the responsible employee that i was i went to the female only to be pepper sprayed inside my eyes and mouth (boy what fun) by the chick, who was shirtless and apparently with no underwear (remember i was sprayed). she then started yelling "rape!" then other people came by (no idea how nobody noticed before i did) and called the police. the chick, shocked, apparently (it took a while for her to actually notice) said she didn't know who it was and couldn't remember since of the whole shock thing. since she couldn't remember really well (i have no idea how) they arrested me, because why not?
so after going to jail, after some pepper spray treatment, they basically hooked me up to a lie detector and told me some questions. now here is the real fuck up. i am the kind of person with a sick twisted personality half the time, so i ended up saying my mind. and since everyone knows lie detectors are garbage, i said stuff like "i did not r*€@ that bitch", (yay mental issues) with a calm face and since i "said" the truth they had me to let me go. so here they see me, now without a job (i got fired for other things, this was just an excuse), and mental issues, and say "it was him!", basically, and started a trail with feminists who said i was the scum of scum (literally) and should be put to jail. the victim, the chick, still couldn't calm down (wow) and still said she didn't see the guy (or girl (and yes still possible)), since it was winter at night. so then my employer (female) ends up showing camera footage showing i was not the guy (which to this day i'm glad) and they let me go.....
but, like i said earlier it didn't end there. so after that was all done i sued the jury (sorry i'm not an expert in law so this sentence might be weird) saying they were biased towards me for about $200,000 in us dollars, i won. so after that happened i had to leave for rumors and stuff. i decided to move back to the us since i earned enough to get by without worrying too much, and now that i got $200,000 more i could do what i always wanted to do, be lazy for a good couple years (i made a lot of more money abroad then just $200,000).

    Here is the summary: heard a commotion, went outside, got sprayed, accused of rape, got $200,000, moved back, being as lazy as i can.

    Here is the article: this actually happened last week. back story….

two or three months ago i saw a girl at the gym while working out. what caught my eye was her hair. we’ll just say she earned the nickname rainbow bright instantaneously. fast forward to that night at the club, same girl spots me and starts talking to me. didn’t know who she was at first but then i recognize the hair so we introduce ourselves, laugh and talk about the gym. i buy her a couple drinks, we dance, and that was it. at the end of the night, i told her to be safe and that i had fun. she said the same. i tell her good night and that was it. fast forward a week and the next friday i'm at the gym. bam rainbow bright. we talk, we laugh, we exchange phone numbers. i offered to work out with her but she said she had to go. she said that she normally works out during the day time and she normally never works out that late, i think it was around 6 at night or something. 

a day or two after i got her number i texted her. good conversation. it was fun talking to her. asked her if she wanted to go get dinner, she said yes and we made plans for sunday. never heard from her that night. didn’t reply to texts or phone calls. the following week i texted her three times throughout the week and got no reply. the next week, i tried calling her. even left a message which i don’t normally do. tried asking her if she wanted to go indoor rock climbing or maybe go-karting. no reply. a week later she texted me back saying hi, how are you, i replied good and asked where she’s been, no reply. the next week after that i tried sending her one last message, nothing. ok clear sign that she doesn’t want to talk to me. should have got it a week ago, but fuck it, move on. deleted her number so i wouldn’t bother her anymore. 

after about three weeks she sent me a text outta the blue about a concert. asked if i was going, because she wasn’t sure if she wanted to go or not. the concert was at the place where we met which i have some ties to. i basically work there and could get in for free if i wanted to.  during some of our conversations we talked about this because she thought that place was my actual day job. i’ll let you connect your own dots. told her i wasn’t going, and to have fun if she decided to go. she didn’t reply. it’s been about a month 

the fuck-up

so recently my contacts have been fucking with my eyes. last week they really started to fuck with me so i took them out to play destiny (just got to 350 ll) and then i went to the gym. it was about 10 at night. there were two girls that walked in behind me who i held the door open for. a blonde in a green shirt and a brunette. the brunette was nice and very cheery while the blonde just sorta hung back and was quite. me with no contacts, i can’t see shit. but i recognized the brunettes figure as a girl i normally see at the gym. she’s really nice and we’ve exchanged eye contact a few times in the past. 

while i’m on the bench press, they’re on the cable machine behind me doing leg lifts or whatever they’re called. but they don’t have the right equipment. i decide to get the ankle wraps and bring it to them. i go over to the brunette first and asked if she wanted to use it. she was really excited so i asked if she knew how to put it on, she said no but she’s seen people use them on youtube before. i asked if she wanted me to put it on her and she said yes. i go to the blonde to offer the same thing but she just extended her hand and seemed like she just didn’t really want me coming near her. so i handed it to her and off i went. end of the night, i’m finishing up abs and legs while they finish the stair machine. the entire time i was thinking that maybe this was the right time to talk to the brunette. at least ask for her name. but i don’t like interrupting anyone’s workout since i hate when people interrupt mine. so i decided that if they were still there when i’d finished, i’d talk to her. well, luck would have it, they finished and were leaving while i was on my last set. though they were walking incredibly slow. i joked with myself that they were waiting for me. so finished with legs and off to the mats to finish my abs. i get a text message from rainbow bright.

her: oooooook? 

me: what? ok what? you ok?

her: nvm [] [] [] [] [] (i have a flip phone so emojis come through as empty boxes. i’m guessing they were angry faces)

her: are you serious?

me: i have no idea what’s going on right now. did i text you on accident or something or are you trying to text someone else. 

her: i just saw you at the gym and you didn’t say anything to me!

me: what? really? i’m so sorry. where you the girl in the green shirt? what the hell did you do to your hair? i’m sorry i don’t have my contacts in so i can’t see shit. i’m sorry if i annoyed you. 

her: no it’s fine. you didn’t annoy me (when a girl says its fine, you fucked up)

me: are you still here?

her: no i already left. 

me: ok well i’m sorry. i feel bad since i never get to talk to you but the one time i see you at the gym i don’t say anything to you. ma bad. for what it’s worth i’m sorry and i hope i can make it up to you. 

after i got kicked outta the gym so they can close i walked out to my car and re read all the text messages and had a serious talk with myself. seriously, what the fuck is wrong with me. this random chick blew me off for three months. stood me up, and tried to use me to get tickets to go to a concert. then continued to ignore me. then the one time i don’t say anything to her at the gym she gets mad. i was disappointed in myself and felt like shit the rest of the night. not because i didn’t talk to her, but because i acted like a bitch. that was the fuck up. why on god’s green earth did i respond at all? then i laughed at how funny it would have been if i started hitting on her friend right there in front of her.

    Here is the summary: – chick that flaked on my multiple times and stood me up, got pissed off at me for not talking to her at the gym because i wasn’t wearing my contacts.

after i got kicked outta the gym so they can close i walked out to my car and re read all the text messages and had a serious talk with myself. seriously, what the fuck is wrong with me. this random chick blew me off for three months. stood me up, and tried to use me to get tickets to go to a concert. then continued to ignore me. then the one time i don’t say anything to her at the gym she gets mad. i was disappointed in myself and felt like shit the rest of the night. not because i didn’t talk to her, but because i acted like a bitch. that was the fuck up. why on god’s green earth did i respond at all? then i laughed at how funny it would have been if i started hitting on her friend right there in front of her.

    Here is the summary: The fuck-up: I responded to her text message despite not knowing what she was talking about.

    Here is the article: this actually happened last week. back story….

two or three months ago i saw a girl at the gym while working out. what caught my eye was her hair. we’ll just say she earned the nickname rainbow bright instantaneously. fast forward to that night at the club, same girl spots me and starts talking to me. didn’t know who she was at first but then i recognize the hair so we introduce ourselves, laugh and talk about the gym. i buy her a couple drinks, we dance, and that was it. at the end of the night, i told her to be safe and that i had fun. she said the same. i tell her good night and that was it. fast forward a week and the next friday i'm at the gym. bam rainbow bright. we talk, we laugh, we exchange phone numbers. i offered to work out with her but she said she had to go. she said that she normally works out during the day time and she normally never works out that late, i think it was around 6 at night or something. 

a day or two after i got her number i texted her. good conversation. it was fun talking to her. asked her if she wanted to go get dinner, she said yes and we made plans for sunday. never heard from her that night. didn’t reply to texts or phone calls. the following week i texted her three times throughout the week and got no reply. the next week, i tried calling her. even left a message which i don’t normally do. tried asking her if she wanted to go indoor rock climbing or maybe go-karting. no reply. a week later she texted me back saying hi, how are you, i replied good and asked where she’s been, no reply. the next week after that i tried sending her one last message, nothing. ok clear sign that she doesn’t want to talk to me. should have got it a week ago, but fuck it, move on. deleted her number so i wouldn’t bother her anymore. 

after about three weeks she sent me a text outta the blue about a concert. asked if i was going, because she wasn’t sure if she wanted to go or not. the concert was at the place where we met which i have some ties to. i basically work there and could get in for free if i wanted to.  during some of our conversations we talked about this because she thought that place was my actual day job. i’ll let you connect your own dots. told her i wasn’t going, and to have fun if she decided to go. she didn’t reply. it’s been about a month 

the fuck-up

so recently my contacts have been fucking with my eyes. last week they really started to fuck with me so i took them out to play destiny (just got to 350 ll) and then i went to the gym. it was about 10 at night. there were two girls that walked in behind me who i held the door open for. a blonde in a green shirt and a brunette. the brunette was nice and very cheery while the blonde just sorta hung back and was quite. me with no contacts, i can’t see shit. but i recognized the brunettes figure as a girl i normally see at the gym. she’s really nice and we’ve exchanged eye contact a few times in the past. 

while i’m on the bench press, they’re on the cable machine behind me doing leg lifts or whatever they’re called. but they don’t have the right equipment. i decide to get the ankle wraps and bring it to them. i go over to the brunette first and asked if she wanted to use it. she was really excited so i asked if she knew how to put it on, she said no but she’s seen people use them on youtube before. i asked if she wanted me to put it on her and she said yes. i go to the blonde to offer the same thing but she just extended her hand and seemed like she just didn’t really want me coming near her. so i handed it to her and off i went. end of the night, i’m finishing up abs and legs while they finish the stair machine. the entire time i was thinking that maybe this was the right time to talk to the brunette. at least ask for her name. but i don’t like interrupting anyone’s workout since i hate when people interrupt mine. so i decided that if they were still there when i’d finished, i’d talk to her. well, luck would have it, they finished and were leaving while i was on my last set. though they were walking incredibly slow. i joked with myself that they were waiting for me. so finished with legs and off to the mats to finish my abs. i get a text message from rainbow bright.

her: oooooook? 

me: what? ok what? you ok?

her: nvm [] [] [] [] [] (i have a flip phone so emojis come through as empty boxes. i’m guessing they were angry faces)

her: are you serious?

me: i have no idea what’s going on right now. did i text you on accident or something or are you trying to text someone else. 

her: i just saw you at the gym and you didn’t say anything to me!

me: what? really? i’m so sorry. where you the girl in the green shirt? what the hell did you do to your hair? i’m sorry i don’t have my contacts in so i can’t see shit. i’m sorry if i annoyed you. 

her: no it’s fine. you didn’t annoy me (when a girl says its fine, you fucked up)

me: are you still here?

her: no i already left. 

me: ok well i’m sorry. i feel bad since i never get to talk to you but the one time i see you at the gym i don’t say anything to you. ma bad. for what it’s worth i’m sorry and i hope i can make it up to you.

    Here is the article: as a beginning longboarder i thought it was a good idea to bomb down a steep hill-after a rainstorm :|    which didnt end well...
you see in my head it was a good idea at the start until i reached the top of the hill in which by that time i made the conclusion that it was a mistake .
but you see, instead of calmly walking down the hill and boarding somewhere else- i said "fuck it, i'm bombing this"
so there i went; hopped onto my trusty new steed with all new wheels and bearings, proceeding down the hill picking up speed. i knew what the consequences were and how it could go down. 
halfway down the hill i passed a cop-shop, the hill was named cop-shop hill and was made famous for us youngsters as "piggy's death trap" because of the sharp right turn halfway down.
by this time going around 10 kph picking up speed.
the corner was no problem for me because i've rode down it a few times and i know where the grippy part of the rode is. unfortunately though at the end of the turn i got into a tiny wobble but luckily rode out of it; by this time i was going at least  30kph. 
but the killer was when i noticed flashing blue and red lights up ahead of me 200m - cops. 
by this time i was thinking "shit, it would suck if i wiped out in front of a cop. i will move to the left a bit to pass him, try not to spook him". 

that thought was the final nail driving into my coffin...

because when i moved to the right i started a speed wobble.
this time was different because i could not stop it,  all i could do was try and adjust myself to counter it. it didn't help; the speed and wetness of the road made it impossible to get out of, all i could do was bail
so, i  did making me eat mad-thriving shit; shoulder first into the wet, rough, asphalt. 
i slid at least 5 metres, knee-first to make a nice road rash. my phone flew from my hands and my wallet somehow flew out of my pocket, sprawling onto the road. to add the cherry on top, all of this happening in front of this cop. 
after recovering quickly from the tumble i chased my board and eventually slowing down from gravel on the side. 
after that i ran up the hill to collect  my belongings that were scattered across the road. 
i jumped onto my board again and very slowly made my way down the last quarter of the hill. 
the cop though didn't give a shit though so i'm not sure if he seen it so i got that going for me!
lessons learned here is to never bomb a wet hill unless you are feeling way too cheeky. just don't. 

my war wound was not as bad as i expected so i got  another thing going for me!

    Here is the article: tifu: okay let's get this started, so i woke up this morning with the rare wake and bake i'm like meh we ain't doing shit today in class anyways what's the worst can happen, without realizing i totally forgot i had an presentation about i had an presentation about windows the next day(i go to school for cnt), so i walked into class with my blazed self my teacher(a little background he used to be an detective for the local police department) announces who want to go first presenting, the class was dead silent so after waiting an min or so for a response so he says pick an number between 1-24 so a few classmates picked a number and it was my turn so thinking in my head "i got this pshh" i picked number 11... with my shitty luck he said "you sir got the honor of going first"

and that's when my heart dropped to the floor i was panicking inside my head "oh shit man i'm too high for this shit he and my classmates going to know that i'm high as a kite" i'm an shy and awkward guy when it comes to pubic speaking and in general so it didn't help at all so i started with my presentation with a rough start my voice was shaky and i was stuttering a lot, so about a quarter in my presentation he started asking question's about my slide for example i had something about biometrics and if i didn't know the question to it he roasted the shit out of me.

and then the worst my full screen power-point won't stop tabbing out out of full screen in my head i'm screaming in my head "out of the fucking day's my laptop is mocking the shit out of me right now un-fucking real" so every 20 sec it keeps going out of full screen, i feel so defeated i just wanted to roll up into a ball in the corner so after the roasting is finally over my teacher says oh you did alright just be more prepared next time. "in my head i'm like really dude really smh"

but i did feel a lot better once he roasted my other classmates so i wasn't the only one in the same boat :)

    Here is the summary: i waked and baked before class and forgetting i had an presentation in front of the whole class and my teacher roasted the shit out me on top of that my laptop mocked me by keeping exiting out of full screen during my presentation.

    Here is the article: tifu: okay let's get this started, so i woke up this morning with the rare wake and bake i'm like meh we ain't doing shit today in class anyways what's the worst can happen, without realizing i totally forgot i had an presentation about i had an presentation about windows the next day(i go to school for cnt), so i walked into class with my blazed self my teacher(a little background he used to be an detective for the local police department) announces who want to go first presenting, the class was dead silent so after waiting an min or so for a response so he says pick an number between 1-24 so a few classmates picked a number and it was my turn so thinking in my head "i got this pshh" i picked number 11... with my shitty luck he said "you sir got the honor of going first"

and that's when my heart dropped to the floor i was panicking inside my head "oh shit man i'm too high for this shit he and my classmates going to know that i'm high as a kite" i'm an shy and awkward guy when it comes to pubic speaking and in general so it didn't help at all so i started with my presentation with a rough start my voice was shaky and i was stuttering a lot, so about a quarter in my presentation he started asking question's about my slide for example i had something about biometrics and if i didn't know the question to it he roasted the shit out of me.

and then the worst my full screen power-point won't stop tabbing out out of full screen in my head i'm screaming in my head "out of the fucking day's my laptop is mocking the shit out of me right now un-fucking real" so every 20 sec it keeps going out of full screen, i feel so defeated i just wanted to roll up into a ball in the corner so after the roasting is finally over my teacher says oh you did alright just be more prepared next time. "in my head i'm like really dude really smh"

but i did feel a lot better once he roasted my other classmates so i wasn't the only one in the same boat :)

    Here is the article: first some back story. i was just hired as an intern for my school district as one of two pilots for this brand new student internship program that the superintendents set up. we were hand selected by our district superintendents and placed in the technology department to work as summer help. we started monday of this week.
when technology comes into work, we have a separate back entrance in our main administrative building for easy access. note that we can't see the front of the building when coming into work.
this morning i woke up early and got ready early so i could come in to work about 20 minutes early like a good intern. as i walk from my car to the back door, i notice that the hall lights are out, but i didn't mind because i thought custodial hadn't gotten around to turning them on. i scan my badge, the door opens, and i start on my way to the office. right as i reach out to grab the door handle, i hear beeping. i turn around and it's the alarm system that i didn't know existed. it wanted a code (which i didn't have). so i run down the hallway to the front of the building where reception is. it's completely dark. i look out the glass facade of the building and see every parking lot completely empty. by now he actual alarm has started ringing like i had robbed a bank and the police were on there way. i realized i was screwed so i just walked out the front door and waited for the police, or someone, to arrive. after a few minutes, several cop cars showed up and all of the officers got out to check the disturbance. i had to give them my badge and they questioned me. after a while, one of my coworkers showed up and disabled the alarm. as it turns out, a limited number of tech employees work on fridays and we're the only ones in the building for the entire day. none of my bosses were here today which was good. but come next monday, i think i'll have to meet with my boss and the technology superintendent to get this cleared up.

    Here is the summary: i started an internship this week and wasn't told there was an alarm. so when i showed up early to work this morning, it went off and called the cops.

    Here is the article: like most posts, this happened a couple weekends ago. 

i just moved into a new place, and naturally, i invited a few of my close friends over for some drinks. the day before they came over, i had just gotten a couple 3 months old kittens.

everything was going great until the very loud drunk people started to scare the kittens. i thought it was best to leave them in my bedroom with food and water, and leave the door closed so they would feel more safe. 

here's the part where my drunk brain wasn't thinking clearly. i had a spare tv on the floor of my bedroom i was going to sell to a friend, but i thought it was a bad idea to leave it there with the kittens in the room. i moved it to the floor in the 2nd bathroom, which is through the bedroom. brilliant, right?! the tv will be safe from the kittens, and it's out of the way of drunk people. 

an hour goes by and one of my friends asks if i have a second bathroom he could use. being a good host, i tell him he can use the one through the bedroom. only... i forgot i put the tv in there, and of course, he steps on it... twice.

    Here is the summary: don't trust drunk decisions or you'll end up with footprints on your tv.

    Here is the article: tifu, in my major at college we have to do a huge semester long group project. as it is rather stressful you naturally get close to your group members. one particular guy in my group had gotten rather close to me and we started to hang out and naturally i started to develop feelings for him and we started to hang out more and more. we would see each other everyday and if we didn't we would text all day. sounds great right? no.

so this past monday came around and it was my 22nd birthday. i wasn't planning on doing anything crazy but go out and have a couple of drinks with friends. in true fuckup fashion i proceed to get black out drunk. i decided that i needed to go home so myself my gay best friend and the guy in question. 

while waiting for an uber i decide that i am extremely infuriated with this young man and decide to scream at him that i have liked him this whole semester. he looks at me confused. says we will talk about this later and gets in the car.  

the next day i hear nothing from him until around 8pm. we talk for a bit about how fucked up i was and he said he was worried that something would happen to me. i was overjoyed. it seemed that he had forgotten about the whole encounter. the day after this he texts me asking to hang out. i agree and he comes to my house and we decide to go to hookah. 

while we were smoking hookah naturally we start talking about monday and i casually bring up that i only regret one thing from that day. he said i know what it is. we then begin to discuss what happened and he basically tells me that he cherishes our friendship more than anything and he doesn't really have any close friends like me to talk to about life and such. he doesn't want to lose me as a friend just because of feelings. i tell him we can play this 1 of 2 ways. either we can not talk for a week and i can get over him or we can continue hanging out and casually see where this takes us. we make plans to hang out the next 2 days. then we find out a mutual friend of ours had taken his life and we stay up late into the night talking about life, death, the universe while looking at the stars on an outlook. sounds great right? no.

thursday afternoon comes around and i haven't heard from him at all that day. i text him around 6pm about our plans to go out. he said he'd probably show up. i go to the event and hang out with some of my friends. i catch up my best female friend on what happened. but another mutual friend of ours overheard and basically yelled at me for even liking him. i get distracted by alcohol and dancing and forget about this encounter until i see the mutual friend outside of the bar talking to the guy. 

i walk outside and she tells me he wants to talk to me to finish our conversation. she leaves and he looks at me and says that he doesn't want to lead me on and that he's not ready for anything right now. i said i know and basically was very confused on what happened. i leave him and go back inside. next thing i know i see him run out of the bar and not tell anyone he was leaving. haven't heard from him since.

    Here is the summary: got drunk, yelled at my best friend i liked him, talked about it and decided to see where things went. mutual friend over hears conversation and attacks guy to tell me his true feelings. guy runs away and is awol. halp.

while we were smoking hookah naturally we start talking about monday and i casually bring up that i only regret one thing from that day. he said i know what it is. we then begin to discuss what happened and he basically tells me that he cherishes our friendship more than anything and he doesn't really have any close friends like me to talk to about life and such. he doesn't want to lose me as a friend just because of feelings. i tell him we can play this 1 of 2 ways. either we can not talk for a week and i can get over him or we can continue hanging out and casually see where this takes us. we make plans to hang out the next 2 days. then we find out a mutual friend of ours had taken his life and we stay up late into the night talking about life, death, the universe while looking at the stars on an outlook. sounds great right? no.

thursday afternoon comes around and i haven't heard from him at all that day. i text him around 6pm about our plans to go out. he said he'd probably show up. i go to the event and hang out with some of my friends. i catch up my best female friend on what happened. but another mutual friend of ours overheard and basically yelled at me for even liking him. i get distracted by alcohol and dancing and forget about this encounter until i see the mutual friend outside of the bar talking to the guy. 

i walk outside and she tells me he wants to talk to me to finish our conversation. she leaves and he looks at me and says that he doesn't want to lead me on and that he's not ready for anything right now. i said i know and basically was very confused on what happened. i leave him and go back inside. next thing i know i see him run out of the bar and not tell anyone he was leaving. haven't heard from him since.

    Here is the summary: I got black out drunk on my 22nd birthday and screamed at the guy I liked about my feelings.

    Evaluation Criteria:
    1. Read the news article carefully and identify the main topic and key points.
    2. Read the summary and compare it to the news article. Check if the summary covers the main topic and key points of the news article, and if it resents them in a clear and logical order.
    3. Rate the summary with 5 percentages, where each one represents how likely the summary is going to get a score from 1 to 5. For example, if you think the summary is 80% likely to get a score of 5, 10% likely to get a score of 4, 5% likely to get a score of 3, 3% likely to get a score of 2, and 1% likely to get a score of 1, you should rate the summary as 80, 10, 5, 3, 2.

    Here is the article: this weekend i was visiting my friend at his university and us and a few other guys decided to go to a bar with a packed dance floor. we waited in line for over an hour to get in because it was frost week, which is the first week back in school after winter break. once we got in i got settled and danced to the music and ordered a couple drinks. i had already pre-drank with my friends prior so suffice to say i was pretty intoxicated. i saw the bar photographer taking pictures of people so i asked if she could get a pic with me and my friends. later on in the evening i saw the same girl without her camera and asked her if she was the photographer i saw earlier. she nodded and we started having a pretty good conversation. i could tell she was into me and i started harbouring thoughts that maybe i'd get lucky on this fine saturday night. after talking for a bit she told me that she had made $150 for about an hour of work. without thinking i say, "wow that's like the same as a prostitute." the funny thing is i didn't realize what i said was bad at the time. she gave me a dirty look and said, "how do you know how much prostitutes make?" and "photography isn't easy it's hard work." i tried defending myself still oblivious to my mistake until she basically asked me to leave. i went to my friend and told him the story and realized after his face palm that i fucked up. the next morning i laughed about it.

    Here is the summary: i told a pretty girl who was the bar's photographer that her salary was comparable to that of a prostitute. i went home alone that night.

    Here is the article: i was at the petrol station earlier this evening with the mother, picked up a couple of snacks and waited to pay. little back story here: i have been taking some meds which make my face itch, it comes on unexpectedly. 

so we queue and of course the itching starts. no casual rub of the nose, disguised as a sexy hair toss, could relieve me. my face meat burned with the heat of one million oiled woks. i felt like icarus, if only he had merrily flow face first into the sun into a fucking poison ivy field. 

naturally i began to claw myself. i could taste jesus' warm embrace. oh the relief! but then a sharp pinch. 'ssssssh jesus. don't sass me now' i thought to myself. nope, it was my mother. everyone in the petrol station had seen my whole performance. the first thing that came to mind to defend myself was 'don't worry i'm not a meth head' 

it didn't go down very well. everyone was silent no one would give us eye contact. won't be going back there for a while.

    Here is the summary: nobody panic because i'm not a meth head (honestly, i double dog promise)

i hiked deeper into the woods, found a beautiful peaceful spot, sun was shining, birds were chirping, found a spot and let go all of last nites tom yum and green curry....thats when the horrors began, the moment i pooed, everything which flew, hopped, skittered made a beeline for me, bottle flies, horseflies, honey bees, you name it they came, all landed on the delicious concoction below me, as i stared at the moving black mess of insects and tried not to gag, i realized i still had to clean myself, and the moment i moved, the swarm of nurgle would fly up and land...all..over...me. everytime i moved, they would fly and resettle their filthy poo legs all over me, twice they landed on my butt hole, could tell it was a bee cos it was fuzzy.  

as i stumbled away from the evil mess i left behind, i didnt notice the  foot deep hole ahead, left foot went in and "krr..krcck" twisted my ankle, not wanting to ask for help, i had to stumbled my way back to my group

    Here is the article: disclaimer: happened a week ago.


i go to a catholic school, and this catholic school uses the "content keeper" system (it blocks "inappropriate material"). well about 6 weeks ago it unblocked practically everything, including discord
now me and all my friends have discord
so we make a server called "sfx republic" (sfx is an abreviation for our school)

now there is this kid called "phil" (not his real name who nobody likes, phil is a textbook sociopath and/or naraccist. he has a history of befriending then betraying people, he never sees fault in himself, and considers himself to be the best person ever. an all around dick.

he joins this server, now we are sprouting offensive memes. and inviting more people until around 20 - 25 people have joined
someone creates an nsfw channel (remember, catholic school, we all have discord on our school laptops)
now this phil guy, for around a week and a half, he is practically non stop using the bot in the nsfw channel. it's kinda weird, other people also occassionally post stuff
this guy posts porn outside of the nsfw channel, which is a permanent ban. he comes back, banned again, so on and so forth, because he kept stealing one of the admins laptops in class and unbanning himself
this goes on for a while and shit is normal besides this for about a week
then, me and another admin, decided to destroy the server, because nothing is being done but racism, sexism, memes and porn
we remove everything, everyone is pissed with me for actually going through with it (besides the other admin)
now i leave for a week, and then rejoin a week later, get given moderator (now the only admin is the owner). in the middle of science, a friend whom we call "canada" because is canadian, is taken out of class by our year co-ordinator. then 20 minutes later he comes into class and starts taking laptops of people on the server (he missed me for some reason)
so everyone is confused and panicking, and it turns out, someone somehow found out about the porn and nsfw stuff
and canada ratted on us when he was required too by our year co (he had no choice)
so some of us talk to our year co eventually and clear up stuff, piling blame on phil because he was the one posting all the porn
as it turns out the conversations people were having were also part of the problem
(thankfully i never used that discord besides banning that phil guy)
and so basically they go through all this evidence and look at stuff, printing some out
when this situation happened at first, they called the police
because possessing and distributing porn as/too a minor is illegal in australia
and so it basically goes on like this for half a week
people are confused scared, rumours run rampant about suspensions, expulsions, laptop reimaging

and so eventually today, we had a meeting with the year co, he lecutered us (remember, catholic school) and all the normal stuff. he let's the people who did practically nothing free (i was included in this thankfully) but quite a few of my friends and the other two admins are punsished by a laptop reimaging.

we were told that if anything like this happened again we would be really fucked
and so basically, now the kids who were punished have community service (unrecorded) with the school in the it department.(edited)
most of them don't consider this punishment
but the phil kid, we don;t know what is happening with him
(i might update if i find out)

    Here is the summary: so basically, our discord almost got 20+ people suspended/expelled or even arrested and charged because of porn distribution, racism/sexism and all the normal 4chan meme bullshit.

    Here is the article: disclaimer: happened a week ago.


i go to a catholic school, and this catholic school uses the "content keeper" system (it blocks "inappropriate material"). well about 6 weeks ago it unblocked practically everything, including discord
now me and all my friends have discord
so we make a server called "sfx republic" (sfx is an abreviation for our school)

now there is this kid called "phil" (not his real name who nobody likes, phil is a textbook sociopath and/or naraccist. he has a history of befriending then betraying people, he never sees fault in himself, and considers himself to be the best person ever. an all around dick.

he joins this server, now we are sprouting offensive memes. and inviting more people until around 20 - 25 people have joined
someone creates an nsfw channel (remember, catholic school, we all have discord on our school laptops)
now this phil guy, for around a week and a half, he is practically non stop using the bot in the nsfw channel. it's kinda weird, other people also occassionally post stuff
this guy posts porn outside of the nsfw channel, which is a permanent ban. he comes back, banned again, so on and so forth, because he kept stealing one of the admins laptops in class and unbanning himself
this goes on for a while and shit is normal besides this for about a week
then, me and another admin, decided to destroy the server, because nothing is being done but racism, sexism, memes and porn
we remove everything, everyone is pissed with me for actually going through with it (besides the other admin)
now i leave for a week, and then rejoin a week later, get given moderator (now the only admin is the owner). in the middle of science, a friend whom we call "canada" because is canadian, is taken out of class by our year co-ordinator. then 20 minutes later he comes into class and starts taking laptops of people on the server (he missed me for some reason)
so everyone is confused and panicking, and it turns out, someone somehow found out about the porn and nsfw stuff
and canada ratted on us when he was required too by our year co (he had no choice)
so some of us talk to our year co eventually and clear up stuff, piling blame on phil because he was the one posting all the porn
as it turns out the conversations people were having were also part of the problem
(thankfully i never used that discord besides banning that phil guy)
and so basically they go through all this evidence and look at stuff, printing some out
when this situation happened at first, they called the police
because possessing and distributing porn as/too a minor is illegal in australia
and so it basically goes on like this for half a week
people are confused scared, rumours run rampant about suspensions, expulsions, laptop reimaging

and so eventually today, we had a meeting with the year co, he lecutered us (remember, catholic school) and all the normal stuff. he let's the people who did practically nothing free (i was included in this thankfully) but quite a few of my friends and the other two admins are punsished by a laptop reimaging.

we were told that if anything like this happened again we would be really fucked
and so basically, now the kids who were punished have community service (unrecorded) with the school in the it department.(edited)
most of them don't consider this punishment
but the phil kid, we don;t know what is happening with him

    Here is the article: this was 2 months or so ago, and it was actually my buddy who brought the beer, but i was with him and it's still a funny story. 


i was visiting my friend in romania this summer, i am a canadian citizen and he is a dual canadian/romanian citizen. we were down in bucharest and he decided to renew his canadian passport while we were in the city. this can be done through the mail, but it's a lot easier to do in person. 


my buddy needed to make change for the taxi ride from the apartment we rented to the embassy, so he ran into a convince store and bought a few cans of beer and put them in his backpack. we grab a cab and head to the embassy. the embassy is in a neighborhood surrounded by other diplomatic residences and offices from around the world, and there is a lot of private security in the area. we head into the gatehouse to the canadian embassy, it's set up kind of like airport security. you show your passport, they take your phone and camera away and lock it up, and then you put your bags and metallic objects through an xray machine. 


his backpack goes into the machine, and they find the beer. they tell us the cans of beer are not allowed in the embassy, and this makes sense. i ask the guard if we can just leave the bag with him (there was absolutely nobody else at the embassy, we were there alone with the staff), but he says he isn't allowed to. he tells my buddy that he should find somewhere to hide it outside, because the paperwork is only going to take a couple of minutes. i could have held onto the bag for him, but i wanted to see the embassy, my tax dollars at work and all that. 


so my buddy heads outside, crosses the street, and tries to hide the bag among the hedges of the building next door while i'm chatting with the guard in the gatehouse. the guard notices something outside, and runs into the street, just as other private security officers come into view surrounding my buddy in the hedges. the canadian embassy guard grabs my buddy and the bag, and brings him back inside. apparently those hedges were the russian ambassador's, and the building across the street was his private residence - and my buddy had just been caught attempting to place a suspicions package in his garden. 



thankfully it was all just a misunderstanding, and nobody went to gulag.

    Here is the article: okay so this didn't happen today so to speak, however very recently (and only now do i find it funny enough to speak about) i fucked up. 
so me and my girlfriend of two years decided a few nights ago that we were gonna do something as an experiment, just to see how those kinda things went and to see if it got us off. we decided to masturbate in the shower over skype. we have a real life relationship but she does live around 3 hours away from me. so seeing her often isn't really an option due to work and college. so around this time i'd not even had "any" for around a month. so i was over the moon she was openly asking me to do some experimental sexy-time stuff with me. at this point i prepare for the shower and before i get on call i quickly bash one out in a few minutes. so getting to the good parts now we're both on the call, video chatting, i've managed to manouver my laptop against the sink and face it towards the shower. i'm home alone and i live with my mum. she was at work around this time so i figured that i'd plan it at least an hour before she came home but also as soon as my girlfriend got home from work so we could get straight to it. we get at it on call with our cameras and at this point i think i bust a nut twice in the space of 30 minutes. so she tells me that we should clean up and keep going in the bed room "great!" i think to myself. i rev myself up for a 3rd round just about and am sitting in my computer chair, half naked. at this point it's appropriate to mention that i hear my mum come home but think to myself "i'm so close to cumming i can get this over with and finish up in time to get changed and say hello to my mother."
as things would turn out the third time round was a lot longer than anticipated. i watched my girlfriend on camera get all sexy and i couldn't look away. at this moment i hear my mum coming up the stairs and know i'm about to be caught. i quickly keep going and ejaculate into my towel, at this moment my mum walks in and i'm dick in hand, next to the laptop in a towel, covered in semen. my mother takes a look at me, almost going into a conversation whilst opening the door and looking at me before leaving abruptly. i was humiliated. my laptop screen was fully visible to her at that angle. she knew what i was doing. my girlfriend was humiliated and at the end of the day i was dumped for being "selfish".

    Here is the summary: fapped with girlfriend on cam in the shower. took it to bedroom. mother caught me and my girlfriend. r.i.p - relationship. :)

as things would turn out the third time round was a lot longer than anticipated. i watched my girlfriend on camera get all sexy and i couldn't look away. at this moment i hear my mum coming up the stairs and know i'm about to be caught. i quickly keep going and ejaculate into my towel, at this moment my mum walks in and i'm dick in hand, next to the laptop in a towel, covered in semen. my mother takes a look at me, almost going into a conversation whilst opening the door and looking at me before leaving abruptly. i was humiliated. my laptop screen was fully visible to her at that angle. she knew what i was doing. my girlfriend was humiliated and at the end of the day i was dumped for being "selfish".

    Here is the summary: I fucked up.

For example, if you think the summary is 80% likely to get a score of 5, 10% likely to get a score of 4, 5% likely to get a score of 3, 3% likely to get a score of 2, and 1% likely to get a score of 1, you should rate the summary as 80, 10, 5, 3, 2.

    Here is the article: like many tifu posts, this didn't actually happen today. this particular event took place when i was in sixth grade. and, i didn't actually feed the duck. the person who fed the duck was a friend of mine who we will refer to as jeff. i was with three other friends who i'll call brian, matt, and josh. i'm just spouting out common names at this point. on with the actual story. 

my sixth grade class was taking an end of the year field trip to a zoo in the city. as with any field trip, this felt like a groundbreaking experience to all of us little sixth graders and we were all very excited. before we got to the zoo, our teachers allowed us to pair up with four other classmates. i immediately got into a group with four of my friends: brian, matt, josh, and jeff. 

when we got to the zoo, we did what people who go to a zoo do. we saw the lions and about every other cool animal around. when lunchtime came around, we went and got lunch at a stand. most of my friends got cheeseburgers or pizza. jeff decided to get chicken nuggets and fries. we sat at a table in an open area around other people. 

a duck popped out of the bushes and curiously approached us. at this zoo, ducks were given the privilege of waddling about and pissing all of the visitors off. this particular duck was friendly enough to approach our table. jeff, being a nice guy, threw a chicken nugget at the duck. while the duck ate his chicken nugget, josh started to yell about ducks being herbivores and not being able to eat chicken nuggets. that didn't seem to stop the duck from eating the whole damn chicken nugget.

while we were arguing about the duck's diet, the duck got hungry again and tried to get more food from us. after ignoring him for a while, the duck quacked at us in the most vicious way it could and started to fly over our table. now, a vicious quack is pretty terrifying. here you have this sweet animal who makes cute noises and now the noises sound vicious and dangerous. it sounded as if the duck was suddenly possessed. the duck was just really pissed off. he was quacking and flapping his wings over us and trying to get the chicken nuggets. a guy who worked at the zoo ran over and grabbed the duck. he pinned the duck down on the ground like a cop and another guy came over and tried to get the duck in a net as we watched in horror. they finally wrestled the duck into the net and dragged it away while it struggled to fight out of its net. the zoo workers weren't at all surprised. they must go through this a few times a day. just a normal day at work.

    Here is the summary: my friend fed a duck a chicken nugget and probably caused the duck to get put down

    Here is the article: this didn't happen today, although i think of it every now and then. that other pizza delivery dude story about chasing the cat reminded me of this memory gem, so i thought i’d share.

i was about 16 and i got a summer job at a local mom & pop's pizza and italian food delivery restaurant. so i show up on time on my first day at 7am like a good kid. i didn't know what job i really even took, but my dad was always telling me to get a summer job so i took whatever would hire me. anyway, i meet the morning crew and get a tour of the place and then the owner (he and his brother were total stoners) shows me to the dishwashing station and tells me i’m in charge of dishes in between delivery orders. so the dishes start coming in and i'm cleaning and this goes on for a couple hours (bonus story: around 9am there’s a knock on the back door and i go to open it and a friend of mine from my old high school is standing in the doorway. he apparently also works at the restaurant (he later became my dealer after this re-connection). this is to say that i became much more relaxed and comfortable knowing i had a friend there). then around lunchtime we get straight, slammed-busy! so many dishes are coming in (final digression- the owner was ~~adamant~~ a total dick about wasting water, so he had me fill the sink with water and wash the dishes by hand without the follow-up rinse with clean water. so as the lunch rush came in, my sink was absolutely filthy. so i told the guy, like let me drain and refill or something, damn! he said no. disgusting! watch where you eat, people). then the delivery orders start coming in and they call me up to make a delivery, only they never actually trained me on the food delivery process. i think the owner never really expected to have me make deliveries but preferred to have me just be the dish bitch, but we got so slammed he had no choice. anyway so the kitchen is crazy, people are yelling, the owner is screaming the address to me with the ever-mandatory, “and hurry back!” so i run to my car, and speed off to the address. i was finally calming down, i was back in my car, and cruising to this office park to hopefully get a big tip when all of a sudden my cell rings. it’s my coworker/buddy from high school, he’s like “uhhh….dude? which order did you take to that office?” shit. i didn’t take a damn thing. i was so eager to gtfo of there and in all the craziness, and i was so nervous (i blame the lack of training) i simply bailed out without taking anything but the address. so i go back to the restaurant, the owner has this look on like, “is this f-ing kid for real?”, grab the order, get to address and the lady says, “where’s my iced tea?” fuck me. drive back to the restaurant, prepare an iced tea (why the hell wasn’t is already made if it was part of the order? is that typically delivery guy’s job to finalize an order with any drinks?), get back to my car and head back to the office. no tip. iirc, somewhere in that timeline my car wouldn’t start. i had an old honda civic that i had to maintain myself which gave me problems occasionally. so i had a hammer and a nine inch nail which i kept at my feet to bang the starter solenoid a few times until it cranked up. so that little excursion didn’t help me make the delivery any faster. i don’t fault the chic for not tipping me.
that was my last delivery for the day. at about 1-1:30pm the owner is like, “okay, thanks. you’re all set.”, and hands me my few hours pay in cash. no other words were exchanged and it was entirely obvious to both parties it was my last day there.

    Here is the summary: took a summer, food-delivery job, forgot to take an order with me on my first-ever delivery, fired with prejudice shortly thereafter

    Here is the summary: I was about 16 and I got a summer job at a local mom & pop's pizza and Italian food delivery restaurant.

    Evaluation Criteria:
    1. Read the news article carefully and identify the main topic and key points.
    2. Read the summary and compare it to the news article. Check if the summary covers the main topic and key points of the news article, and if it resents them in a clear and logical order.
    3. Rate the summary with 5 percentages, where each one represents how likely the summary is going to get a score from 1 to 5. For example, if you think the summary is 80% likely to get a score of 5, 10% likely to get a score of 4, 5% likely to get a score of 3, 3% likely to get a score of 2, and 1% likely to get a score of 1, you should rate the summary as 80, 10, 5, 3, 2.

    Here is the article: obligatory this didn't happen today, but was actually a year or so ago. i was reminded of it last weekend and had to wait for this evening to post. also, this is a throwaway because i don't want this story associated with my name.

my husband and i take turns cooking supper, i cook during the week and he cooks on the weekends. one saturday my husbands friend called and invited him over for beers, bbq and video games. we didn't have any plans and i was fine with some takeout and a quiet night to myself so i told him to go ahead. 

he had already defrosted some meat to cook for supper, so he decided to slow cook it and we would have it in some enchiladas for supper the next night. in order to speed things along for him so he could get going, i decided help him chop the vegetables.

a while after he left, i started feeling a little bored and decided to have some lady time to myself and that's when the fuck up happened. just as i was really getting into things, i started to feel an ungodly burning sensation. then it occurred to me; i had chopped jalapeno's just an hour earlier and while i had washed my hands several times afterwards, i still must have had some of the oils on my hands. i had to, uncomfortably, lay there while the burning built up until it felt like my vagina was sent to hell as a punishment for the fun times i had attempted, and then wait for the pain to go away again. 

 


edit: wow, this got a lot more attention that i expected. i'm glad that you all could enjoy my pain a little! to whomever gave me gold, thank you so much. it's completely unexpected and so appreciated!

    Here is the summary: husband went out for a guys night, i stayed home and ended up having a hot pocket.

    Here is the article: on wednesdays i work in a different location to usual. the trains don't run very often in this location and so when it's cold, i usually take a more complicated route involving a bus and then changing to a tram and swapping in the city centre.

if i time this exactly right, which i normally do, i can completely minimise my skin-to-freezing-cold-air ratio by getting off one tram just as it passes the tram i need to get home at the same stop. i jump off one, cross the street, wait 1-2 minutes for the next one, and perfect. warmth awaits!

anyway, we are having an uncharacteristically cold april, so feeling disgruntled by this, i decided to try my trick. only the first tram was slightly behind schedule, so i could see that the other tram was waiting right there. i could have stayed on and just changed at a later stop, but i was impatient and decided to chance it. i ran around the back of the first tram, stopped to check the second one wasn't about to run me over, and proceeded to trip over what i can only assume was a protruding cobblestone. i sort of felt myself falling in slow motion, you know the moment where you think you're going to catch yourself, realise you're not, and just have time to think "ah fuck this is going to hurt." i lay there on the ground for a second or two and realised that firstly nobody was rushing over to help (probably a good thing in hindsight) and second that i was about to miss the tram. so i jumped up and got on it.

as i sat there and my hands started to bleed i realised i didn't have a tissue or anything to stem the blood and i was starting to feel a little shaky. i also suddenly remembered how much grazes hurt. so this is why i have been walking around for the past two days with my hand out like a really strange person, complaining that my fingers are cold but i can't fit them into my pocket. and sporting a teddybear themed plaster on my knee. i still can't oppose my thumbs on the left hand, which is super helpful. and now i'm realising how old i am, since i am basically a ball of ache the day after, especially in my wrists and thumb muscles. i couldn't even type a post this long until today.

to top things off, my son decided to join in the action today and as we were walking home he was staring so hard at the floor that he walked smack into a cigarette machine and gained a perfect straight line blood blister on his forehead. so at least i know who he takes after.

    Here is the article: my company reimburses me for any car rides i take home when i need to stay late in the office to work (past 8pm). i generally take uber, and for a while, had to print out every receipt at the end of each month to get reimbursed. i stay late in the office a lot, so printing out 20+ individual receipts one at a time (i don't think there's a way to mass print) at the end of every month to submit to my expense department seemed like a big hassle. a couple months ago, one of the girls in the expense department offered to print out the expenses for me if i gave her my uber website login credentials. seemed like an easy way to eliminate an annoying hassle, so i agreed. 

today i found out that uber's website has been displaying incorrect timestamps in the website, which don't match to my emailed receipts or to my phone log. i found out because questions were asked why i was consistently going home at 4am or 5am in the morning. there's a lot of work to do in the office, but not that much. the expense department won't reimburse me until i show them a screenshot of my phone log and an emailed receipt for every ride that looks suspect on the website. also, manager wants to sit down and talk about how i can manage my workload better, which is going to require a lot more explaining than i care to do.

    Here is the article: i don't even know what to title this because i can probably call it "tifu by being born" and it will still ring true. this fuck up keeps going back the more i think about it, and in the end it's mainly because i'm just really fucking stupid. maybe i'll call it "tifu by being stupid?"

i guess i'll start at the end and go backwards. my house is fucked. i'm a 20 year old with no college living with my divorced mom with a best friend the same way and the reasons we can't move out is because we like the extra $400 a month we have not spending it on rent, and he can't decide if he wants a shitty apartment near his crush, or a house to rent. 

but no, the house is fucked. there's a hole in the ceiling above the kitchen, the basement is flooded, and the upstairs smells like diarrhea and vomit because i've recently had food poisoning. my mom is pretty settled on the fact this has happened because i was too lazy to plunge the toilet. well it wasn't plunging, and it kept overfilling, so i'd let it sit and get to a more manageable level before trying again. eventually ran out of time, went to bed, 3 hours later i'm awoken to screaming "thousands of dollars of damage" "thousands of dollars of damage" "all because you're too fucking lazy to plunge the toilet."

oh, did i spoil the fuck up? no it gets better. why did i have food poisoning? because i worked a few shifts for my friend. he owns a security company and works a few events. he hires a few people he knows, including myself, to work them. at said event, i had a couple phillie cheesesteaks that tasted funny before i went to my other job. it's some nice extra cash on the side, but my main job was kind of pissed at it. i work retail loss prevention, and i already suck at it. i can't meet productivity standards, and my boss i'm sure already hates me because apparently explaining her flaws to her friends counts as talking behind her back. my line of thought was "oh you're her friend? i can trust you with my opinion of her, because you'll keep it between her, you, and me." nothing i say to them is something i wouldn't say it to her face, but she still took it as talking behind her back, and in my job field i lost a vital aspect: trust. 

why is this important? because me calling in today to help clean up the mess was the last straw. i was already on thin ice, but i had to call in yesterday from the food poisoning, which they thought was exhaustion because i was on my 34th straight work hour (but i've worked longer shifts at my old security job and never felt that bad), and calling in two days in a row is because of a "conflict with another job" even though it's only a 3 day long temp event. my mom was also freaking out because she's out of pto and afraid she'll get cut now. i get her taking her anger out on me, but i just want to sleep. i've been sick, overworked, and in 4 days, i've only had the last 3 hours of sleep, working 2 jobs, and hey, i made 1 thing count down.

so yeah, reddit; today my fuck ups caught up to me. now excuse me while i probably get fuck up again trying to clean this mess up.

 

update! my mom's friends are convincing her to kick me out.

    Here is the summary: i lost my job, ruined my mom's house, lost a lot of sleep, and the reason this all cascaded was because i got food poisoning.

    You will be given one summary written for a news article. Your task is to rate the summary based on the following criteria:
    Output format: PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE

    Evaluation Criteria:
    1. Read the news article carefully and identify the main topic and key points.
    2. Read the summary and compare it to the news article. Check if the summary covers the main topic and key points of the news article, and if it resents them in a clear and logical order.
    3. Rate the summary with 5 percentages, where each one represents how likely the summary is going to get a score from 1 to 5. For example, if you think the summary is 80% likely to get a score of 5, 10% likely to get a score of 4, 5% likely to get a score of 3, 3% likely to get a score of 2, and 1% likely to get a score of 1, you should rate the summary as 80, 10, 5, 3, 2.

i guess i'll start at the end and go backwards. my house is fucked. i'm a 20 year old with no college living with my divorced mom with a best friend the same way and the reasons we can't move out is because we like the extra $400 a month we have not spending it on rent, and he can't decide if he wants a shitty apartment near his crush, or a house to rent.

    Here is the article: yesterday i wanted to throw a snl 40th anniversary party and a walking dead night for a couple of friends of mine. i need to figure out who to message to come and how much pop, and chairs i need for my basement to seat everyone, now mind it that i'm a 16 year old teenager who has had zero knowledge of being careful, and taking care of shit. so while i was moving chairs in and out of my basement. i was messaging my friends on snapchat telling them what to bring and what not. 
        so after about 30 mins. of getting shit ready, and messaging everyone. i forgot that i had left my ipad mini leaning against my sofa. so while i was finally able to relax i went to go sit down i stepped on my ipad and bent it, not to bad but still fucking bent... i flipped shit and didn't what the fuck to do, so i did what any normal teenager would do.... i panicked.... i tried to bent it back to its normal shape but i couldn't since i just nerd who does lift or do sports.... it was still working normally but as soon as my friends started to arrive it wouldn't turn on.... we spent 30% of the night trying to fix my dumb ass mistake. 
         only us to cum to the conclusion that i was fucked... today i've been trying to figure out what the fuck to do, i already told my mom(didn't have the balls to tell my dad yet....), and i've asked a few questions on what the fuck to do on a couple forums. i got the ipad to turn on but that was about a hour ago, and then it went to a blue flashing screen like you would see a computer monitor from the 90's.... now i tried turning it back on, and now its stuck on that shitty apple logo...

    Here is the summary: stepped on ipad mini, now i learned what the kids from the early 90's went threw with shitty computer monitors

    Here is the article: so this happened to me when i was about 9 years old, that's 19 years ago but you will soon find out why i remember it like it was yesterday.

i was in primarily/elementary school and we had a culture where the affluent kids would bring something to share with the class during their birthdays. one of those kids happened to be a friend of mine and he had a really awesome birthday party in class, his mom came with a cake and drinks for everyone, i remember the presentation was very classy and legit. 

fast forward to the day before my birthday. i tell him (rich friend) and two other friends of mine that the next day is my bday and they get all excited but i tell them also not to tell anyone so it doesn't seem like a big deal because i knew we were not rich and my dad was very economical but thoughtful. 

so that evening i asked my dad if he could pull through for me and he was cool with with it, he went to the store and bought a bag of eclairs just enough for the whole class to get at least two each (eclairs was a premium brand of chocolate candy at that time) so i knew i was set. 

the next day, somehow the other kids in my class knew whose bday it was. they were already asking me what i was going to do early in the morning and i told them i just brought some candy to share with the class. long story short some greedy kids ended up convincing me to give them some since they could not wait until lunch time (this was the appropriate time to share your stuff with the class). 

so lunch time came and i realize that i may have made a terrible mistake by letting them eat my éclairs, many kids begged me that i just decided to give the ones who didn't get some by the end of the day. lunch time was over and just before the next lesson started some kids ratted me out to the teacher that it was my bday, i guess maybe because they didn't get their share and they thought i was not going to give them.

so the teacher asked if i had something, i said yes and went to the front of the class and placed the éclaires on her table so she could maybe help me give all or some of the kids. she looked at the bag and to my shock slapped it hard enough to make them scatter all over the class. 

she then told me to pick them up and go back to my sitting position and started the next lesson. i was really messed up and did not talk to my class mates or friends for the rest of the day. i felt so embarrassed to even tell my parents about it. i just consoled myself with the remaining éclairs.

    Here is the summary: rich kid has cool bday party in class, greedy classmates ruin my bday party, teacher was not a good human on that day.

i work in a law office as a law clerk. our office is currently being renovated, and because of that a lot of the desks are in storage. since i am low on the professional totem pole, i'm constantly playing musical chairs for which desk i'm going to sit at each day. 

so this morning i come in to work all psyched because my boss is going to be out at a deposition all morning and i know i'll get to use his desk and office for most of the day. he's super cool with me and has no problem with me using it while he's out. 

i start the morning just like any other: log into my gmail, gchat with some friends about weekend plans, browse reddit and espn for a bit, and make some fantasy baseball moves. around 1pm i go to lunch with some people from the office. 

here's where everything goes to shit. i get back from lunch to find my boss has come back from his deposition early and is at his desk. i walk into his office and offer to move all my things out of the way and log out of my user profile on his computer. at this moment, without saying a word, he stands up, walks around behind me and closes the office door. he starts talking to me about professionalism in the workplace, blah blah blah. after listening for a couple minutes i ask him where this is all coming from. 

turns out, when i logged into chrome on his computer, it also synced all my chrome bookmarks from my laptop. so when my boss, who is not computer savvy in the slightest, got on his computer and saw entries such as "cancer philanthropy" and "paul pierce statistics," he naturally became curious and began clicking them. little did he know that these were my bookmarks from my personal computer. and littler did he know about my strategy of saving all my favorite pornogs as "inconspicuous" bookmark names (because i'm sleuthy as fuck). so when my uber-conservative boss saw a horde of milf pov and dildo double pen cum across the screen, he freaked out. after putting two and two together, i guess he figured out who the culprit was. 

needless to say i am currently on the shitlist. my boss has a meeting with the other firm partner over the weekend, and will likely be discussing whether this newly discovered ava addams enthusiast should remain employed at their firm.

    Here is the summary: logged into google chrome on my boss's computer, synced all my bookmarked porn, boss accidentally opened my fap bank

    Here is the article: tifu reddit. it's not that bad, but it's pretty awkward to say the very least. 

so, i park up at mcdonald's. my other half runs in with her friend to go get some slow food, and take a piss. as she's walking back, she just freezes standing at the side of my car. i look at her face and her and her friend are now gripping each other screaming (they're both a little tipsy, i'm just tired and want to get home to do.. well, anything else). 

i ask her what's the matter. "spider, it's massive". i'm confused and irritated, so i ask where. "the car". i decided to lean over and open the passenger door and tell them they can walk around the car and get in that way, and they won't have to see the spider. they are still being hysterical and laughing and i'm getting more fed up of waiting, plus that damn new garlic chicken wrap is getting colder by the second, and my coke (no ice) is beginning to see a lot of the floor. "nooo it's on the van next to your car!". i'm like, right, fine, let's do this. 

i jump out the car, run around to the passenger side, and see potentially the biggest spider i've seen (in the uk anyway) perched on the van. after making a fuss and wanting to get home, i can't back away now, so with one almighty deep breath, a slight step back, and quick wipe of the brow, i deliver a thunder punch to this spider and watch it fall to the ground, where i casually slide it under the car with my foot and looking like a boss go "come along ladies".

bam. i fall to the floor and the side of my face aches like hell. 3 massive guys, who look angry af (probably fair point), and the leader in a tank top with muscles for days, and tattoos to match, are hovering over me. 
"why the fuck did you just punch my van, you -" (story trails into expletives here).

so all in all, i then spent the next 5 minutes apologising like a toddler, and offering the guy £10, lolwtf, like that would solve the problem, and sounding like a complete pussy in front of the girls, the guys, and the whole car park praying the man wouldn't slap me upside the head again, before getting in my car with an wobbly bottom lip. fml.

    Here is the article: when i wrote this, it literally happened a few minutes ago but i never found myself posting this story so... here we are. it happened last summer around end of july.

i know myself and that my body can't really handle much... especially a lot of heat and all this happened on a really, really hot day. so you'd think i'd be careful. but that's where i fucked up. 

today was a fairly hot day, maybe somewhere in the 90s.. i already woke up with a heavy headache from the weather, stupid me then decided to smoke a hookah with some friends. first one alright, second one already made my head throb and feel horrible... 
taking a break we later decided to smoke a third one. oh boy i should've known better. 
5 minutes into smoking i quit, feeling so horrible all i wanted was sleep. now.... we went to walk outside, play some pokemon go..
at this point it was around 8pm and we had been smoking for the past few hours.

we stumbled upon a small bar after a few minutes and had one cocktail each. i'm not a lightweight, i wouldn't get drunk from one single cocktail. so we go back outside and continue playing pokemon. until we reached a friends house. 
as soon as i entered, i stumbled towards the stairs, sat for a while because the world was spinning around me... realizing that sitting didn't help i layed down on the ground only to notice how my stomach was getting more and more upset.... i jumped up, wanting to run to the bathroom but it was too late and i lost it all over the ground... running to the bathroom now i threw up a little more into the toilet... my entire cocktail emptied itself in front of me into the toilet and on my friends floor...... 

i'm so sorry. she cleaned everything up too which still makes me feel terrible today.

then when i looked up from the toilet, my ears started ringing so loudly.... i began to pour water all over myself, didn't help much as i only remember how i was standing in front of the sink and then... next thing i know, laying on the ground. as i woke up from unconsciousness i felt as if my life was over... leaning against the bathroom wall, trying to get control over myself again. then the lights went out again. again completely laying on the ground. i sat up right and let the water from the sink flow down all over my body but nothing helped. i was about to tell my friends to call the ambulance when the ringing finally got less.. and less..

i sat on the ground breathing heavily, my friend handing me an ice cold glass of water, i must've asked for somewhere in between all of these events... i went to her shower, turned it on cold and sat in there with my clothes on. i went to sleep at her place that night... 

sure enough i didn't smoke hookah for a while after that and i still regret not listening to my body sometimes.
don't do what i do, people.

    Here is the summary: i smoked too much hookah on a hot day, knowing that my body couldn't handle it, which resulted in me vomiting cocktail all over my friends living room and passing out twice on her bathroom floor.

    Here is the article: this happened a few minutes ago, and is much a plea for help as it is a tifu. 

i'm a straight 32 year old male who has been experimenting with leg shaving and other male grooming. yesterday i went to the store to get a waxing kit. 

today i tried to wax the hair off my ass. i got the wax hot, which burnt like a mother when i used the popsicle stick to goop it on my asshole. i put the fly paper on by butt, and let it dry for a minute, and then ripped it off. 

it tore a 1/4 inch of skin like the peel of a grape from my asshole to the little line on my taint. it fucking hurts so bad. 

how do i fix it? i can't really put a bandaid on it. i put some peroxide on it to kill any germs down there and put neosporin.

    Here is the summary: tifu by peeling my asshole like a grape.

    Here is the article: my friend has two daughters, ages 9 and 4, whom i babysit from time to time. tonight is one of those times. 

the 9-year-old is pretty self-sufficient in that she can entertain herself, but her little sister is a handful. and she is obsessed with frozen. she knows the songs, has all the gear and costumes, recently had a frozen-themed birthday party, and occasionally insists on being called elsa. but she'd never actually seen the movie. until tonight. 

it's not that i didn't already know she scares easily, but i figured she'd already read the book and knew the basic plot, and she had told me she really wanted to watch it ("what if there's a really scary part?" "then i'll be scared, but it's ok"), and hell, maybe she'd overcome some of her fears. 
midway through the wolf chase scene, i realized that i had made a huge mistake. she had already cried several times by then, even came close to throwing up, and we hadn't even gotten to the iceman parts yet. but every time i asked if she wanted to stop watching, she shook her head no, and as soon as the scary part was over she was totally into it again. we were most of the way through the movie when she turned to me with big blue eyes and said the words that broke my heart: *i don't like frozen anymore.*

now waiting for her folks to come home. pretty sure i won't be asked to babysit again. 

my husband thinks this is hilarious.

    Here is the summary: decided to show frozen to an elsa-obsessed, but easily frightened, 4-year-old. her last words to me as i put her to bed: "next time bring doc mcstuffin.... no, don't bring anything because you're never babysitting me anymore, ever."

    Here is the article: this actually happened about 12 hours ago. i was outside most of the day cutting up all the tree limbs that had fallen down during a recent storm, and from the storm before that because i procrastinate with the best of them. as a card carrying daywalker, my skin had a healthy shade of steamed lobster. after a long day of sawdust and near misses with the chainsaw, i decided to celebrate my injury free day with a fire. i got my drink and lawn chair all set up. cue fuck up.
     i tried to light the fire a few times but it wouldn't stay lit, so i decided to speed up the process. never start a fire with gasoline kids. i poured some into a cup (because only an idiot would pour it out of the can right?) and told my 5yo to stand back. i started pouring it on what i thought was a completely snuffed fire when foom! the fire ball got me a little bit so i jumped back dropping the cup and sending the remaining gasoline splattering all over my legs and patio. instant liquid fire from toe to waist. i supermanned into the grass and rolled like a champ. i got it out after what felt like an eternity and stood up to the sound of my cheering son saying " daddy you did so good!! they even teach us that in school!!" i smiled and laughed and said hey how about we go find your mom. 
    watching the dr cut away they charred parts of skin was about when the shock wore off and i could feel every last puff of air like jagged nails. 

  you know the part they leave out of the stop drop and roll phase? its where the dr has to use tweezers to get every piece of dirt that you just ground into your second degree burns so you don't get an infection. i don't think that would be as catchy though.

    Here is the summary: used gasoline to restart a fire, became the human torch, rolled around in dirt, and now my sunburns are 2nd degree burns.

    Here is the article: this happened just now.

so, on friday, i had a test in my ap english class. naturally, being known as the classic "good kid" (to keep this reputation, i used a throwaway account :p) i studied for the test. now, before the test, i heard other students lamenting about how they would fail the test, they didn't study, etc. the usual. so then, we took the test, i felt like i did pretty well, and so i thought that would be that.

**nope**

so, i returned to school today, and i went to that class, and the teacher talked to us sternly about a "cheating incident" and that the perpetrator would be in for some ***really big trouble.*** ehh. i had a few suspects in the class, knowing some of them, but surely it could not be me. during lunch period, i was called to the office. usually, when i am called to the office, it's because my parents dropped something off, or i forgot a paper in a class, and just about that. well, when i got to the office, they called me down to the head of discipline's office. i then started to get slightly worried about what happened. as soon as i'm down there, i see the principal and just about the rest of the administrative board. i get sat down and the first thing that he says is...

"i know about your cheating in your classes."

i was very confused. i didn't know what happened. i asked them about what happened, and sure enough, there was a cheating incident in the ap english class and it was pinned on me. apparently, it was because i got a 100 on the test, and the second-highest grade was a 39. i asked them how that proved that i cheated, and they said it was because some of the others were a students and that the test was probably impossible sans cheating.

they called both my parents down, and my parents argued for my side saying that i would never cheat, they need to show the evidence, yeah. they said that even the most unsuspected people can be cheaters and they they have a zero-tolerance policy against cheating and were by faculty policy not allowed to show the evidence. they said that i was so bright and that i had so much potential but i had to cheat and now i went and destroyed it all.

i was then expelled, told to get my shit, and go home. and now i have no chance of getting into my dream college, hell, probably won't get into college at all, won't get a job that pays above minimum wage, essentially, my life is fucked. and now i'm sitting here at my desk in nothing but my underwear playing l4d2 and writing a tifu on reddit.

    Here is the summary: studied for test, got a grade 61 points higher than the next-best student, accused of cheating, expelled, life is probably fucked over, now playing left 4 dead 2 and browsing reddit in my underwear.

    Evaluation Criteria:
    1. Read the news article carefully and identify the main topic and key points.

    Here is the article: this happened about half an hour ago :) i frequently ride my skateboard up to chick-fil-a to get some lunch on saturdays. and today was no exception. i order my food sit down and go to put my straw in my drink (dr pepper), but it wont go in all the way becuase the ice is in the way. normally if you just force it in it'll cooperate, but this straw  was different. i started pushing it down into my drink and moments later liquid starts gushing all over the tray with my food. i'd poked a hole in the bottom of the styrofoam cup -.- and on top of that, i got it on my jeans and shoes both of which were grey. i looked down is shock and dismay, threw the cup away, sorta cleaned up, ate then got the fuck out of there.

    Here is the article: so after i finished opening at my work today, i quickly drove over to my community college for my first class of the week. not wanting to wear khaki's all day, i park and take off my pants in the car. now for me, this is the easier part since everyone loves taking pants off, but putting on my shorts was a tad difficult, and i hate adjusting my driver seat, so i decided to step outside the car to put on my shorts. i hate going barefoot/shoeless on any floor that isn't in a building, so i'm on my tiptoes, bouncing because the asphalt is burning.

as i pull my shorts up, i look up to see a girl pull up next to me, i smile at her, but in this moment of weakness, i lose my footing and begin to fall. naturally my hands grab at something to catch myself before face-planting in front of a relatively attractive person, but the only thing to grab was my boxers. so here i am, smiling like i just had a close-call, and she starts laughing in response. although i realize two seconds later she's laughing at my nether regions, so i look down horrified to find my package unwrapped. i haven't manscaped in a while, nor is my flaccid penis a shower, so i instantly turned around, butt to the world. 

being of asian indian descent, my hairiness is my gift to the world. behold my butt, which quickly became a hairy black hole (google that if you dare) as i bent over to pick up my shorts. realizing that, i turned once more, still bent over, only to show my reverse sinkhole to some mom's and their kids about to watch a school play. i decided the best course of action was to politely wave, pull up my pants, and march to class.

on the flip-side, some kind soul out there returned my iphone after it was stolen in the library, so thanks to that kind stranger.

    Here is the article: i was five years old when this happened. as a child i was very curious so one morning i saw my mom ironing in the living room and when she went to my brothers clothes she said "don't touch this it's really hot." 
she placed it not down but up straight the red hot tip facing me, and went to the couch to grab more clothes. 

here's the fuck up. i'm thinking, it can't be that hot. i looked at my tiny index finger and touched the very tip of the iron. i immediately pulled back and screamed in pain. my mom turned looked at me and started yelling at me with a small grin on her face "i just told you not to touch it!!" she bandaged my finger and that was that. a few weeks later same situation. "don't touch the iron" 
i got this bright idea..

"if it burned my finger it won't burn my lower lip right?" i touched it with my lip and i cried for days. 
for the next week i had a triangular burn on my lower lip.

    Here is the summary: i touched a red hot iron not once but twice after being told it was really hot.

    Here is the article: so this just happened literally 30 mins ago. so my fiancé and i are planning on flying to denver, co for a stress-free, pleasant little getaway for a few days. obviously one of the reasons we chose colorado is for the extra curricular activities you can indulge in while there. anyways, we arrive at the airport excited for our big adventure clueless of what's to come. we check in our bags, go through tsa security, and are waiting in our flight terminal. out of no where i hear my named called over the pa system, "scott, you're needed at the baggage drop-off immediately!". now, if you've never been to an airport it's not often you hear anyones named called over the pa unless it's a serious matter. so, stunned that i heard my named called, rush back to the baggage claim to find out what the issue is. as i'm getting closer i notice 2 cops and a tsa security guy waiting at the desk. at this point you could say i was getting pretty damn nervous wondering what the hell the problem was. when i reach the desk the cop asks, "are you scott?". i agree and then he slides a gun in an holster across the desk towards me. as soon as i seen it i noticed right away it was my fiancé's. he then goes on to say, "this weapon was found in your boots sir, what's your reasoning for this?!". already sweating bullets i stutter, "that's my fiancé's sir and i have no idea how it got there." you could tell by the look on his face he wasn't buying that at all. luckily, my fiancé was with me and she right away explained the whole mishap. apparently last time we went on vacation she thought it would be a good idea to hide her gun in my boots? so the officer kinda buys her story more than mine and then goes on to taking our id's and phone numbers. at this point i'm already thinking the worst - we're gonna get put on the no-fly list, lose our rights to own a weapon, possibly serve time. surprisingly they didn't do anything to me, but fined my fiancé for trying to take a weapon in an airport and on a plane. truth be told they put our pictures and names on tsa's heavy security watch list cause walking back to the terminal we had all kinds of stares and glances by any and all officers and security guards. hopefully this doesn't spoil our romantic getaway and might even get some guilt trip sex for the embarrassment she caused me. just trying to be optimistic i guess. 

btw, this is my first post reddit so be gentle.

    Here is the article: tifu majorly. this actually just happened to me about half an hour ago. excuse any formatting issues. i am on mobile at the moment, so be nice lol.

i do service directing at my church, which means handling quality control of the camera shots and managing the time clock for each specific segment. therefore, i have my own computer in the soundbooth to work from.

i was on vacation this past week, so my station was a bit messy. i threw away a couple of wrappers and noticed that my keyboard had lots of crumbs and dust in the keys, so i grabbed (what i thought was) the dust remover spray. now, in my defense, the soundbooth is pretty dim in the morning before people come in. so it's an honest mistake, right? yeah... anyways, that's where the fuck up happened. turns out i grabbed the wd-40 and sprayed it alll over my work computer's keyboard.

cue instant panicking and googling how the fuck to clean that off without damaging it further. it's clean now, but i'm hoping it's still plenty functional...

    Here is the article: this was only yesterday, but i wasn't able to post then because i was at work and could not devote the time to writing this.

i had posted a question to r/music about uptown funk by mark ronson featuring bruno mars.  i'd found the song via that awesome mash-up video with all the classic hollywood musical clips, and i wondered if there were songs that others could recommend in a similar vein.

i received some very helpful responses which i'm looking forward to listening to this weekend.  i also received some replies that were the exact opposite of useful.  one, in fact, was so negative that i felt compelled to respond, and thus began the fu.

this person suggested that if i wanted songs similar to uptown funk, i could just pour steaming shit into my ears.  now, i know uptown funk is very likely not going to heralded as one of the great dance tunes of the decade, but it's got a good beat and you can dance to it.

i found this persons response needlessly vitriolic and completely uncalled for.  i get it, you don't like the song.  but just because you have an opinion doesn't mean that it must be shared, especially when it wasn't asked for.

so i responded with what i thought was a similar attitude.  perhaps not my proudest moment, but the sneering judgmental attitude expressed by this person just got to me.  i said that i thought that this person had already poured steaming shit in their own ears and now it was coming out of their mouth.  perhaps gargling bleach would clean up the mess.

a half hour goes by at work, and i check in on the thread when i have a free moment and there's a new response, this time from a moderator informing me that i've been banned from r/music.  after inquiring about the ban (even though my suspicions were correct) i was told that "encouraging people to commit suicide would not be tolerated here."

now, i get the ban on a certain level.  i do.  hate speech is the worst kind of static, and it needs to be kept to an absolute minimum.  i don't disagree with the ban.  i confess i was suckered into a feces flinging contest with a chimp.  i got trolled good!

but, i do disagree with the implication that the person who wrote what they did is going to seriously consider doing what i said any more seriously than i would consider doing what they initially suggested to me.  anyways, it doesn't matter.  i don't know how long the ban will last, and honestly i don't care.  i can still come to r/music and all other subreddits and read if i want to, which, like most, is 99% of my time on reddit.

have you even been banned from a subreddit and did you agree?  i still think my situation involves some pretty fine hair-splitting as far as web policing goes, but what do i know?  i guess sarcasm in text form needs a tag or something!

    Here is the summary: told an asshole to bleach the shit out of their sphincter and was banned from a subreddit for "encouraging suicide."

i had posted a question to r/music about uptown funk by mark ronson featuring bruno mars.  i'd found the song via that awesome mash-up video with all the classic hollywood musical clips, and i wondered if there were songs that others could recommend in a similar vein.

i received some very helpful responses which i'm looking forward to listening to this weekend.  i also received some replies that were the exact opposite of useful.  one, in fact, was so negative that i felt compelled to respond, and thus began the fu.

this person suggested that if i wanted songs similar to uptown funk, i could just pour steaming shit into my ears.  now, i know uptown funk is very likely not going to heralded as one of the great dance tunes of the decade, but it's got a good beat and you can dance to it.

i found this persons response needlessly vitriolic and completely uncalled for.  i get it, you don't like the song.  but just because you have an opinion doesn't mean that it must be shared, especially when it wasn't asked for.

so i responded with what i thought was a similar attitude.  perhaps not my proudest moment, but the sneering judgmental attitude expressed by this person just got to me.  i said that i thought that this person had already poured steaming shit in their own ears and now it was coming out of their mouth.  perhaps gargling bleach would clean up the mess.

a half hour goes by at work, and i check in on the thread when i have a free moment and there's a new response, this time from a moderator informing me that i've been banned from r/music.  after inquiring about the ban (even though my suspicions were correct) i was told that "encouraging people to commit suicide would not be tolerated here."

now, i get the ban on a certain level.  i do.  hate speech is the worst kind of static, and it needs to be kept to an absolute minimum.  i don't disagree with the ban.  i confess i was suckered into a feces flinging contest with a chimp.  i got trolled good!

but, i do disagree with the implication that the person who wrote what they did is going to seriously consider doing what i said any more seriously than i would consider doing what they initially suggested to me.  anyways, it doesn't matter.  i don't know how long the ban will last, and honestly i don't care.  i can still come to r/music and all other subreddits and read if i want to, which, like most, is 99% of my time on reddit.

have you even been banned from a subreddit and did you agree?  i still think my situation involves some pretty fine hair-splitting as far as web policing goes, but what do i know?  i guess sarcasm in text form needs a tag or something!

    Here is the summary: I had posted a question to r/music about uptown funk by mark ronson featuring bruno mars.

    You will be given one summary written for a news article. Your task is to rate the summary based on the following criteria:
    Output format: PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE

    Evaluation Criteria:
    1. Read the news article carefully and identify the main topic and key points.
    2. Read the summary and compare it to the news article. Check if the summary covers the main topic and key points of the news article, and if it resents them in a clear and logical order.
    3. Rate the summary with 5 percentages, where each one represents how likely the summary is going to get a score from 1 to 5. For example, if you think the summary is 80% likely to get a score of 5, 10% likely to get a score of 4, 5% likely to get a score of 3, 3% likely to get a score of 2, and 1% likely to get a score of 1, you should rate the summary as 80, 10, 5, 3, 2.

    Here is the article: ok, i'll keep this short. this didn't happen today, rather it happened a few months ago. anyways, i decided to buy some 'toys' online, and get them sent to my boyfriends house, who lives with his parents, because my parents are super nosy and might find the toys, super awkward. as you can tell my the title, things got awkward anyways. a few weeks after ordering online a few packages have come, but i'm still waiting on one last toy. after a few more days, i go over to my bfs house and he starts laughing hysterically, telling me how his mom found one of our packages. she had thought it was something for her because the name was covered up by a sticker and tore into it.. only to discover these huge black colored beads. she wrote me a note saying it was an accident and how sorry she was for opening it. needless to say we never talked about it, but i'm sure it'll come up in the distant future as something we can laugh about together.

    Here is the summary: bought "toys" online, bfs mom finds big black beads, embarrassed forever.

    Here is the article: obligatory this didn't happen today,  but many years ago. 

when i was a kid i just loved to build and climb things,  what little kid didn't at that time. at the time i had a friend that also loved that too, and he lived by a forest that had many tall trees and his own tree fort. 

one day we decided we wanted to rebuild it,  and we made up our minds to do so. first we kicked off the walls, so we could make transporting wood easier. then we threw out a bunch of junk that was up there.  (twigs, bottles and a tile for whatever reason) when i threw the tile out and heard it shatter,  i didn't pay it too much mind. big mistake.

later on when we were going to take a break, he climbed down, and being the super cool daredevil kid i was,  jumped down.  now, the jump wasn't too high, (6-7 feet) but while falling realized i was heading straight for the tile. i tried to redirect myself but i ended up falling onto my knee, getting a tiny chunk of tile stuck in my knee. 

i got up, not realizing it,  and then the pain set in.  it was horrible and it wouldn't stop until i had nudged the chunk out,  and by that time my shin was covered in blood, and the wound kept on bleeding. my friend came over and helped me get into his house. 

once we got inside we couldn't find any bandages, so being the crafty kids we were, put paper towels over it, and wrapped it in duct tape. all the while dribbling blood on the floor.

the worst part of it all was that i had to cycle a mile or so to get back to my house, all the while while blood slows down coming out of my leg. 

nowadays i have a nasty scar to remind me to never mess around when building.

    Here is the summary: jumped off a tree fort, landed on broken tile, and got blood everywhere.
