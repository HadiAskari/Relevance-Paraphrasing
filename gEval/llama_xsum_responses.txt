The summary covers the main topic of the news article, which is the completion of the investigation into the murders of Hannah Witheridge and David Miller in Koh Tao, Thailand. It mentions the involvement of Metropolitan Police detectives, their return to the UK to compile a report, and update the families of the victims. However, it lacks some key points such as the suspects being Burmese migrant workers, the charges they are facing, and the concerns raised by the UK Foreign Office. Overall, the summary presents the information in a clear and logical order.

3713	Poots expressed his reluctance to work with Sinn Féin due to their association with the IRA and past violent activities. Other DUP members also shared similar sentiments but acknowledged the need to work with Sinn Féin for the sake of Northern Ireland's peace. Mr Hamilton, the health minister, faced criticism over the DUP's policy of limited ministerial duties. He plans to resume his duties for one day next week.

The summary covers the main topic of Bradley Lowery's diagnosis with neuroblastoma and the fundraising for his treatment. However, it misses key points such as the update on his cancer growth and the overwhelming support shown through the Christmas cards.

4231	70,000, with 5.3 million non-British residents, 2.9 million of whom are from Europe. Polish nationals make up the largest group, followed by Irish, Romanian, and Portuguese nationals. The UK government is hesitant to give guarantees to EU nationals without similar concessions for UK nationals in the EU. The number of EU nationals working in the UK has increased over the years, while there are about 1.19 million non-UK nationals from outside the EU working in the UK. Just under 1.2 million UK nationals live in the rest of the EU, with Spain having the most UK nationals. The Irish and Polish governments are making contingency plans for their citizens in the UK.

The summary is likely to get a score of 5 (100%) as it accurately mentions the approximate number of EU nationals living in the UK. It is also likely to get a score of 4 (80%) as it fails to mention key points such as the number of UK nationals living in the EU, the breakdown of EU nationalities in the UK, and the changes in the number of working EU nationals over the years. It is likely to get a score of 3 (10%) as it lacks details about the contingency plans of the Irish and Polish governments. It is likely to get a score of 2 (5%) as it does not provide information about the number of non-UK nationals from outside the EU working in the UK. Finally, it is likely to get a score of 1 (3%) as it does not mention the statistics on UK nationals living in different EU countries.

The summary covers the main topic of the article, which is the poster calling for the departure of Massimo Cellino as the owner of Leeds United. It also mentions the reason for the supporters' anger, which is Cellino's failure to sell his share in the club. However, it does not include all the key points mentioned in the article, such as Cellino's agreement to sell his share to Leeds Fans United and the 'pie tax' issue. The summary is clear and presents the information in a logical order.

The summary covers the main topic of the news article, which is the Peruvian army rescuing captives from a Shining Path group in the Amazon region. It mentions the number of captives, their demographics, and the location of the rescue.

8757	60m in damages after a lengthy legal battle. The judge described the evidence against Colm Murphy and Seamus Daly as overwhelming, with both men found liable for assisting in the bombing. The families are determined to pursue enforcement of the damages and hope for criminal prosecutions in the future. Lord Brennan QC stated that the verdict against Murphy and Daly was damning, with no prospects for appeal. The families had previously won a civil case against four men, including Murphy and Daly, but had not received any compensation. Despite appeals, Murphy and Daly were ordered to face a retrial, leading to the recent judgement. The families are now seeking justice and closure after years of legal battles.

The summary covers the main topic and key points of the news article, mentioning the iconic Cold War nuclear warplane, the English Electric Canberra, its final flypast over Woodford Aerodrome near Stockport, where it was built in the 1960s, and the fact that it will be grounded later in the month. The summary presents the information in a clear and logical order, making it highly likely to receive a score of 5. There is a small chance of receiving a score of 4 due to minor details that could have been included, such as the withdrawal of engineering backers and the huge crowds that gathered to catch a last glimpse. The likelihood of receiving a score of 3, 2, or 1 is minimal as the summary effectively captures the main points of the news article.

The summary covers the main topic and key points of the news article, presenting them in a clear and logical order. It accurately mentions the iconic Cold War-era nuclear warplane, its manufacturing location, the reason for being grounded, and the crowds gathering to see it for the last time. The only minor issue is the lack of mentioning the specific time of the plane crossing the aerodrome, which is why it is rated slightly lower on the second percentage. Overall, the summary is highly likely to receive a score of 5.
