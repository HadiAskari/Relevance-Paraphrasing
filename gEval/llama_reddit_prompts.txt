    Here is the article: this actually happened today. i just got back from the er just a little bit ago. 

so i was out in the yard clearing some brush and burning it off. the fire was crackling nicely and i was using my fancy gransfors bruks small forrest axe to break down branches and practice a little bushcraft. 

i had been at it for a while when the missus hollered at me that chow was ready. i looked up at her and back to yeah branch i was working on and split it enough to throw on the fire. 

here's where the fuck up happens. 

i grab half of the branch in my left hand and, in my rush, keep hold of the axe in my right. i flip the branch into the fire casually with my left and bonk it into what i assume is the handle of the axe. 

stupid move, but no big deal, right?

wrong. 

the thing about a gransfors is that they are razor sharp. i had slammed the knuckle of my left thumb directly into that razor sharp blade. 

i looked down at my thumb and there was a simple red line. again i thought no big deal. then i wiggled my thumb to test it and that line opened like a mouth. 

right away i thought, "stitches," because you don't normally get to see your tendons and bones and stuff. 

it started bleeding, i applied a bandage and pressure and went directly to the er. 

luckily it only took a few hours and five stitches but i learned (relearned?) a valuable lesson: sharp blades and your own skin are a bad combination. 

here's some pics and description because i know you sick fucks want to see inside me (spoiler none of the shots captured the severed muscle and bone and shit)

as stated above, i'm bored (i feel that is very important to my really stupid incident) and i looked into skype bots a bit. there were forums that i even read of peoples conversations!!! so, i decided i was going to be this hilarious guy and update the thread with my own conversation. in one of my replies, i actually copied and pasted the bot's link back to the bot.

fast forward roughly and hour and i go on facebook and see a funny video my gf sent me. it's fucking hilarious. so i went to send her my own funny link (as we do frequently) and i guess i never had the copy command down. i freaked the fuck out. "don't click that link!!" i said. "please for the love of all that is holy don't click that link."

we'll we're all humans and she clicked the damn link.  she hasn't responded and probably thinks i love copying and pasting porn links into my super secret porn notepad.

    Here is the article: you know when you write an email, write it, but don't send it because its overly harsh? today i possibly fucked up?? little back story here. i am a college student and for one of business writing courses, we are to write a complaint letter to a company.

yesterday, i attended a conference on leadership for my college and it was run kinda poorly. so, with that in my mind, i decided to write my complaint letter. here it is verbatim, obvious stuff omitted, but help; did i fuck up??? 



"to whom it may concern:

this is not going to be brief. i had a wonderful time at this year's conference. however, i had some gripes with how some things were conducted. it starts with effective communication between all staff to be able to relay relevant information to your audience in the first place. this is not a lambasting of any sort but a constructive criticism which i do hope is read and taken into account for next year; as i said before, i thoroughly enjoyed the event as a vehicle to connect with new, like-minded people.

the wifi issue. having proper internet access and wifi was made integral for a number of things such as these surveys and to better encourage social media use for the conference. i speculate the surveys in particular did not reach an ideal response count because of this. i digress that it was made clear from the onset that attendees needed to be on the wifi network and not to just keep them from asking about it. 

the problem first arose during the beginning of the day briefing in the auditorium. we were told to select an open network z (this may not be the exact name, but it is close) and shown the slide with the login details. as recalled, there was an uproar over errors and general discontent over an improperly working network. this was a non-consequential afterthought in my head at that moment as i figured it was better that we would be more engaged with each other than our phones. i was wrong because of how communication was conveyed from staff to students.

then began the dispersal of people to their respective workshops. we were redirected as per what was listed on the program. i made my way to the s building with others i talked to on the frigid, leisurely stroll there. we were all interested in the social media workshop. we reached room 204 and it was only four of us, including myself. more people flowed into the narrow hallway, but the situation soon turned into outrage and disapproval by 11am. it was a some 15-20 of us and the only non-student we were greeted with was the janitor. he was unable to assist us on information to remedy the situation. 

then we were met with the vp of <college name>s' student government. she was unable to help us, other then by letting us into her office to hangout. we were then told that we were not misnomers and not the only ones with trouble attending a workshop. for what i ascertained, the only workshop properly running at that time was the public speaking one. <workshop name> had to be rescheduled because the guest speaker was not relayed the proper information to be in the right room when his time was scheduled.

then here we are, a band of outsiders. both the x and y workshops were placed in rooms next to each other. it was not just those interested in one workshop but two. we were cut from the loop with no means to communicate to the others whom were having actual workshops. we had waited far too long and were far too cozy to trek into the frozen tundra to reach someone for help. as rational beings, it was the right thing to do. if the building's janitor and a person whom was invited onto the stage to speak during the welcoming remarks could not help us; then who could? the right thing to have done would have been to send one of the nicely dressed ushers (that was there to direct us to the locations of the rooms to the actual workshops being conducted at that time) to the rooms listed on the program and redirect any wayward souls to the right path. 

however, that was not done. to reiterate, we were briefed to check the programs emailed to us for where the workshop we were interested in was. then since the wifi was not working, most of us could not view the program. thus, we had to rely on those nearest to us to quickly glance at their phone with the program for the room number. i am giving the benefit of the doubt. there was no doubt; it was hectic and mr. zack may have said that the rooms were changed, but even so, we could not have reasonably foreseen this. keep in my mind, most of us in attendance are not <college name> students. for many students including myself, it was our first time even stepping foot on the campus. we could not navigate through unfamiliar territory all on our own. we all have reasonable expectations and my group expected a staff member to come to the rooms to tell us we were in the wrong place. 

from that point on, like the emerging leaders we are, we all decided to conduct our own workshop. i am here to tell the story of what happened in s204 on friday february 21, 2015. i am the odysseus to achilles and the myrmidons, the aristodemus to leonidas and the spartan armies that saw what they wanted and took it. we seized this opportunity to see what we were made of. through the adversity, we built character, mental fortitude, and positivity. in light of our situation, we held our workshop on communication. we assessed everything right up until that point and everything wrong. it started with a fundamental of human interaction.

roles were delegated amongst us and it our workshop could not succeed without a leader. that leader was jenny, professional penis toucher. when i write and speak of an incredible person, she was it. her personal story was anything but bland, but it was awe-inspiring. she took the reins and liberties of leading us on why the communication at <event name> failed. the mode of communication was mute. it was not conveyed and run as concisely as it should have been. to be a great leader, you need to have empathy. please understand where i am venting my frustrations from. to be a great leader, there needs to be accountability. we were put into an environment where we all should have been looked after. to be a great leader, your decisions have to have decisiveness and conviction. your yes's must mean yes and your no's must mean no. we did not take well to being flip flopped around at an event to have the program say we needed to be here when in actuality, we needed to be there. that is what i learned at the fifth, hidden workshop on communication at <event name>.

in a bit of apropo, i was able to log on to the wifi. whilst the keynote speaker was speaking, i selected another network out of sheer curiosity. it was the closed network x. i entered the exact login credentials from the beginning of the day and it worked! it was another example of disconnected communication. whilst checking my email, i received an email from <event name> on how the afternoon workshops were rescheduled. i will say that email was definitely not the way to go about this. to simply rely on "sharing with any friends who do not have a smartphone" will leave some people lost and fallen through the cracks. even in the beginning stages beforehand, all the information that needed to be said should have been said in an email well before the conference was to begin. when i first arrived at <college name>, i had to ask the security guard where the conference was because i could not readily see or gather from the emails sent where the breakfast was being held. i was not alone in that either. the timing of your emails was extremely misplaced. i received the program email at 8:00pm which gave a small 12 hour window for me to even know what i was getting from registering to the conference. sure, i like surprises, but that was too small of a time frame. lastly, arrows, papers logically placed throughout the buildings, telephone poles, etc. to guide students would have been much appreciated.

that is all i have to say for my problems with <event name> 2015. i do realize i am whimsical writer and it was my way of venting my frustrations across. during the fifth workshop, it was suggested that a future <name of event> committee be comprised mostly, if possible solely of student leaders and ambassadors. really, any <college name> student that would be dedicated and enthusiastic to provide a great atmosphere for their fellow <college name> members. i hope this all gets read and put into consideration. i understand event planning is stressful, but it was a huge success. disregarding all that, i would still recommend any invitee to attend any future conference as it was still a worthwhile experience for me. lastly, i do apologize for my campusinism after the winner of the tablet was announced. i am sure, i scared some people screaming <college name>.

sincerely,
contact information"



few things to keep in mind, my response was done on a google form, but i chose not to be anonymous by putting my contact information. i tried to be passive, but as the writing progressed, i could not stop. so i was given a outs a couple of times...

critique me if you can. my grammar is not perfect and i am sure i misused some of the terms. also, i realized my responses is overcentralizing my complaining on the wifi when it was not my primary concern.

    Here is the summary: You attended a conference at your college and had a negative experience due to various issues, including poor communication, incorrect information, and technical difficulties with the wifi network

in a bit of apropo, i was able to log on to the wifi. whilst the keynote speaker was speaking, i selected another network out of sheer curiosity. it was the closed network x. i entered the exact login credentials from the beginning of the day and it worked! it was another example of disconnected communication. whilst checking my email, i received an email from <event name> on how the afternoon workshops were rescheduled. i will say that email was definitely not the way to go about this. to simply rely on "sharing with any friends who do not have a smartphone" will leave some people lost and fallen through the cracks. even in the beginning stages beforehand, all the information that needed to be said should have been said in an email well before the conference was to begin. when i first arrived at <college name>, i had to ask the security guard where the conference was because i could not readily see or gather from the emails sent where the breakfast was being held. i was not alone in that either. the timing of your emails was extremely misplaced. i received the program email at 8:00pm which gave a small 12 hour window for me to even know what i was getting from registering to the conference. sure, i like surprises, but that was too small of a time frame. lastly, arrows, papers logically placed throughout the buildings, telephone poles, etc. to guide students would have been much appreciated.

that is all i have to say for my problems with <event name> 2015. i do realize i am whimsical writer and it was my way of venting my frustrations across. during the fifth workshop, it was suggested that a future <name of event> committee be comprised mostly, if possible solely of student leaders and ambassadors. really, any <college name> student that would be dedicated and enthusiastic to provide a great atmosphere for their fellow <college name> members. i hope this all gets read and put into consideration. i understand event planning is stressful, but it was a huge success. disregarding all that, i would still recommend any invitee to attend any future conference as it was still a worthwhile experience for me. lastly, i do apologize for my campusinism after the winner of the tablet was announced. i am sure, i scared some people screaming <college name>.

sincerely,
contact information"



few things to keep in mind, my response was done on a google form, but i chose not to be anonymous by putting my contact information. i tried to be passive, but as the writing progressed, i could not stop. so i was given a outs a couple of times...

critique me if you can. my grammar is not perfect and i am sure i misused some of the terms. also, i realized my responses is overcentralizing my complaining on the wifi when it was not my primary concern.

    Here is the summary: You attended a conference at your college and had a negative experience due to various issues, including poor communication, misleading information, and technical difficulties with the wifi network

    Here is the article: so this fuckup actually happened yesterday, when i was reminded that in order to rush a fraternity at my school i had to sign up to attend anti-hazing seminars. i searched through my emails for the link to rsvp, and clicked the first one i found. "awesome," i thought, "i can still sign up!" it asked me for my name, my email, my gpa, and for a picture.

i uploaded a bomb ass picture. suave. smooth. black and white.

submitted the form, and then bothered to look at the page header. panhellenic council... hm. that sounds familiar.  hellenic, greek, yeah, greek life! cue my friend peering over at my computer and proceeding to burst out in laughter. and now i get it: panhellenic council. the group that oversees all sororities on campus. me: "shit." my friend: shitting himself with laughter.

i have since received emails telling me about the lifelong friends i'm going to make though my sorority, so i'm pretty hyped to say the least. i think i'm just gonna let this one run its course and see where it goes.

    Here is the article: i transferred to a new department within my line of work recently and slowly got to know the lady that sits next to me in our training classes.  i thought she was beautiful when i met her, but had this "out of my league" mentality about it.  two weeks later, a bunch of us were drinking and i managed to muster up the courage and ask her out on a date.  she said yes and i exploded with joy on the inside.  


turn to last night, date night.  i had originally planned to go to dinner and then drinks at a comedy club, but the tickets were sold out.  being that it was a new town, i used trip advisor to find something to do in town.  i settled on a dinner and theatre location and bought us tickets for the musicla they had going.  she's a black woman, the first time i've ever been with one, and on the drive down to the city, a commercial for a tv show called underground came on.  she briefly talked about how she hates things that market on slavery and such.  we get to the dinner theatre, and i hadn't actually looked into what the musical was about.  felt a little out of place at first, as there was a whole lot of elderly white people at the venue, while we're in our mid-late twenties.  dinner was great, and then the show started.  2 hours of singing, and dancing about the underground railroad.


car ride was a bit awkward going back to our rooms, and i haven't spoken to her yet.

    Here is the article: i've debated for a really long time on whether i should post this or not, but every time i tell the story everyone gets a kick out of it. so whatever, here we go.

three months ago, i fucked up. my coworkers and i went to go see a concert at a giant outdoor pavilion. i live in houston and hate the awful traffic, and i hate this pavilion, so i was trying not to be so grouchy before the show... but i was not a happy camper by the time we got there. we finally parked and walked 50000 miles to the gates and i decided that i would rather buy shitty overpriced food than hear courtney love scream into the microphone on stage (we arrived as late as possible so that we wouldn't have to sit through her set). i bought pretzel chips and hummus and bottled water for a measly $10.50. we were trying to decide where to sit and i could barely hear anyone over love's slurring, and as we’re looking around i see nothing but beautiful people at this place. suddenly i felt super self-conscious of all these super pretty girls around me because i look so plain. so many flower crowns and crop tops. i'm no lesbian, but oh my god. i was severely under-dressed for this show and i was in such a bad mood already- i couldn’t wait to just sit and wait and then go home forever….

we settle in on the grass and sit. and wait. i eat my hummus and chips. and sit. i'm already sweating my tits off, i drank all my water and water is $4, so forget buying another one. i'm sweating and bored out of my mind, so i'm people-watching. since i'm feeling like i don't belong, i get this awesome idea to light a cigarette. smoking is easy and makes anyone look 150% cooler. i'm gonna smoke a cigarette. lana del rey smokes, and i'm here to see her sing tonight, so why not light up? it’s perfect. nothing can go wrong.

i ask one of my coworkers for a cig. she only raises an eyebrow at me.

"uhh, you don't smoke. these are my expensive american spirits, you're just going to waste it."

"i just want to smoke one. i can definitely smoke the whole thing."

"no, we'll just share."

the fuck? it's my god given right as an adult to smoke a whole cigarette by myself! i beg and plead and she finally gives me one. after struggling to light it for about 30 seconds (it was slightly windy outside, ok), i get half of it burning. then i even it out. now we're cooking. i feel better. i'm taking small drags, trying not to cough. and she looks over at me to see how her budding addict is doing. she is such an enabler.

"you're not inhaling.” she says. “try it like this." and she walks me through it.

i end up taking drag after drag with her coaching me on how to get more bang for my buck and suddenly i've smoked three quarters of a cigarette in less than two minutes. 

i know the effects of nicotine in the long run. obviously, addiction. the head rushes. nerves being calmed. i knew nothing of the short term effects, such as sudden nausea.

i feel my stomach betraying me and my throat getting ready to expel demons from my solar plexus. "i don't... feel so good." 

she sees the fear/panic in my eyes and shifts away from me. it's a good thing, too, because i pretty much ralph all over my hands as i cupped them under my mouth. i try my best to catch the vomit because i don’t want to throw up on my backpack that was in my lap. i lean over to wipe my hands off in the grass and clean them as much as i could. no one else has water or wants to waste their beer on my vomittens so i'm just coughing and shamefully wiping sick off in the grass in front of me.

this girl probably 3 or 4 feet in front of me must have heard me rejecting the chips and hummus and turns around to stare at me, screaming, "that's fucking disgusting! how could you?"

yeah, no shit; it’s not like i'm having a party over here.

still in shock, i have no words for her, so she continues her tirade. "you just puked on me."

what? no. there's no way. there can't be. i caught it all. it’s in the grass.

with as much dignity as i could muster, i sort of choke out, "i'm pretty sure i didn't." and with that, she pulls her shirt away from her body and furiously points to three *huge* globs staining the back and side of her *white* shirt. it suspiciously looks like- *oh god*

she really did have nasty hummus/pretzel puke on her, somehow, and i have done nothing to help my case so far. so now that she has my attention, she dismisses me with a wave of the hand. "just go get me some fucking napkins. and water, so i can clean myself off."

in my post-puking haze, i somehow stumble up the grassy incline to the concession stand in the back and awkwardly ask the police officer there (the lines were long, and i wasn't going to interrupt someone) for a bundle of napkins, trying not to look drunk as fuck. feeling a bit better after moving around, i just awkwardly shamble back to my group and hand my accidental victim the whole stack of napkins i acquired, not taking any for myself. i'm just a wreck at this point, not feeling good, totally hoping no one around me is still watching. she and her friend immediately get up and move, thank god, now i won't have to stare at her back and my marksmanship.

a girl i barely just met that night leaned towards me and said, "that is the best thing i've seen all night and you handled it really well." everyone in my group agreed, and they reassured me when i tried to defend the girl i puked on. i did feel really bad, though. i probably ruined her night. i know mine was ruined. i laid down during the whole concert, so people probably thought i was drunk.

    Here is the summary: The author recounts a story of how they embarrassingly vomited on someone during a concert after smoking a cigarette for the first time, despite not being a smoker

    Here is the article: so as a college student, i hold a work-study job as a custodial assistant, and most of what i do is vacuuming rooms. there was a break room that needed to be vacuumed, so i went up the elevator, walked into the room (the light was already on), and plugged in the vacuum cleaner. i turned it on and started in one direction that covered most of the floor. when i went back for what was left, i somehow failed to notice the cords for the window blinds and sucked them in, creating a screech and pulling up one side of the blinds.

i flipped the switch back off and laid it on the side to try to pull the cords back out. i initially made some progress and got the blinds themselves to where they were, but i couldn't get past a point and called the person in charge of day-to-day tasks in that building, who in turn called someone who actually knew how to take the vacuum cleaner apart.

fortunately, that vacuum cleaner was brought from the first floor, and there was another on the third; furthermore, all i got so far for that fuckup was a warning from my boss to stop thinking of my nonexistent girlfriend while vacuuming.

    Here is the article: this is not as interesting as you think.

so i've been playing fallout: new vegas for a while now, and i've got a little less than half way through the game. i've been using cass as a companion (though that may change after this), and i 'd just finished her mission to (**spoilers**) get revenge on the crimson caravan and silver rush. if you've played the game (and why are you reading this if you haven't played the game), then you know that there are a fucking shit ton of energy weapons in silver rush. i stole them all after i killed the shop keeper and made cass carry them. i planned on taking a few from her to sell as i needed caps, but the laws of the bethesda glitches had something else in mind. 

about half an hour ago i saved my game and then fast traveled to the mojave outpost to repair my weapons (this autosaves). before that i'd visitors gomorrah, which is an in game casino. in new vegas you can't take weapons into the casinos. so when the npc asked me to turn over my weapons, i allowed him to take them. what i didn't know is that this applies to my companion! they took all my expensive energy weapons from cass. usually they give them back after visiting, but bethesda games are glitchy as shit. they were never returned to her, and i've both saved and autosaved since the incident. those weapons we stolen, there's no way to get them back, and i can't load up an older save to get them. overall they were worth about 15k caps (fallout currency).

    Here is the article: as i am currently about to sleep out the couch because of a very upset wife, i realized i messed up. 

while rough housing with my 3yr old son today we invented a new game... and well it didnt go over well with mommy.

as it typical is with roughhousing with a toddler, accidents happen and bumps are made. while playing my son tripped on his own feet and bumped his head pretty good and started to cry. after he was done crying he wiped his nose and left a giant booger behind. as any parent can tell you, after a while you get desensitized to all of the gross things so i just grabbed it quick and was going to dispose of it.

well after he looked at me and with the most sincere face possible told me how gross it looked an idea popped into my head, so without missing a beat i wiped it right back onto is face, and many giggles were had. this lead to a 30 minute booger fight with him jamming his finger deep into his nose to get more boogers. after all the fun and grossness was had and we finished our game i cleaned him up and thought i was done with it.

jump to mommy getting home from work. about 2 hours after she got home my son thought it would be great fun to play the game with mommy so without missing a beat he walks right up to her, finger deep in his own personal gold mine, pulls his finger out and smacks her in the cheek and proudly exclaimed boogey smack! needless to say the look on my wifes face was priceless. that was till i explained why he had done that.

she when from full on bewilderment to anger in a flash. she proceeded to inform me in a very angry and loud manner that as a father and adult at 25 that i should know better and have better sense than to teach my son a game like that, and in no way was it as funny as i thought.

    Here is the article: he signed up to work for uber, that car company where you use a phone app to book transportation jobs.  he wanted to make some money on the side.

he went to an open house today, signed up, gave them his information.  they asked if he wanted a copy of his background check emailed to him.  he gave them my email address.

i opened the link just a few minutes ago.  he is a registered sex offender in the state of new york.  

we've been together 11 years.  it never came up.

i'm open minded, but jeez.  i see him in a different red light.

 




update: he came home, was all excited about uber, and started telling me the experience he had.  i asked him if he knew they did a background check, and he told me he didn't.  he asked them to forward all correspondence to me, as he isn't much of a reading type.

so i told him uber ran a background check.  no immediate jerk reactions.  i told him he had some moving violations, and he was upset that they were able to dig that up.  then i told him that he was listed as a registered sex offender.  

he played dumb.  "who, me?"  ugh.  i kept pressing.  then he confessed that he tried picking up a prostitute, who ended up being an undercover officer with a doggie.  he even told her, "you don't look like you belong in the streets."  long story short, he said yes to sex, and got arrested.

i was shocked, because he didn't seem the type to need to pay for sex.  he said i was making it a big deal, because he didn't get to have sex with her.  uh?  

he assures me he didn't pay for sex after me.  he said that's the reason he decided to settle down, so he wouldn't have to pay for it.  explains why i never get gifts or presents, no matter the event.

so, it's something that happened before me, it wasn't pedophilia or rape.  it wasn't public urination.  i'll drop it, like pants in an alley.

he assures me he didn't pay for sex after me.  he said that's the reason he decided to settle down, so he wouldn't have to pay for it.  explains why i never get gifts or presents, no matter the event.

so, it's something that happened before me, it wasn't pedophilia or rape.  it wasn't public urination.  i'll drop it, like pants in an alley.

    Here is the summary: The author's partner, who is a registered sex offender in New York, signed up to work for Uber despite not disclosing his criminal history
    


    You will be given one summary written for a news article. Your task is to rate the summary based on the following criteria:
    Output format: PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE

    Evaluation Criteria:
    1. Read the news article carefully and identify the main topic and key points.
    2. Read the summary and compare it to the news article. Check if the summary covers the main topic and key points of the news article, and if it resents them in a clear and logical order.
    3. Rate the summary with 5 percentages, where each one represents how likely the summary is going to get a score from 1 to 5. For example, if you think the summary is 80% likely to get a score of 5, 10% likely to get a score of 4, 5% likely to get a score of 3, 3% likely to get a score of 2, and 1% likely to get a score of 1, you should rate the summary as 80, 10, 5, 3, 2.

    Here is the article: i had finally run out of garbage bags and decided that today would be a good day to replenish my stock, as various bits of garbage had begun to accumulate in a pile on my kitchen counter. since most of my sunday afternoons are spent inside (wallowing in the entrails of one of the eight meals i eat throughout the day) i wore my shorts commando to the grocery store to ensure minimal effort spent preparing for the errand. 

i headed to my neighborhood meijer store and made for the garbage bag section. my gait was somewhat impeded by the large amount of gas that had accumulated in my lower gut, no doubt the end result of the inhuman amount of food i had recently consumed.

i got to the waste disposal section, which forms the outer border of a dense block of aisles; in other words, it butts up against a wider aisle that serves as a main thoroughfare for shoppers. the aisles were packed with people cramming in one last bit of shopping before the work week. 

i quickly scanned the aisle until i found a particularly sturdy, robust-looking roll of heavy-duty garbage bags. it was encased in a plastic sheath that looked rubbery and grippy.

i picked up the roll with one hand. within a split second of realizing that it was roughly the weight and density of a small kettlebell and the shape of a battering ram, i also realized that the sheath that held it was not grippy, but slippery, as if it had been dipped in oil. i was now engaged in a juggling act, since i had a full basket of groceries in the other hand. i considered dropping the basket, but instead held onto it to use it as a makeshift balancing rod due to the sheer weight of the garbage-bag-roll in my other hand. 

as the roll bounced around in my hand the plastic crinkled loudly, attracting the attention of all nearby shoppers. i felt the roll slipping off the back of my hand and quickly jerked my hand toward my body to steady it. i got my hand underneath the roll, but not in time to prevent it from slamming into my nuts and lower abdomen (mind you, this was a wide roll of garbage bags), causing me to void all the gas brewing inside me into a pair of mesh shorts that had no underwear to diffuse the raw, concentrated stench of fart.

shoppers reacted in a rich variety of ways. some covered their nose and mouth with their hand, the way people do in movies when particularly shocked or repulsed by something. some broke into outright laughter then and there. but most of them graciously went about their business as if nothing had happened. what i'd give to know what was going through their minds.

    Here is the summary: The author had a comically embarrassing experience at the grocery store when they tried to purchase garbage bags but struggled to hold onto the heavy roll, causing it to bounce off their hand and hit their groin, releasing a loud and pungent fart

    Here is the article: so, this started out yesterday evening and has been an ongoing saga. i'll start off by stating that i suffer from mild psoriasis. it was much worse when i was a kid but as i've gotten older my outbreaks have contained themselves to small patches on my elbows, knucles, and knees. well, recently a patch has started to crop up on my face around the bridge of my nose and nostrils. as a single male with a new prospective lady friend this has frustrated me to no end. in the past, i have read that exposure to uvb rays helps to alleviate outbreaks and reduce redness and scaling. so i figured what the hell, why don't i try and get some sun? so i take myself out into the wilderness, strip butt ass naked and lay down to try and catch some sun. it was kinda pleasant out during all of this, so i figured i'd catch a nap. what's the worst thing that could happen? fast forward 4 hours later, i wake up face down on the ground, my whole body cold and shivering as the the sun has gone down and there is a distinctly uncomfortable tingling sensation all over my face and back. i gather my thngs and take myself home. upon arrival, i notice that the goosebumps on my skin wont go away and i'm turning a darker shade of red than i am used to. at this point, i paid it no mind and went about my business cooking a small dinner and getting ready for bed. by the time i'm finished, i can hardly sit down without wincing. everything is painful. i take a look in the mirror at my naked backside and behold that it is become death, the destroyer of butts. it looked the equivalent of an apple bottom, true to color even. sleep was impossible. i spent a good 45 minutes soaking in a cool vinegar bath and basically hating myself for even thinking this was a good idea. i spent the rest of the night putting cold washclothes on my butt cheeks, back, chest, and face. come the morning, while i was getting ready for work, i noticed that my nose was awfully congested and i a slight soreness in the back of my throat. so now, not only is my  ass redder than i.r. baboon, i have a head cold and sore throat to keep me company in my misery.

    Here is the article: so, we were doing our nighttime routine, getting ready for bed, brushing teeth and hair, saying prayers, reading books, etc. my 3 yr old daughter kept saying she wanted to sleep in mommy and daddy's bed. i explained to her that it's really difficult for us to get a good night sleep because she's a little skouliki (which is greek for little worm) and squiggles around the entire bed at night.

she asked what that meant so i told her it meant she was a squiggly little worm and couldn't sleep still at night, like a little bug. she immediately got a terrified look on her face and said, "no! bugs are outside!" i said, "yes, bugs belong outside. our bed is like a home, and your bed is like outside, and since you're a little skouliki, you should be 'outside' like a bug."

now she's hysterical that there are bugs in her bed, won't go near it, and is now lying on my side of my bed. to top it all off, i apologized for scaring her and told her that i'm sure i'm making her a monster by letting her sleep in our bed tonight, but she's always a monster anyway, so i guess nothing really changes. now she's terrified that there are monsters in the house, too...guess who's not getting a good night's sleep tonight?!

so i go surf for two hours and have some of the most fun waves i've had in a long time. on my way back as stoked as can be my friend who i was with asks me, "gdshred95, where is your car?" i responded "shut up what are you talking about," do a double take, and see that my car is in fact gone. we call the police and go through the whole process of trying to trace our phones but unfortunately this guy was smarter than we thought and shut both of them off. after all this we are told that our case is of low priority but that they will be on the lookout. that sounded promising. long story short all my valuables such as wallet and phone were in there and now i am waiting and hoping my car has not been taken to a chop shop, is still intact, and is found. 

it is ironic how such a great day can end in a shitty way.

    Here is the article: so some background first. my family is a uber health conscious crazy about healthy food and i agree with that for the most part. but i can't just eat healthy food every day without a single bit of sugar. so i go to a fast food place once a month to get my fix. i usually eat it at home in the comfort of my computer playing games till my parents get home, but if they found out they would probably beat me for this. so i got a bright idea to burn the paper bag and wrapper that it comes in and carefully collect those ashes and throw it outside.

i do this once a month and throw the ashes over some little flowers in my backyard. i do this steadily for a few months and nothing goes wrong. well one day at school we have to take home this fish once a week or so to collect data on its habits. well i take a fish home every week and then i always take it back to school the next day at 5 in the morning. well my neighbors see me come home sometimes because they're this amazing old couple who just sits and watches the outdoors together and they probably see me come home with a fish every week or so.

so every week i take home a fish but since i leave so early they never see the fish leave my house. then they see me in the afternoons after i come home go outside and spread some ashes over some flowers because in my mind i think ashes are good for plants so i do that, but this old couple thought i was cremating my dead fish and tossing their ashes once a month.

being the amazingly nice people they are, after last weeks burning of evidence, they stop by and they're carrying a little fish tank with this beta fish in it and when i open the door they say they saw me spreading the ashes of my fish and hoped this fish would outlive the rest and then they said goodbye and left me there kinda shocked at what just happened. it was then that i realized that they thought my fish were tragically dying every month and that i kept replacing them in hopes of outliving the rest.

    Here is the article: so we've been putting down new flooring for the last couple weekends in our house. i reached a point where a outlet needed to be moved. this is a bit of a hassle because we have a older house with a root cellar. in the summer you can walk around the back of the house and go in the door. in the winter you have to open a hatch in our foyer and climb down onto a ladder we keep down there. so i climb down and shut off the break, and climb back up. 

i go to work on the outlet and need my pliers so i ask my fiancee to grab them for me. i hear the door open when suddenly there is a loud crash. at first i assumed she dropped something and just yell "what was that". suddenly it hits me, i left the hatch to the basement open. i run to the front door and sure enough she is in the basement, somehow already standing after the 6' drop onto a pile of old floor boards, but very shaken/panicked.  she managed to climb to the top and i lifted her out of the basement.

 
i left the hatch to our root cellar open. my fiancee took the express elevator to the basement.

    Here is the article: so we've been putting down new flooring for the last couple weekends in our house. i reached a point where a outlet needed to be moved. this is a bit of a hassle because we have a older house with a root cellar. in the summer you can walk around the back of the house and go in the door. in the winter you have to open a hatch in our foyer and climb down onto a ladder we keep down there. so i climb down and shut off the break, and climb back up.

    Here is the article: this has literally just happened and i'm wincing a little..

a bit of background: so i work part-time in a video game store in a shopping centre.
i only work a few hours a day but the hours i work are important for other people.
also i don't drive so i have to rely on "peasant wagons" or buses that are irregular as everyone knows.

now, here's my fu.
i left my house quite casually, thinking i have plenty of time to get the bus to work today. (i start at half 2 gmt).
only to turn the corner and see my bus pelting off in the distance like a fat kid chasing cake.
fuck up number one. i didn't leave early enough.

i think, it's ok, i'll just call work, i'll only be a bit late, they'll understand.
"yeah mattydev, that's cool. see you soon"
sweet i'm getting away with this.
so +1 for getting away with being late.
the next bus is only another 10 minutes that's plenty of time i think to myself, plenty of time for what exactly i hear you ask? to browse reddit, more specifically tifu!

i sit down on the nearest bench, pull out my phone, pop in my headphones, put some george ezra on and giggle my way through tifu while waiting for the bus.

some time later: i look up to see what time my bus is going to be, and there it is. pulling around the corner. at this moment in time it might as well be flipping me off.

so yeah. tifu.

    Here is the summary: You left your house late for work and missed your bus, causing you to be late for your shift at the video game store

    Here is the article: just happened a few hours ago. 

context: i was supposed to bring some equipment to a smash bros weekly in my town, and i was running late. the power was off when i woke up, meaning that my alarm didn't go off.

i get dressed, eat, grab my bag and equipment and head out of my apartment building to get my bike. i notice the sound of thunder in the distance, but there was no rain at all. it was only a fifteen minute bike ride away, i should be able to get there no problem.

fast forward to two minutes later, and the downpour had started. i wear glasses normally, but the rain was so thick and heavy that i had to take them off just to be able to see. it was uncomfortable, but not anything i hadn't biked through before. i cursed my lack of foresight.

five minutes in, i get to the highway intersection. the highway cuts through the middle of my town, and sometimes it can be a pain in the ass to cross. as i approached the intersection, it had started to hail. and not just any hail, but chunks of ice 1-3cm or more in diameter. 

at this point, i was panicking. i needed to get into cover, but as i was right at the intersection to the highway and it was open in all directions for a hundred meters at least. the light changes, and i hop on my bike and activate the electric motor (it's a normal bike modified with a battery and electric motor, i use it when i don't feel like pedaling) so that i can use my feet to control my speed, as my brake pads were almost useless at this point. instead of walking my bike like a sane human being.

i manage to cross the intersection, and go over the curb onto the sidewalk. from there, there's a shitty dirt path that cuts through a ditch and some bushes, and i go down it a little too fast. i take the curve a bit too harshly, and suddenly i'm head over ass into the bush, eating shit in the swampy ass ditch with trash, water, and mud rushing all around me, about a foot deep. my bike landed upside down.

i could feel a sharp pain in my left wrist and right ankle, and i knew almost immediately that i'd sprained them both. didn't hurt bad enough to be a break. i didn't have any time to lay in the quickly flooding ditch, pelted by hailstones and sharp, pouring rain. i struggle back to my feet out of the foot deep water ignoring the pain, lifting my heavy ass electric bike back up onto its wheels, and run it to the nearest building, where i take cover behind it.

finally safe from the hail and only a little bit of water coming down as the blowing wind was being blocked by the building, i was able to inspect myself as my bike. left wrist sprained, right ankle sprained, very sore body. right foot hurts way worse than the wrist. bike, surprisingly, held up perfectly. i disconnected the battery and waited out the storm behind the building until the storm let up.

next time, i'll respect the weather a little more. i thought i was going to break some bones when i took the dive. i can't imagine what would have happened if i couldn't get out of that flooded ditch.

    Here is the summary: You were running late to a Smash Bros weekly and didn't notice the storm brewing until you were already on your bike, leading to a hazardous ride with hail and flooding that left you with sprained wrist and ankle

i wish this happened over a decade ago, but this fu happened in the past week. let's begin.

i've always thought that turning 21 was just going to be another year. i mean, i've always been able to get the alcohol i wanted by asking my so or best friend. why would being legal change anything? well it does. it changes you. it evolves you into this bigger, better, more legal person. you become invincible. no one can tell you that "they are too busy to go to the store" or that "they don't feel like it." hell, i'll just hop in my car, pop out my id and bam, i have the ability to get lit that night. the night after my birthday i was feeling extra amazing and thought "i'll just buy one six pack and be done". i get to the store, get two six packs, a bottle of wine, and some food to get fat on. keep in mind that this is after my birthday so i have left over vodka and rum from the night of destruction. couple hours later, i'm passed out in bed. practically dead. the next night my so comes over and he brings his own beer saying that we are getting legally wasted. i'm all for it. like hell yeah, i'm a new person. i'm legal. i drink and pass out again. this time i'm not too sure how i got into bed. pretty sure so helped out a bit. so both nights in a row i've had way too much alcohol and no water. zip. honestly don't know how i survived or didn't get a hangover. i get dressed for work, take a piss, go to work, and take another piss. half an hour goes by and i'm going piss again... oh no...i have a uti. that's the first fu. because of all the sugar, i gave myself a fucking uti. damn it. 7 hours left on my shift and my body basically hates me and wants me to pee on myself. finally get home, take some azo, and i'm good the next day. what do i do? celebrate. i'm cured. why not? i'll just pop another pill if my body decides to hate me again. lol. next fu. so again, too much alcohol, no water, basically a alcoholic mermaid by now. dehydrated af. i wake up and i notice a certain ache in my lower back. like its not too bad. i get up, go to the grocery for the essentials, go back home, and my back feels like it's throbbing. can't walk. i'm dying. i don't know what to do, i'm thinking that this shit just comes with age, and i go to bed. i wake up feeling kind of amazing. lower back doesn't feel like satan anymore. i call my mom and tell her the situation and she's like "omg child, that's called a muscle spasm. i'm going to buy you all the stuff you need, don't move." so i don't. she gets me tylenol and icy hot. i take both around 5 and i'm good. go to bed feeling great. wake up at 2am feeling not so great. i put icy hot on my back because i really didn't feel like eating and then taking some pills. too much effort and i could barely walk let alone breathe this pain was so bad. an hour in and icy hot is sucking leggit dick. i'm thinking "i'll take a shower and relax the muscles." probably the biggest fu yet. i finally, get in the bathroom and get the water running, swallow some tylenol, and hesitate to get in the shower. i know the stories of icy hot and water. i know it's like 1000 suns touching your back, but i honestly thought an hour was enough time for the shit to be done with. just in case, i put my hand in the water and touch my back to see if there was any pain.... didn't feel anything. great! i sit down, let the shower run, 10 minutes later the tylenol kicks in. i can breathe, i can walk, i can suddenly feel my back burning like google said it would. i get out of the shower and quickly put a towel on my back but it's  no use, the burn is too great. i sit on the toilet while the shower water runs and try to accept my back cooking to a crisp. i guess it being around 430-500 am, my body was too exhausted and i fell asleep. on the toilet. while the shower was running. so at 9:30, when i finally woke up, i turn the shower off and start planning on how the hell i'm going to pay for this water bill. the last and final fu.

don't turn 21. it's a trap. 

 

update: i did have a kidney infection! went to the doctor because you guys had scared me so bad. reddit saved me. you guys are awesome.

    Here is the summary: The author turned 21 and experienced a series of unfortunate events, including getting a UTI, muscle spasms, and a burn from using icy hot and water

i've always thought that turning 21 was just going to be another year. i mean, i've always been able to get the alcohol i wanted by asking my so or best friend. why would being legal change anything? well it does. it changes you. it evolves you into this bigger, better, more legal person. you become invincible. no one can tell you that "they are too busy to go to the store" or that "they don't feel like it." hell, i'll just hop in my car, pop out my id and bam, i have the ability to get lit that night. the night after my birthday i was feeling extra amazing and thought "i'll just buy one six pack and be done". i get to the store, get two six packs, a bottle of wine, and some food to get fat on. keep in mind that this is after my birthday so i have left over vodka and rum from the night of destruction. couple hours later, i'm passed out in bed. practically dead. the next night my so comes over and he brings his own beer saying that we are getting legally wasted. i'm all for it. like hell yeah, i'm a new person. i'm legal. i drink and pass out again. this time i'm not too sure how i got into bed. pretty sure so helped out a bit. so both nights in a row i've had way too much alcohol and no water. zip. honestly don't know how i survived or didn't get a hangover. i get dressed for work, take a piss, go to work, and take another piss. half an hour goes by and i'm going piss again... oh no...i have a uti. that's the first fu. because of all the sugar, i gave myself a fucking uti. damn it. 7 hours left on my shift and my body basically hates me and wants me to pee on myself. finally get home, take some azo, and i'm good the next day. what do i do? celebrate. i'm cured. why not? i'll just pop another pill if my body decides to hate me again. lol. next fu. so again, too much alcohol, no water, basically a alcoholic mermaid by now. dehydrated af. i wake up and i notice a certain ache in my lower back. like its not too bad. i get up, go to the grocery for the essentials, go back home, and my back feels like it's throbbing. can't walk. i'm dying. i don't know what to do, i'm thinking that this shit just comes with age, and i go to bed. i wake up feeling kind of amazing. lower back doesn't feel like satan anymore. i call my mom and tell her the situation and she's like "omg child, that's called a muscle spasm. i'm going to buy you all the stuff you need, don't move." so i don't. she gets me tylenol and icy hot. i take both around 5 and i'm good. go to bed feeling great. wake up at 2am feeling not so great. i put icy hot on my back because i really didn't feel like eating and then taking some pills. too much effort and i could barely walk let alone breathe this pain was so bad. an hour in and icy hot is sucking leggit dick. i'm thinking "i'll take a shower and relax the muscles." probably the biggest fu yet. i finally, get in the bathroom and get the water running, swallow some tylenol, and hesitate to get in the shower. i know the stories of icy hot and water. i know it's like 1000 suns touching your back, but i honestly thought an hour was enough time for the shit to be done with. just in case, i put my hand in the water and touch my back to see if there was any pain.... didn't feel anything. great! i sit down, let the shower run, 10 minutes later the tylenol kicks in. i can breathe, i can walk, i can suddenly feel my back burning like google said it would. i get out of the shower and quickly put a towel on my back but it's  no use, the burn is too great. i sit on the toilet while the shower water runs and try to accept my back cooking to a crisp. i guess it being around 430-500 am, my body was too exhausted and i fell asleep. on the toilet. while the shower was running. so at 9:30, when i finally woke up, i turn the shower off and start planning on how the hell i'm going to pay for this water bill. the last and final fu.

don't turn 21. it's a trap. 

 

update: i did have a kidney infection! went to the doctor because you guys had scared me so bad. reddit saved me. you guys are awesome.

    Here is the summary: The author turned 21 and celebrated by drinking excessively, leading to several health issues, including a UTI, muscle spasms, and a possible kidney infection

    Here is the article: for once on this subreddit, this fuck up happened today.
--------------------------
i was sitting at home, hungry, and decided it would be a good idea to make a sandwich. no big deal, right? well i didn't want to wait for the oven to heat up and i didn't want to eat it cold, so i tried something i'd seen in a reddit post a few months ago. i flipped my toaster onto its side and put in each half of the sandwich. after a few seconds, i started smelling something burning. turning around, i see smoke bellowing from the toaster. i have never cleaned my toaster, nor has anyone else that i know of, so it was full of long forgotten crumbs that i hadn't thought of that was now burning in my toaster.

here's where the fuck up really begins -

my toaster doesn't have a cancel button, so i immediately unplugged it and attempted to fish the sandwich halves out with my bare hands, because obviously i wasn't going to be dumb enough to stick a fork in it. i was very careful not to touch the sides, however apparently i wasn't careful enough. my hand grazed the hot part of the toaster and i jerked back, unintentionally taking the toaster with me. as soon as the weight of the toaster was off of the counter, it fell off my hand and plummeted onto my foot. cursing ensued. then i started to feel the pain in my hand. i looked at it, and it looked like i had set my hand down on a grill. between the pain in my hand and the pain in my foot, i said fuck the sandwich and sat on the couch, where i am now typing this post with one hand and no sandwiches.

 


edit - i appreciate people telling me about the fork thing, but in my adrenaline filled brain i just thought that it was a bad idea to stick a fork in a toaster. next time i decide to almost light my toaster on fire i'll be sure to remember a fork is fine in an unplugged toaster.

    Here is the summary: The author attempted to make a sandwich in a toaster but ended up almost lighting it on fire due to forgotten crumbs inside the toaster, resulting in burns to their hand and foot

    Here is the article: this fu happened last night while i was visiting my family over vacation (who also live 6+ hours away). i work in the restaurant business myself, so i felt bad for the workers, but i was also annoyed myself. 

 so we (myself, my uncle, aunt, 2 young cousins, my parents, younger brother and little sister: 9 in total) decide to go get dinner at this  little mexican spot in a local town near where we were staying. we made reservations for 7pm and got to the restaurant a little early.

 the hostess sat some other table at our reserved table like 20 minutes before we arrived so we don't actually end up sitting down until 7:20ish. it annoyed my aunt a lot but all the rest of us were just pretty hungry and wanted to eat so we didn't care too much.

 so the waitress comes over. she's this ditsy little 19 or 20 year old girl (under 21: she told us she couldn't recommend any drinks because it was illegal for her to drink). i could tell by just looking at her that this was gonna end up badly. she starts taking drink orders and ends up fucking up my aunts margarita order, but got all of our other drink orders right. no big deal right? 

 after half arguing with my aunt about the issue, she fixes the drink order and takes our food orders. we order a few appetizers and those come out eventually (it took a little longer than it should have, but they came nonetheless). by the time we finish up the appetizers it's been about 40 minutes (it's around 8:00 now).

 so another 20 minutes pass and we still haven't gotten our food. the bartender/manager started helping out (refilling drinks, extra napkins, etc.) and my aunt, uncle, and dad have had numerous each at this point. since taking our food orders, we hadn't seen the waitress come over for anything. 

 after another 15 minutes (it's after 8:30), the manager comes over and tells us that there was a computer glitch and our order wasn't processed into the kitchen (a common cover up in the restaurant business, meaning the waitress forgot to put in our order). at this point, my dad, aunt and uncle are getting really pissed off, as its been over an hour without our entrees.

 my aunt was told by the manager that her dish was gonna take a little longer to come out (she had some steak or something) after our order was finally processed, so my aunt said that she wanted to have her order cancelled. somehow, not only her order got cancelled, but my sisters order also got cancelled as well. so when the food finally came out, my sister and my aunt had nothing to eat, and my mom's dish was not at all gluten free, despite explicitly ordering a gluten free dish.

 to recap: we have been here for nearly an hour and 45 minutes, all the adults except for my mom are fairly drunk, and there have been numerous fuck ups involving food, beverages, and long wait times. 

 my dad and uncle make a huge fucking scene in front of the whole restaurant (they are both heavy set men who are nearly 300 pounds each and are nearly 7 feet tall). my dad stands up and starts swearing at the manager who brought the food out, my uncle is yelling and swearing, my mom is pissed off, my sister is in tears...

 he completely unleashed a drunken fury on the poor manager. he's screaming about how these people were "fucking him over" and "wasting his fucking time". the manager brings over boxes for the food that came out but my aunt refused to let any of us box up the food and she demands that we just leave.

 so my dad goes over to the manager and personally starts ripping into the guy, demands we get our bill for free and just keeps swearing. eventually he comes back over and sits back down (after i begged him to sit down and stop making a scene).

 the poor waitress comes over and asks how the food is. my dad just looks at the girl and bursts out laughing. my uncle looked at her and shouted "are you fucking kidding me? just go away".

 after that my dad and uncle walked out, so we all followed them. my mom and i apologized to the manager and the waitress twice personally and had to explain that they were just drunk and making a scene and he apologized for fucking the meal up. 

 as we are walking out the manager runs out of the restaurant and calls over my dad and uncle. apparently he thought that my uncle told the waitress to "fuck off" and he was basically prepared to call the police on us and the waitress was in complete tears.

when the miscommunication was cleared up, and after other failed attempts to find another place to eat (it was past 9pm, and most places were closed), we decided to just cut our losses and go back to the hotel. the night ended with eating popcorn and apples in the hotel room.

    Here is the summary: A family of 9 visited a Mexican restaurant during vacation, but their experience was marred by numerous mistakes and long wait times, leading to a drunken fury from the father and uncle

    Here is the article: this actually happened today and i’m still kicking myself.

i was applying for an internship through this online portal that lets you submit your resume and whatnot. it’s important to note that i’m limited to one application.

on my desktop, i have my resume, which is titled with my full name. i *also* have a picture of myself (just my head and shoulders, smiling at the camera), which is titled with my full name as well. why i thought it was a good idea to title them the same thing? i guess i figured they’re both about *me*, so they ought to be titled as such. dumb move.

so they prompt for my resume, i pop open the file explorer, navigate to my desktop, and there it is. a few clicks and i’m done! i’ve submitted the application and am about to leave the page when i realize — why does the submission have a .jpg attached?

looks like this particular opportunity is out of the picture now.

    Here is the article: tl:dr;  ran outside half naked in an attempt to save my daughter from a "burning building";  left my wife to "burn to death" on mother's day (not literally).

edit:  no one is dead, or even hurt for that matter.  apparently i have a knack for over dramatic  


this story happens at 2 am this morning.

i decided that i would give my wife a great mother's day weekend by taking her and our year and a half old daughter to the beach for the weekend.

in the room we have our daughters pack-n-play set up next to our bed, with a make shift barrier keeping her from being able to see us.

anyhow, we all go to bed last night absolutely exhausted and around 2 am, i'm startled awake by the fire alarm and this high pitched chirping!  my daughter immediately starts screaming and my wife is half awake freaking out.  well i do what i assume any father would do is leap from my bed, grab my daughter, and like an nfl running back, barrel out the hotel room door, out the side door of the hotel out onto the parking lot.  

so here i am, panting, making sure my daughter is okay when i being to realize where i fucked up.... 

....i am an itty-bitty pair of sexy briefs away from being buck naked.

i had totally forgotten that my wife and i had put on "a little show"  for each other last night and after sexy times, i slid my sexy underwear back on to fall asleep.  my wife.... oh shit i forgot my wife!  here i am, half nakely escaping the firey clutches of this hotel, and i completely forgot my daughters mother!  on mothers day!

this chirping had already stopped by time i was rushing myself and my daughter outside, so my wife, trying to get real clothes, had only made it as far as the hallway before they had came through and gave the all clear.  my daughter and i had to come back through the front entrance, and shamefully walk through the entire wing of the hotel, in front of everyone who peeked out of their rooms, with me in my sexy underpants... needless to say the looks and smirks were plentiful.

well... finally back at the room, my wife let me back into the room and expressed her gratitude that in the event of a real emergency, i would have saved our daughter, but sad that i would have left her burn with the pile of rubble that would be our hotel....

    Here is the summary: The author, in an attempt to save his daughter from a "burning building" on Mother's Day, ran outside half-naked, leaving his wife behind

    Here is the article: so this happened last night. it was my birthday (i'm in my final year in university), so my girlfriend and i invited three other friends to come stay in her one bedroom apartment. 

things were going relatively well: we go out for mexican food and margaritas, where i drink almost a full pitcher by myself. we then go home to continue celebrating. we play drinking games. i drink three beers. we get a bit too loud around 11pm so my gf tells us to quiet down and we do. we're good. 

well, then my friends start getting me to take shots. i end up taking probably 4 shots of whiskey before (apparently) going to bed to snuggle with up my gf and sleep. 

i say apparently, because the shots are the last thing i remember. of course, this is when i fuck up hard. 

i already have a history of parasomnia. so i get up (asleep) to go to the bathroom and pee. i make it to the toilet, but i miss for the entirety of the stream. so there's a puddle of piss on the floor and i kick the trash can. 

i then get in bed with my legs covered in pee while my gf goes to the bathroom to see what happened. she then comes to the bed and squats down by me to see what i did. still asleep, i yelled at her and pushed her down. 

she waited until the morning when i was sober, and she was beyond livid. she has not broken up with me, but she no longer trusts me when i'm drinking and assured me she will dump me if this ever happens again. she is now declining to go see the solar eclipse with me as well. 

i have never done anything violent in my life, so all of this was completely surprising to me. at this point i might just give up drinking liquor before my habits get worse.

    Here is the summary: The author had a birthday celebration with his girlfriend and friends, which involved drinking and led to him urinating on the floor and yelling at his girlfriend while still asleep

    Here is the article: names changed to protect identities.
 
i work for a company that clears tree branches from road sides. so we were clearing branches (as is our job description) and how it works is we cut the branches off the tree and then load them onto a dump truck to be hauled off and dumped into a pile elsewhere. usually during the branch dumps my crew takes a little break. during this break, one of my co-workers, we'll call him dan, had the idea that we could play a baseball game with the branches and walnuts. all of us thought it would be pretty funny, so we did it. another of my co-workers, he'll be greg, cuts a roughly straight, 2 inch in diameter branch so we can use as a bat. dan steps up to bat, he's a lefty and i'm directly to his right about 10 yards kinda out of the game, greg is the catcher, and our supervisor, toni, he's the pitches. toni pitches the walnut baseball at dan and dan smashes it to bits. another pitch form toni, and dan swings and the bat flies right out of his hands on a direct course to the side of my head. i see this and squat down as fast as i can. i close my eyes in disbelief as to what just happened. i'm not even sure what happened or if i got hit or not. i'm on the ground, crying, as greg laughs his guts out and dan and toni rush over to see if i'm alright. toni helps me up and throws the "bat" as far off the road as he can throw. i'm extremely shucking up and scared to death, my eyes are full of tears and everyone's looking at me seeing if i'm alright (except greg, he just continues to laugh). toni tells me that that branch came within about four inches of my head, and dan tells me i should become a ninja with my cat like reflexes. they all told me that none of them could have done what i did, as fast as i did.

    Here is the article: a few days ago, my mother in law said she was going to import some fancy fermented asparagus from spain for xmas appetizers, and asked me to make my wonderful aioli as a dip.  since i make this fairly often, i said, "sure!  no problem!" and promptly forgot about it.

my husband and i did our christmas thing, spent time with our baby (his first christmas!), went to in laws for breakfast, my parents for lunch, then home, where he told me i should think about making the aioli since his mom was expecting it.  i said sure, dismissing it a bit since i knew i could whip it up in like two minutes, and promptly showered the baby and took a nap.  a few hours later he comes into the bedroom and says we should head next door so we could start dinner.  i panic, since i hadn't started the mayo, and hand the baby off, and try to get dressed, blow dry my hair, and start the aioli.

as i'm blow drying my hair in the kitchen, i turn and knock the olive oil off the counter accidentally, and slip, holding the dryer and whisk in both hands.   i smash my face into the cabinet and spill the whole bowl onto myself, giving myself a black eye, and ruining the dip... and also dooming our kitchen to smell like garlic for the foreseeable future.

i got up, showered, wiped the floor with some paper towels, and whisked some garlic in a bowl with some hellman's and went to the in-laws.  they went out of their way to tell me how good my homemade mayo was.  they said nothing about my black eye.

    Here is the article: this happened over a decade ago when i was a very young kid, but it's still my favourite story to tell. 

growing up in a rural suburb in vietnam in the 90s, there wasn't much to do as a kid and being rather poor, my parents couldn't afford many toys for me to play with and keep me occupied. i did have one toy though, a red plastic sword which i took everywhere with me. when i wasn't pretending to be the greatest swordsman in all of asia, i used the sword to gently shank any animal that i wasn't afraid of, which was essentially just fish and ants, because i was a bit of a dick when i was a kid. 

there was a fire ant's nest inside one of the walls surrounding our humble little house where the fire ants would enter and exit very visibly through a fairly large crack. one day i decided to shove the end of the sword through the crack and see what would happen, the fire ants immediately went ballistic at the forced entry, emerged with military swiftness from the crack and scurried up the sword to attack their assailant. a few piercing bites from the fire ants and i surrendered, dropped the sword and ran back into the house. for some reason, i enjoyed this greatly and my sadistic self repeated this every single day; poking the fire ant's nest with the plastic sword, rallying their soldiers to come and fight me, getting bitten, jumping around at the pain and running away... i wish the story ended here but karma had much, much more dire plans for me. 

on a particularly hot day (even for vietnam), time was trudging along at a snail's pace. bored and hot out of my mind, i grabbed my sword and went to "fight" the fire ants. i drove the sword into the crack like i did every other day, but instead of the full blown red alert response, only a handful of fire ants showed up to protect their nest. disappointed, i dropped my sword and went back to find shade. seeing that i was struggling with the heat that day, my mother decided that she would run some cool water over me and ordered me into the shower room (i say shower room but it was just a corner in our stone basement with some pipes and a tap). i stood my short self under the tap and looked up longingly at the tap, awaiting the refreshment that i was about to receive. my mother turned the tap on and i could the hear water flow through the old pipes. i felt a revitalising torrent splash onto my face and body and i reveled in the bliss of the moment... for 3 seconds... then i felt something else, something on the opposite side of the spectrum. tiny, firey pains all over my body. turns out the fire ants had the same idea that i had to cool down and crawled their way into our cold shower pipes. the fire ants panicked from being flushed out from the pipes and attacked the closest thing to them but the pain they inflicted on me... it was like they knew it was me. each bite was like a tiny shiv coated in justice piercing my skin. i wouldn't be surprised if they had planned to infiltrate my shower pipes to ambush me at my most vulnerable: when i'm naked.

my cries of pain thundered throughout the house and i ran out of the basement flailing my arms about whilst butt naked. i got into the living room and collapsed, commencing the "stop, drop and roll" maneuver to try to get the pain to stop. my uncle and grandfather ran into the living room to see what was going on... and was completely unsympathetic to my plight and started laughing their arses off. although the sight of their nephew/grandson rolling frantically around, stark naked on the living room floor while crying his eyes out is pretty funny without the context, i guess. i caught them laughing through my tears and dealt with it the only way i knew how: i started rolling around even harder and cursed their mothers.

    Here is the summary: As a young child growing up in a rural Vietnamese suburb in the 90s, the author enjoyed poking a fire ant's nest with a plastic sword, rallying the ants to attack him, and then running away

my cries of pain thundered throughout the house and i ran out of the basement flailing my arms about whilst butt naked. i got into the living room and collapsed, commencing the "stop, drop and roll" maneuver to try to get the pain to stop. my uncle and grandfather ran into the living room to see what was going on... and was completely unsympathetic to my plight and started laughing their arses off. although the sight of their nephew/grandson rolling frantically around, stark naked on the living room floor while crying his eyes out is pretty funny without the context, i guess. i caught them laughing through my tears and dealt with it the only way i knew how: i started rolling around even harder and cursed their mothers.

    Here is the summary: As a young child growing up in rural Vietnam in the 90s, the author's favorite pastime was poking a fire ant's nest with a plastic sword, rallying the ants to attack him, and then running away

  i got to class and popped the tab. as i started to fall asleep, i took a sip. it was awful. i had no clue why people would drink this, but i was keeping awake  from just how bad it tasted.

  as class went on, i must have went through half of the can. the instructor released us for the day, and i wasn't  keeping the rest. i went to a nearby sink and poured it out. the rest of the drink came out in chunks. i got sick and threw up.

    Here is the article: the title is actually misleading. i’m the officer, and i was pranking a caseworker. where i work, officers are responsible for running the control centers, providing backup in case of emergency, and escorting/supervising inmates throughout the facility. caseworkers do all the work in a housing unit, like conducting searches, counts, monitoring/correcting inmate behavior, trying to convince them to do programming so they might be a better person when they get out, etc. 

well i just happened to get scheduled to work the control center in the most dangerous housing unit tonight. i am safe; i have an escape hatch and reinforced windows. the caseworker, however, has to walk onto the gallery to do his job. just to point out, 90% of inmates are chill, keep to themselves, and are even very respectful to staff. sure it’s dangerous, but not as bad as the media makes it seem. the one’s the cause issues are a minority, and this minority are usually sent to seg (basically a private cell with private programming because solitary proved to make people worse) after they do something, and if they behave in seg they get sent to this “test” gallery i’m watching, where if they behave themselves they are rewarded with access to general population (the rest of the inmates).

well, to make matters worse, we’re currently on extended lockdown because of a riot that happened, and this gallery has gotten the short stick because the guys who started it all came from here. even though the rest of them weren’t (directly) involved, they all have to remain on 23.5 hour lockdown, which sucks. so what happens when you get half a gallery (because the other half of the rooms are empty from all the rioters being sent to seg) full of pissed off, repressed inmates? you get a staff that accidently pops open all the doors. don’t worry, that isn’t my fuckup, but that happened and they almost started another riot.

so as i’m sitting making fun of that specific event, watching the caseworker do his count, i think it’ll be funny as hell to pop open all the empty cells. scared the shit out of him, i was laughing my ass off. i’ve never seen a large guy move that fast! not too long after, i get relieved and sent to the admin’s officer, where i was handed a statement of charges ( super write up). i should have known better than to pull a prank like that in a fucking prison, but hey, i’m human and want to scapegoat sleep deprivation on this one.

    Here is the summary: The officer in charge of the control center pranked a caseworker by opening all the empty cells, scaring him and causing the caseworker to move quickly

    Here is the article: this fuckup actually started on monday and came to its epic climax (literally) wednesday night.

my boyfriend and i went for a bike ride on monday afternoon, which is where the fuckup started when he took a curve a little too fast and went over his bike.  it was minor enough that he got right back up and rode the last few miles of our trip with no issue, so i didn’t give it much thought.  later that night, though, he mentioned he may have hurt himself and had a pretty gnarly bruise across his ribs/sternum area.  i tell him it will feel better in a few days and don’t think anything else of it.

tuesday night, though, he mentions he’s in a decent amount of pain and that he’s just going to take it easy and that we probably shouldn’t have sex.  “boo,” i think – but again, it will be better in a few days.

wednesday night he says he’s feeling better when he comes over to my place and we end up having some pretty rough, intense sex.  i’m talking candles lit, clothes thrown all around, blindfolds, belts, room just smells like fucking sex.  he gets his while i’m on top and i can tell that he’s hurting.  he’s trying to laugh it off but i’m accusing him of not being honest about how much pain he’s in.  he says he’s fine, he just needs to not move for a minute.  after a few minutes, he gets up to stretch and all of the sudden, he’s in agony.  he starts writhing on the bed and holding his chest and tells me that he’s not okay and that i should call 911.  he’s breathing so hard he’s almost hyperventilating, he’s clammy and sweaty and pale.  i’m trying not to panic, but….it’s at this point i should mention two things: one is that he is not the type to fuck with doctors, ers, etc.  the other is that he’s 14 years older than me – i’m in my late 20s and he’s just over 40.  we make jokes all the time about how he’s an old man and can’t keep up with me, but i’m actually convinced now that i’ve sexed him to death and he’s about to have a heart attack and die.  i call 911, get paramedics on the way and try to keep him calm while i try to get his underwear on (at this point, we’re both still completely naked).

the paramedics arrive quickly and i have to explain what’s going on.  i feel it necessary to add that it started while we were having sex because i’m still thinking he’s having some sort of heart issue.  he starts to calm down now that help is here and they take his vitals and do a quick physical exam.  we give them the full rundown of events since monday and they tell us it’s most likely a broken or fractured rib and that there isn’t a whole lot to be done, but that all of his vitals look fine.  it’s ridiculous and uncomfortable, but at least he’s not going to die in my bed.  we all have a good laugh, they leave….and my boyfriend proceeds to heat up some leftover chinese food and then we go to bed.  it was a memorable night.

    Here is the summary: The article describes a memorable night where the writer's boyfriend sustained a broken or fractured rib during sex, leading to a series of events that included a 911 call, a paramedic visit, and a good laugh

so a particular lady with whom i have been working with for the last 3 months (i've only been at this job for 3 months), but has been working at this particular location for about 3 yrs, is transferring to another location within the company. this lady was banking before i was even alive. like, before i was even thought of. she has done everything in banking you can think of! all of the customers love her and ask for her by name when they come in. she's basically our "bank mother", b/c she has all the answers to all of our questions. my bank manager leans on her a lot for wisdom and guidance. we are like a family and all work great together, so you can imagine how much we are going to miss her!
 
let me also preface this by saying that the whole "her leaving" thing has been a huge debacle. one of my other co-workers, who is part-time in the afternoons, was not privy to this information, as she was not here yesterday morning when this news was shared to the rest of us. our manager was also not included in the original conversation among the higher leadership about her transferring until the last minute. when he originally shared this info with us, he did not know that it was not official yet, but he was wanting to let us know before the new job posting email went out, b/c he knew everyone would be calling and asking us, and he wanted us to be able to field those calls and be in the know. just another example of everyday miscommunication. 
 
so yesterday afternoon, and i am fielding calls from other co-workers from other locations in the middle of our afternoon rush, and i have them all asking, "who is leaving?" little did i know, a job posting for our location just went out via email, while my manager was on lunch! (great! perfect timing!) he didn't even know it was being sent out!
 
i kept telling them all that i wasn't at liberty to say, because i wanted to respect my co-workers' privacy. they all understood and went about their merry way. so after i get off of the phone, i walk to the back where my part-time co-worker is at and make an off-hand comment about people calling and asking who is leaving. she says, "who's leaving?" at this point, i realize that no one has told her, and i had backed myself in a corner. i had a decision to make. tell her the truth and risk upsetting my co-worker who was leaving by violating her privacy and right to tell everyone, or act like i had no idea (hence, lie to her) and risk her being upset about it. 

now, i think the average everyday person would understand why i "lied" and acted like i didn't know for the sake of another's integrity...but no...not this girl. she is very sheltered, very opinionated, very blunt....everything is black and white, no grey area type of girl. very shy. socially awkward but not necessarily unfriendly type of girl. just sheltered. so you can imagine how hard she took this....

when my manager finally came and apologized to her about not telling her when he told everyone else, she realized that i lied to her  because i knew about it the whole time. that's when the shtf.

right there, in front of everybody, she walks back to her station, turns to me, and says, "don't ever lie to me. i can't handle that. i just lost all respect for you." not verbatim, but you get the idea. i tried to defend myself and say how i had done it to protect my co-workers integrity, but she wasn't having it and just kept cutting me off. her face was red and she was very emotional, and it looked like she was about to cry. so i just left it alone, and sat there pissed the rest of the afternoon, because she wouldn't hear me out....

this sucks, b/c we've kinda become friends and have hung out at their/our houses outside of work (we are both married) and have really enjoyed hanging out with them.

    Here is the summary: A long-time co-worker is transferring to another location, causing a "huge debacle" and upsetting the team

    Here is the article: last night and today i've been in a real spring clean bullshit kinda mood, so decided it was time to go through all of my stuff. yesterday was a great, got rid of loads of garbage and felt good about it. this morning i continued, and found some old letters, two from my ex, two from some girl i once chatted to, and one from a long time ago. i have been feeling a bit down recently, so decided maybe burning these letters would be therapeutic and help me feel a little bit better. they did, the flames really helped me put my mind at rest. however, i burnt them in a metal tin, and of course didn't think it through, with the metal tin directly on carpet.

i melted the entire carpet underneath the tin through to the underlay. i've since had to take a corner from the side of the room covered up and glue it in where the burnt carpet was.

    Here is the article: so today was my first day in work after the christmas holidays. i knew the office would be virtually empty so i skipped the usual shirt and tie combo and dressed down, complete with a pair of shiny wood-soled brogues. 

office is basically empty, so i drag out a few menial tasks while browsing reddit and do whatever i can to not fall asleep. 1pm rolls round and i head out to get some lunch - first stopping at a local boots pharmacy to pick up some essentials. 

as i'm heading out, i notice a woman approaching to enter the store. she's clearly pregnant - very large, and wearing one of those 'baby on board' badges so she'll get a seat on public transport. she's a distance away and carrying a large, full, cloth shopping bag but i caught her eye and now i feel obliged to keep the door open for her. 

now these doors are very narrow and for whatever reason ridiculously heavy and only open inwards. so from outside i have to move right over so the wide lady can get past. i'm so far away from the door that i can only open it a few inches and it's taking all of my effort and i'm regretting all my life choices because it looks pathetic but i can't just walk away now. the woman smiles and hurries as fast as her pregnant legs can take her. 

then i realise that i'm standing on polished marble. the sheer exertion it's taking to hold the door open a pathetic amount is causing me to slip away with increasing speed because of the stupid shoes i'm wearing. just as she's about the get through the door my legs slip out from under me entirely and i fall into her, cracking my right knee and elbow into the floor, instinctively grabbing her bag and yanking it away causing all her groceries (mainly fruit and veg) to scatter across the ground. she asks if i'm ok but looks a little annoyed, so i apologise profusely, pick up her things and return to the office sans lunch and bruised both physically and emotionally.

    Here is the summary: On my first day back at work after the Christmas holidays, I tried to hold open the heavy and narrow office door for a pregnant woman, but my poor footwear and lack of strength caused me to slip and fall, injuring my knee and elbow, and scattering her groceries all over the floor

sorry for the crappy story, i am now without a computer and am on mobile.

    Here is the article: i'll give a warning right here.  it's disgusting.  full of vomit pools, diarrhea, and maintenance workers.  and now we begin.

i don't like celebrating birthdays very much, even when it was my 21st.  i knew i was going to go out with a couple of good friends (we'll call them jack and his girlfriend jill from now on) and just make it a low-key evening.  

**11:30 p.m.** well we go downtown to one of the best streets in austin to go drinking; it's a 21-year-old's dream haven.  everything is dead, but we went into the first place we could find and i got to show the bouncer my i.d.  ahhhh the sweet release!... anyway, we start off with some long island teas and a patron shot.  the bartender is pretty generous and found out it was my birthday, so he literally poured equal parts of liquor and coke in a 12oz cup and then a free fireball shot to compliment that.  we were no more than 20 minutes downtown and i've already been given the equivalent of 6 drinks.  i knew i was gonna be smashed really soon.

**12:30 p.m.** we left the first bar and i'm pretty fucked (i'm also a featherweight in terms of size), and therefore a couple bars won't even let me in because i was so hammered, but we walk into this one place and an old friend is celebrating his birthday too! we hang out for a while, as my head is spinning like a beyblade. i can't tell if we had any more drinks at this point, i lost the memory.

*after this, any other times are made up, and the info is secondhand as reported by jack and jill.*

**~2:30 a.m.** puke. vomit. [etc.](http://www.thesaurus.com/browse/vomit) apparently we took a taxi back to my place, and first thing i do is splooge all over my shaggy carpet.  fuck.  and then again!  we make it to the bathroom, where jill has found her reverse-gender role as "holding my hair" as i vom.  i miss the toilet, puke all over myself and my bathroom floor (which is hardwood, if anyone was concerned).  jill, by jack's permission, unclothed me down to the underpants.  i'm rolling in my own vomit, losing all sight, memory, and motor control.  i reverted back to 4 year old ejecting whisky and stomach acid, and unfortunately hit jill in the crossfire.

i seriously can't imagine what it must have looked like, but jack sent me a generous [version of what i looked like](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/b4mayujccaexmb1.jpg).

**11:00 a.m.** i wake up and discover the mess. i ripped a shelf out of the wall and broke my soap dispenser.  it was really hot because the sun hits my windows perfectly.  it's like waking up in a sweatshop in havana, but with the rancid stench of vomit and pastor tacos (they *were* good).  first thing's first, take care of business on the other end.  i do my business and ready to flush, when i remembered that today my complex shut off the water for routine maintenance.  i have no water -my life source- to get me out of this.  i throw up about a dozen times before i crawl back into my puke riddled covers.  maintenance wakes me up, i tell him "i'm really sick," as if all the other clues weren't displayed enough.  he walks into my restroom and he nearly pukes himself, having to work on my toilet with all the unidentifiable contents inside.  another guy walks in, immediately says "sweet jesus" which almost made me laugh, but would've caused me to puke more.  before he left, i slightly opened my eyes to see him standing there at my bedroom door, scanning the room.  he was forever remembering the sight he walked in on.

the entire day goes by and i couldn't keep one sip of water down until 5 p.m.  i finally was able to figure out the story from jack, apologized for puking on jill, and got to enjoy the rest of my day wallowing in my own sick.  cleaning up everything was horrible, but i'm glad i have this great story immortalized on this site.

**11:00 a.m.** i wake up and discover the mess. i ripped a shelf out of the wall and broke my soap dispenser.  it was really hot because the sun hits my windows perfectly.  it's like waking up in a sweatshop in havana, but with the rancid stench of vomit and pastor tacos (they *were* good).  first thing's first, take care of business on the other end.  i do my business and ready to flush, when i remembered that today my complex shut off the water for routine maintenance.  i have no water -my life source- to get me out of this.  i throw up about a dozen times before i crawl back into my puke riddled covers.  maintenance wakes me up, i tell him "i'm really sick," as if all the other clues weren't displayed enough.  he walks into my restroom and he nearly pukes himself, having to work on my toilet with all the unidentifiable contents inside.  another guy walks in, immediately says "sweet jesus" which almost made me laugh, but would've caused me to puke more.  before he left, i slightly opened my eyes to see him standing there at my bedroom door, scanning the room.  he was forever remembering the sight he walked in on.

the entire day goes by and i couldn't keep one sip of water down until 5 p.m.  i finally was able to figure out the story from jack, apologized for puking on jill, and got to enjoy the rest of my day wallowing in my own sick.  cleaning up everything was horrible, but i'm glad i have this great story immortalized on this site.

    Here is the summary: The author celebrates their 21st birthday by going out with friends, drinking, and eventually vomiting and having diarrhea due to excessive alcohol consumption
    


    You will be given one summary written for a news article. Your task is to rate the summary based on the following criteria:

well the smart half of my brain decided it would be a good idea to ask if there's some other form of the word butt that i'm unaware of. obviously after i hit enter and said a few more related things, a director asked me to come to his desk and explain that it's definitely not on their website.

    Here is the summary: You installed a Chrome extension called "Cloud to Butt" that replaced all instances of "the cloud" with "my butt"

    Here is the article: this happened yesterday afternoon, i still cringe about it.... setting: college campus

my girlfriend's parents were in town and visited her, they even brought their old dog sadie to come down and visit since my girlfriend is absolutely in love with sadie.

i meet up with her and say hello to the parents. i pick-up sadie and say hello to her as well, she's got even more gray hairs on her than the last time i saw her. but she's running around like she's infected with rabies and going crazy, having the time of her life.

here's how this next conversation went leading to my fuck up.

parents: "she's been struggling to get around lately, she can't jump on the bed or couch anymore. it's weird to see her act so energetic."

me: "well that's good, how old is she nowadays?"

girlfriend: "i think she's close to being 9 now. she hasn't acted like this is months!"

**me: "yeah, i don't see her lasting that much longer...."**

girlfriend and her parents looked at me with this look of disbelief. 

parents: "well that was nice to hear...." 

girlfriend pulled me aside and smacks me on the arm.

girlfriend: "mike what the fuck."

me: "what did i do!!!" i said like a fucking idiot. 

i got smacked on the arm again.

girlfriend: "you just told me and my parents you think our dog will die soon! what the fuck is wrong with you."

me: ".....shit. that's not what i meant to say, i never finished my sen----"

girlfriend: "mike just talk to me later...." asking me to leave.

what i was trying to get at, was that i didn't see their dog staying hyper and energetic much longer today. that it would get tired and want to go home and sleep. 

what i meant to say was: "yeah, i don't her lasting that much longer out here, she must be getting tired."

    Here is the summary: The narrator made a thoughtless comment about the family dog being old and not lasting much longer, which was misinterpreted by his girlfriend and her parents as a prediction of the dog's imminent death

ok so the actual fuck up happened a year and two months ago approximately, but it kind of starts 3 years ago when i met this redhead near the end of my freshman year of high school. god she was amazing from the second i first saw her i could not stop looking at her, an hour and a half long train ride i was just stunned and i only spoke to her once we got off the train since we were all hanging out in a big group. that's first encounter. fast forward to summer of that year we both are in summer school to take abbreviated classes we don't want to take during the actual school year. we get pretty close hang out a lot, go out to eat a few times, still just friends though. throughout this year we get close, within 3 months were inseparable, i walk her to all her classes we are always late because we always talk to each other, i'd skip like half a period of double period class sitting with her at lunch, and during my lunch period i would go to her class (newspaper and i knew the teacher so she was fine with it). i want to say around june we both decide to hang out outside of school, specifically to get high together a habit i picked up during the new year and something she was interested in doing with me. we'd been hardcore flirting with each other the whole year, i remember one time i finished a double period test in one period, ran out to see her just as she was leaving and she was so happy to see me she literally bear hugged me and kissed me over and over and i spent 15 minutes in the halls with her. so yea we're walking around central park i'm smacked, she's somehow less smacked or not showing it considering it's her first time. i decide now to ask if she likes me and would go out with me. basically she says no not like that, i feel defeated, but then when we go back to school nothing has changed at all, still just as flirty etc. but she's established she's not into me so i suppress all my feelings, school ends, start junior year. this year we actually have a class together and her best friend sits just across from us so i become friend with her too. i still like her, i eventually confide this in her best friend who makes it her mission to get us together somehow. so it's like april of 2014 at this point of the story. i'm out at a party which is now winding down but i'm still pretty fucked up, i get a message from another girl that i know telling me that redhead is now way into me but isn't going to say anything because it seems i'm not into her anymore (suppressing my feelings). to shorten again i mentioned someone said something but didn't say what i pretty much let this go as some bs and that someone was trying to play me out for kicks. forward to november of 2014, now it's junior year, the redheads best friend sends me screenshots from a conversation not 15 minutes prior of the redhead saying she still likes me but doesn't think i like her and that she's telling her but she has to keep it a secret. let's call the friend napoleon from this point on. napoleon tells me i tell napoleon of course i'm still massively crushing on this chick, napoleons tells redhead, redhead says why he's not going to act on it, i see this and in a moment of preserving my image immediately decide that the very next day i will seek out redhead and ask her out. i tell napoleon this who tells redhead who is now freaking out mostly excitedly. now to the essential fuck up, aside from not being able to tell when a girl is sending me signals, who really can tho? i ask her out, we are both ecstatic and i proceed to fuck up twice after this to basicslly just destroy this relationship. few days after this we're having a dirty text convo from what i remember and me being probably the most retarded person on the planet goes "i love this". drop the l word 3 days in. i try my best to dismiss this as wrong person etc. things are awkward for a bit, but settle down. first date out to the met. god damn it was awkward but then we're back at her house, no 'rents, no siblings, we sit on the couch talk for hours literally inches from each other and over the course of this time she was wrapped me up with her legs (she's a bit taller than me like 6') and is making the nala sex eyes times 1000 at me. this could not be a more perfect set up to atleast kiss her if not do the deed, i might mention we hadn't turned the lights on since it was sunny when we came but now it was pretty dark. and i proceed to massively choke. i mean jesus no one will choke like this ever. i'm right there in her face to face looking directly in her eyes, and i get a call from my rents and instead of silencing it i get her off me, pick up the phone and say i'll be home soon maybe a few hours, which just kills the mood. so now we're both just sitting next to each other in awkward silence when she's like "so i guess you have to go now" and i just say yes. she walks me to the train station and i leave with a damn hug. we break up a few weeks later. later me her napoleon on some other chick. august 2015, all go out drinking and i get hammered enough to o bring this back up to which napoleon straight up tells me yea u fucked up by not making a move she was expecting you to and was so disappointed when you didn't. that's how i fucked up a good thing with the girl of my dreams.

i ask her out, we are both ecstatic and i proceed to fuck up twice after this to basicslly just destroy this relationship. few days after this we're having a dirty text convo from what i remember and me being probably the most retarded person on the planet goes "i love this". drop the l word 3 days in. i try my best to dismiss this as wrong person etc. things are awkward for a bit, but settle down. first date out to the met. god damn it was awkward but then we're back at her house, no 'rents, no siblings, we sit on the couch talk for hours literally inches from each other and over the course of this time she was wrapped me up with her legs (she's a bit taller than me like 6') and is making the nala sex eyes times 1000 at me. this could not be a more perfect set up to atleast kiss her if not do the deed, i might mention we hadn't turned the lights on since it was sunny when we came but now it was pretty dark. and i proceed to massively choke. i mean jesus no one will choke like this ever. i'm right there in her face to face looking directly in her eyes, and i get a call from my rents and instead of silencing it i get her off me, pick up the phone and say i'll be home soon maybe a few hours, which just kills the mood. so now we're both just sitting next to each other in awkward silence when she's like "so i guess you have to go now" and i just say yes. she walks me to the train station and i leave with a damn hug. we break up a few weeks later. later me her napoleon on some other chick. august 2015, all go out drinking and i get hammered enough to o bring this back up to which napoleon straight up tells me yea u fucked up by not making a move she was expecting you to and was so disappointed when you didn't. that's how i fucked up a good thing with the girl of my dreams.

    Here is the summary: You met a redheaded girl in high school, became close friends, and developed romantic feelings for her, but you failed to act on your feelings and ultimately lost the opportunity due to a series of missteps and awkward moments

    Here is the article: after purchasing a small amount, i headed to walmart to buy some pop for the house. on my way i could not find my weed though. so i thought maybe i left it at the "dudes" house. i call him an no luck. i hadn't gotten very far and thought it may have fell out of my pocket getting in or out of the vehicle. so i turn around and park near my last parking spot. check the car and the ground and still no luck. i say "fuck it!" i'm going back into walmart. i was ready to accept the loss, but since i only made one purchase and was in there a short period of time. it didn't hurt to look. i retrace my steps to self checkout and low and behold my weed is laying in the floor dead center of the self checkout. the attendant was at the same register i used and was helping a customer out. people were behind me but i just pick it up as quick as possible, put it in my pocket, and head for the door. on my way out i call the dude back to let him know i wasn't coming back to buy more weed and what i just typed here. once i get home, i get to my room which is a mess because i'm cleaning and rearranging it. i start to clean and after about thirty minutes i was gathering my bowls and whatnot into a shoebox. i reach in my pocket and it's gone again. i can't remember if i hid it immediately when i got home or if it fell out of my pocket again from walmart to my bedroom. i searched for about an hour in my house, yard, and car. no luck. i thought maybe it fell out again when i pulled my phone out to call dude walking back to the car. so i drive to walmart. search the parking area and where i walked and i can't find it. i'm typing this at walmart. hoping it pops up at the house. otherwise i'll be buying more...



 

before anybody ask...it was a very small amount in a tiny bag that kinda look like trash on the ground. easy to miss.

    Here is the summary: After losing my small amount of weed in various locations, I retraced my steps, searched my home, yard, and car, and even drove back to Walmart to look for it, but it remains lost and I may have to buy more

    Here is the article: so, i have been dating this girl for roughly 9 months and today, she told me that she was going to see her mom for money... i was already a bit skeptical knowing that one, her mom is flat broke and doesn't have a job... so naturally, me not thinking straight, decided to follow her. (i know, it sounds creepy, but wouldn't you want to know the truth with that shady of a story??) so anyways, i followed her at a decent pace and as far as i know, she didn't suspect a thing. but then, things got much, much worse. i got to about 20 minutes of driving and all of the sudden, she stopped at a hotel, i was on the tips of my toes with fright. i was thinking to myself, "what the hell will i do if i see this guy!? should i confront them? do i just let them go and wait until i get home to confront her??" none of these happened, however. i pulled into the lot next to the motel and waited, 11 minutes passed (guessing) and then the other car pulled up. i was ready to die right then and there, but then the worst thing happens: a woman steps out with a man and they begin to talk. i couldn't hear anything, as the dumb spy in me said not to even try it. they turn around after a bit and walk. directly towards where i am at! oh shit. i'm caught. she stops by my car and me being already red faced, turn to her and act surprised. she doesn't buy it... so here i am, red still, in that said parking lot, discussing what precisely i was doing here. i'm writing this in hopes that everything will turn out okay... but the future looks a bit bleak at this point.

    Here is the article: this was a fuck up i had about 1-2 years ago, i don't have any recent ones so i thought i'd post this one.

it was lunch-time in comprehensive school (high school) and we're just chilling outside, fucking about like the immature year 9'ers we are. i can't remember much about what happened but i started calling my friends gf a bitch just as a joke, she got pretty annoyed, it was more of a teasing thing. then my friend picked up a stick and threw it at me, i don't think he intended for this but the stick nailed me in my eye, popping a blood vessel.

i've never had so much pain in my eye before.

i went to the opticians and they told me i had a splinter in my eye and would have to go to a&e (accident & emergency) to get it removed. me and my dad waited there for about 5 hours, until we finally got in and the splinter and fell out already. he then gave me cream to rub in my eyes for the next 3 days.

moral of the story: don't call your friends girlfriend a bitch, even as a joke.

    Here is the summary: Don't call your friends' girlfriends a bitch, even if it's just a joke, because it can lead to physical harm and a painful experience, as the author learned the hard way when his friend threw a stick at him after he teasingly called his GF a bitch

    Here is the article: background: i am a sales manager and have been doing the job 3 years. despite being quite inexperienced i am doing really well but have been a bit overworked in the last few weeks leading me to be less thorough than usual. 

&nbsp;


my manager asks me to take a client meeting while he is away. i was pleased to be asked because he usually asks someone more senior. i carefully drew up the agenda and booked meeting rooms, hospitality, hotel rooms for the clients etc. i had it all under control and this was my chance to shine. this morning i get to work as usual, i’m in my regular smart/casual attire, i don’t wash my hair because i’ll do it tonight so it looks good for tomorrow. i get to my desk and open my emails. i’ve been working away so there’s a lot to get through, i make some good progress and then the phone rings.  
*receptionist: no1saleswoman your visitor are in reception*   
*no1saleswoman: i’m sorry, what visitors? i’m not expecting anyone today.*   
i turn white as a sheet and realise that i have made all the arrangements for tomorrow and they are here today. i curse them and ask my colleague for help, she heroically finds a meeting room and rearranges everything. i try to find my colleague who is joining the meeting. he isn’t on site today so we make a plan for him to dial in. i go to the meeting room and they are updating the video conferencing equipment! i find a second meeting room (throwing out another meeting!) and get set up. by this time the clients have been waiting downstairs for 20 minutes. i take a deep breath, go and get them and the meeting goes ahead. in the end it didn’t go that badly, but i definitely gave a very bad first impression to the clients. 

&nbsp;

after lunch i go back to my office and everyone has heard about what i did. i laugh it up but secretly want to cry. my big chance to prove to my boss that he can rely on me and i get my days mixed up. turns out they changed the date; i updated the agenda but not my outlook calendar.

    Here is the article: you already know this didn't happen today. but today i saw a thread about the stupidest things you were punished for at school on /r/askreddit and it reminded me of this story. as i was writing my reply i thought it would work better as a tifu as hey, detail!

when i was in year 7 (aged 11/12) my school held a mock election campaign as the real uk elections were taking place and they wanted to give the students a chance to see how they worked and what they were all about. so various people in the upper school became party leaders and they all ran campaigns to get the students to vote for them. one of these campaigns was a run of posters which popped up around the school. seriously, there were so many posters. 

so one of these posters was on an out of the way doorway and it just so happened that the last name of the liberal democrat "candidate" was irresistably punable. his last name was "issa." so a friend of mine decided that it would be cool to write "sheep," after his name. issa sheep. lol he's a sheep. i know, it's not that funny really, but in our 11 year old minds we were the cleverest comedians in the entire school. so we wrote sheep on that poster and went off in high spirits. 

we'd already scribbled something else (i forget what) on another nearby poster, but the photocopier had made the background of that one mostly black so it was barely readable. we ran up a short flight of stairs to check if it was still there and then ran back down. 

that was our mistake. if we'd continued up the staircase we'd have been in the clear. but as soon as we got down again we heard a yell. staring down the corridor towards the science department we saw our catastrophically overweight head of chemistry marching towards us. this guy was known as the shouter of the teachers. you didn't want to get on his bad side and we just had. after a few minutes of yelling he sent us to the teacher running the election campaigns and our form tutor. the teacher running the campaigns was usually really cool, the sort of teacher who is that rare combination of really good and fun (he once taught a lesson about the roman emperors while standing on top of his desk to make himself feel more like an emperor while teaching). anyway, because of this his punishments were usually on the unusual side of things.

the long and the short of it was we were both given liberal democrat support badges to wear which we had to sport on our school blazers for the remainder of the campaign. we also had to apologise to the campaign leader (who looked entirely bewildered but said it was okay). our form tutor had other punishments in mind. we were both given a lunchtime detention where we had to write essays on "tha value of school rules" and "the value of democracy," now we were eleven. neither of us knew exactly what democracy meant. so after a short lesson in democracy we got on with those essays. 

but the punishments didn't stop there. our old friend and head of chemistry convened with the history teacher running the campaigns and after the election we were given a task. we were to take down every single election poster. any we missed we would be given a detention for. we circled the entire school and sixth form centre (and were yelled at a few times by prefects to put the posters back after we'd taken them down). we were pretty sure we'd got them all when we finally could take off our badges and return to being normal, non lib dem supporting eleven year olds. 

it turned out we'd missed 3, but somehow we found them before the head of chemistry did. they were in the canteen. i remember noticing them one lunchtime a few days later and grabbing them as fast as i could. somehow we both managed to get through this experience without actually getting an after school detention which meant that our files stayed clean. (well, mind did, he got a detention for writing on a tree a few years later).

    Here is the summary: When we were 11 years old, we were punished for writing "sheep" after a candidate's name on a school election poster, which led to a series of unusual punishments, including wearing Liberal Democrat support badges, writing essays on the value of school rules and democracy, and taking down every election poster in the school
    


    You will be given one summary written for a news article. Your task is to rate the summary based on the following criteria:
    Output format: PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE

    Evaluation Criteria:
    1. Read the news article carefully and identify the main topic and key points.
    2. Read the summary and compare it to the news article. Check if the summary covers the main topic and key points of the news article, and if it resents them in a clear and logical order.
    3. Rate the summary with 5 percentages, where each one represents how likely the summary is going to get a score from 1 to 5. For example, if you think the summary is 80% likely to get a score of 5, 10% likely to get a score of 4, 5% likely to get a score of 3, 3% likely to get a score of 2, and 1% likely to get a score of 1, you should rate the summary as 80, 10, 5, 3, 2.

    Here is the article: you already know this didn't happen today. but today i saw a thread about the stupidest things you were punished for at school on /r/askreddit and it reminded me of this story. as i was writing my reply i thought it would work better as a tifu as hey, detail!

when i was in year 7 (aged 11/12) my school held a mock election campaign as the real uk elections were taking place and they wanted to give the students a chance to see how they worked and what they were all about. so various people in the upper school became party leaders and they all ran campaigns to get the students to vote for them. one of these campaigns was a run of posters which popped up around the school. seriously, there were so many posters. 

so one of these posters was on an out of the way doorway and it just so happened that the last name of the liberal democrat "candidate" was irresistably punable. his last name was "issa." so a friend of mine decided that it would be cool to write "sheep," after his name. issa sheep. lol he's a sheep. i know, it's not that funny really, but in our 11 year old minds we were the cleverest comedians in the entire school. so we wrote sheep on that poster and went off in high spirits. 

we'd already scribbled something else (i forget what) on another nearby poster, but the photocopier had made the background of that one mostly black so it was barely readable. we ran up a short flight of stairs to check if it was still there and then ran back down. 

that was our mistake. if we'd continued up the staircase we'd have been in the clear. but as soon as we got down again we heard a yell. staring down the corridor towards the science department we saw our catastrophically overweight head of chemistry marching towards us. this guy was known as the shouter of the teachers. you didn't want to get on his bad side and we just had. after a few minutes of yelling he sent us to the teacher running the election campaigns and our form tutor. the teacher running the campaigns was usually really cool, the sort of teacher who is that rare combination of really good and fun (he once taught a lesson about the roman emperors while standing on top of his desk to make himself feel more like an emperor while teaching). anyway, because of this his punishments were usually on the unusual side of things.

    Here is the article: today was a normal day in my house. i was being lazy, so i went into my fridge (shared by the family) and i pulled out a carton of apple juice. i thought to myself, i'm lazy, and we're all family, so i'll just down the carton and throw it out. i drank out of the carton, and had most of the apple juice out of it.

no problem.

then i had the brilliant idea to reuse the carton by putting water in it because the fridge has a cold water dispenser near the handle. i pour a bit in not paying attention, and walk back to my room, sipping a bit of the water from the carton. and for some reason it taste funny. and then i felt some kind of chunks. and the chunks then moved. in my mouth. i spat what little i had in my mouth onto the floor, then booked it to the sink where i rinsed out the carton and my mouth to find dozens of ants.

i retested the water dispenser in the fridge. it was clean. i still have no idea where the ants came from. or if they were in the carton with the apple juice and i just didn't notice.


i'm going to be drinking bottled water for the next probably lifetime.

    Here is the article: hey guys. this actually happened almost exactly 24 hours ago, as is tradition.


anyways, i work the night shift at a local allsup's (convienant store chain in the southwest us). yesterday, i went to clean the bathroom and make mop water so i can mop the store. so far so good, but amidst all the cleaning and moving of mop buckets, i had set down my phone and wallet that were in my pockets. that's the main part of the fuck up.


so, i finish cleaning, grab my phone, and go to make coffee and start breakfast. now, for more backup, i almost always put my phone in my front right pocket, and my wallet in my front left pocket. for a reason only god knows at tbis point, i put my phone in my left pocket, and forgot to grab my wallet, as i was focused on work, and was not paying great attention. about 15 minutes pass, and a customer comes in, and asks to use the restroom, and i tell him where it is. 


well, apparently, my wallet was there. the customer must have seen the wallet on the ground, taken out the $123 cash i had in it, then set the wallet on the toilet paper dispenser. he came to the front, bought a brisk tea (not even a good one, too.), then, as he was leaving said "hey, someone dropped a wallet back there." instinctively, i patted my pocket, felt my phone, and felt my heart plummet. i ran to the bathroom, saw my wallet, and opened it to see the cash was gone. i was heartbroken. 


i know it's my fault, but it sucks. i don't normally have cash, but i had just cashed a tax return check, and was going to give it to a friend so they could order me my first mechanical keyboard. i've learned my lesson, though. don't keep large amounts of money on myself, and always triple check yourself, even if you have habits.

    Here is the summary: The author made the mistake of leaving their wallet in the bathroom at work, and a customer took advantage of the situation by stealing $123 cash from it

    Here is the article: tifu a few years ago. 



so i enjoy taking my suzuki 600 out alone. i'm not really a stunter so i prefer not having the pressure of other speed demons on the open road. especially since everyone i know with a bike is way too hardcore. the human brain dictates 'if you have the opportunity to do something stupid and peer pressure is involved, you *will* do it." thus, i like to cruse solo. well around 5 pm one day my buddy calls to go on a run. he has a cbr 1000 and is known as "loco". you see where this is going. i agree since i'm pretty bored and we hit the express way. we start of slow hitting the usual bends and corners. there's a strip in my city that is completely straight for about 15 miles. when we come off the bend to the strait, i open the throttle all the way up in 6th gear. keep in mind i have a 600, he has a 1000 and we are flying at maybe 120mph. he looks over to me, shifts up and takes off. around 6 miles down i catch up and he is on his back pegs wheelied and signals we are taking the next exit. 




he comes down to both wheels and i slow down to take the exit but i notice he doesn't slow down any further so i decide to keep his pace. we are basically knee dragging this exit ramp curving to the left. that's when i notice him drifting right, towards the wall. i'm thinking, *stop looking at the wall, stop looking at the wall!* bam. he hits the wall. now i have a decision to make; finish the turn and some how make it back to him (on the e way) or try and stop. i hit both brakes, turning my bike into a surf board. bam. i hit the wall right behind where he hit. i'm now sliding down the street, shit is catastrophic. 




gliding to a not-so-graceful stop, i do a quick pat down. all my arms and leg are here. shoes: missing. i run over to my buddy and he's pealing himself off the wall. it's hilarious now, but at the time i was freaking out. his entire right side was jacked up but nothing too bad. except he lost his pinky toe from it grinding against the wall. we ended up riding home, broken and defeated by the night. and i was once again reminded of the dangers of riding with people named "loco".

    Here is the article: so this actually happened today, throwaway for obvious reasons. i recently moved house and only now got around to setting up cable/internet. thinking the cable guy would only need to be in the living room, and not my bedroom, i didn't think to put away my rabbit-shaped friend after some private fun-time earlier this morning. i had completely forgotten about it, so when he said he needed to check the phonejack-thing in the bedroom, i didn't think twice about letting him go in and do whatever it is he needed to do to set up the internet. after checking that he found the phonejack ok, i went back to the living room to do some work of my own. when he came back into the living room, he was sweating quite a bit, and almost ran out of the apartment, saying he had to get something or other from his truck. he came back about 10-15 minutes later, not looking me in the eye at all, and started working to set everything up, making what i though was innocent conversation. after about the third time i was asked what i like to do on my own in my free time, while he was looking down my shirt, i realised i left my toy out in the open, and there was no way he would have missed it. to make matters worse, i had been playing some relaxing  but cheesy saxophone music, and had probably made the poor guy even more convinced he had walked onto the set of a cheesy porno.

    Here is the article: so this actually happened today, throwaway for obvious reasons. i recently moved house and only now got around to setting up cable/internet. thinking the cable guy would only need to be in the living room, and not my bedroom, i didn't think to put away my rabbit-shaped friend after some private fun-time earlier this morning. i had completely forgotten about it, so when he said he needed to check the phonejack-thing in the bedroom, i didn't think twice about letting him go in and do whatever it is he needed to do to set up the internet. after checking that he found the phonejack ok, i went back to the living room to do some work of my own. when he came back into the living room, he was sweating quite a bit, and almost ran out of the apartment, saying he had to get something or other from his truck. he came back about 10-15 minutes later, not looking me in the eye at all, and started working to set everything up, making what i though was innocent conversation. after about the third time i was asked what i like to do on my own in my free time, while he was looking down my shirt, i realised i left my toy out in the open, and there was no way he would have missed it. to make matters worse, i had been playing some relaxing  but cheesy saxophone music, and had probably made the poor guy even more convinced he had walked onto the set of a cheesy porno.

    Here is the summary: The author allowed a cable technician into their bedroom to set up internet, unaware that they had left a rabbit-shaped toy out in the open, which the technician likely saw and may have mistaken for a sex toy

    Here is the article: i guess, as most people do, i have to say that this didn't happen today but around this time in 2003, i was 16.

so it was coming up to my gcse exams (last compulsory exams for school kids in uk). my dad and mum were always onto me about revising. it would annoy the hell out of me; "just leave me alone i'll revise just fine". anyway, my dad has this major go at me for not revising properly and takes my ps2 off me. i go back up to my room, absolutely fuming, and as i walk in i turn my light switch on. only, i hit it with a clenched fist and crack the main square of plastic. i shit a brick and start thinking of what to do. i go tell my dad i'm popping to the shops to get some pens and pencils etc . . . for revision; this works. phew!

i go buy a new light switch for a couple of quid along with some stationery. get back to my room and proceed to change the cracked switch for the new one. i take the old switch off, no problem. i go to start attaching the wiring to the new one and as i grab one of the wires my whole body starts to vibrate it felt like i was sitting on a really shit washing machine. i managed to let go after what felt like 10 seconds (probably a second in reality) and calm myself down. i then went, tail between my legs, to my dad to tell him what had happened. he called me an idiot for not turning off the power to the upstairs and fixed the light switch for me. 
i still remember that electric shock feeling. . . scary as shit.

    Here is the summary: When I was 16 and in the midst of my GCSE exams, I was reprimanded by my dad for not revising enough, and as a result, he took away my PlayStation 2 and I was left alone in my room feeling frustrated

    Here is the article: so let me be clear, i am a kanye west fan and really like his music.  whether or not i am correct is an entirely different matter, but for now, let's agree to disagree.

my dad and i were watching game 7 of the nba finals together.  we've been catching all the games as, we both like it, and it makes for some good father-son time (me: 23 years old, college grad living at home, but employed, for which i'm grateful).  after an exciting first half, during the start of tv analysis, my dad asked, "hey, can i hear some of that kanye west?" 

tifu because i said yes.  here's what happened.

i had been talking a lot about kanye in the last few days.  i really liked the symphonic and grandiose parts in his last record, and "yeezus," his album that came out this last tuesday, had subverted his previous record so much i was on a "literary-critique high."  i had tried to explain to my dad how this new record was so experimental.  so first, i decided, i should play him my favorite song off his last album, "[all of the lights](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2a_wma5asss)."

my dad seemed to enjoy this.  he agreed that it was different from the rap he's heard, which, to be honest, is certainly not a lot.  so then, in my brilliant idea was to show him the first track off of "[yeezus: on sight.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53gawwemol8)"  this second song, is, lyrically, kanye being just about as obscene/ as much of an asshole as ever.  i like the song because of that, in part, and because of its crazy instrumentals.  

well, my dad did not take this well.  "what did he say?" he said, asking for clarifications on lines like, "black dick up in your spouse again," "no sports bra, let's keep it poppin'," and "but i got her back and i put my dick in her mouuuuthh."

suffice to say, he was not impressed by this "creativity," or however the fuck i had hyped it up.  the second half of the nba game was pretty silent.  

kanye, i dig it, but damn... just damn...

    Here is the summary: The author's father was not impressed with their choice of music during Game 7 of the NBA Finals, as the author played a Kanye West song with explicit lyrics

around in there an hour later, but it was so 
late i thought "fuck it, he can take some 
toilet paper, i'll clean it up in the morning"

daylight hits, and i walk into the kitchen to 
cook some breakfast, i notice my dog 
curled up in the corner of the living room
with his blanket and a few pieces of used 
toilet paper he took from the bathroom. 
all the toilet paper i use to wipe my ass i
toss into the toilet, so i figure i'll just pick 
up his little tp collection and toss it back it. 

so i reach over and grab the toilet paper...
and to my absolute horror, in my hand i 
held my sisters used tampon covered with 
bits of toilet paper (the pieces of toilet 
paper were not big enough to stop my 
hand from making contact...). my dog 
chose my sisters used tampon to cuddle
with.

    Here is the article: actually happened today!  

at my school, there are 6 different scedules: it goes day 1, day 2, etc.  every day 6 during 2nd period, our whole grade meets in the theatre and discusses things.  since this is day 6 and the last class meeting before winter break, the teachers decided to play a fun "telephone" game (for those who don't know telephone is where you whisper a word or phrase into someone's ear, they whisper it into the next person's ear, and goes on for a while; the end result is normally funny).  during the first game everything went fine, but during the second game, i was the last person and was *planning* on saying the final thing.  since this is a class of around 300 people, teams were around 20 people large and the phrases were not whispered but instead put on sheets of paper.  the kid at the end of our row took the paper and proceeded to show it to the entire row, ruining the game for us and getting our team disqualified.  i went over there and told him my mind, eventually was told to go back to my seat.  i was so upset.

the next bad thing that happened was that the teacher orchestrating it decided to read all the answers.  someone put "[star wars spoiler]" for their answer, the teacher read it, and immediately the entire theatre erupted with "boo!"s and "no!"s.  we left the theatre and eventually everyone figured out who it was.  i went up to this kid (who already had a crowd around him yelling at him) and put him into a headlock and almost got him to the ground before i was pulled off of him.  then people proceeded to chase him around the school, everyone hated him so much.  i went back to our class' lounge, then one of my deans called me into her office (the offices of the class deans are inside the class lounge).  she said that even though everyone was upset that what i did was wrong.  later i heard that he was crying in the library during 3rd period, and my reaction was "good!", although that was probably not the right one.  i have 6th period geometry honors with him, and he came up to me and said "i'm so sorry, etc.".  it finally began to dawn on me that this kid was just playing a joke and didn't expect everyone's reactions to be this hostile; i started to feel bad.  near the end of 6th period our math teacher decided to hand out mini candy canes to us and star wars spoiler kid offered me his.  at this point i decided was a good time to apologize, i said "listen, star wars spoiler kid, i'm sorry for what i did after class meeting.  i don't forgive you for what *you* did, but i am sorry about what i did".  now i'm in 7th period typing this.

    Here is the article: this happened a couple of days ago but was only realised today.

so i couldn't be bothered to buy a decent computer so i play modpacks on my laptop. since it can't run big packs i tend to join servers or play light packs like agrarian skies or regrowth. 

this time i used curse to build a custom lite modpack which included botania and agricraft in it. 

as i was progressing pretty far into agricraft i started on the botania flower seeds. realising i would need podzol and the only place to get that was a mega taiga i jumped on chunkbase to find where the closest one was.

apparently the seed i had there was none within 1000 blocks and so i decided to cheat it in. the goody 2 shoes within me relinquished control to the dark side and typed that game changing command, literally. 

only to discover this command is not available. when i had loaded my world i turned cheats off for this very purpose. however it was vital i got this podzol.

i decided opening to lan was my best option so i opened to lan. turned cheats on. and as if by magic had a new stack of podzol.

now my computer is set to do nothing if the charger is in and the lid is shut so that i can afk. now i had things to do so i paused the game. shut my charging computer. and left.

today i opened my laptop to see minecraft open with me dead and was very confused until i remembered the above and weeped as not only could i not figure out where i died but i lost the very thing that made me cheat in the first place

 
ng. thought it was paused and lost the very item i cheated in to begin with

    Here is the summary: The player was playing Minecraft on their laptop and used cheats to obtain podzol, but then forgot to turn off cheats before pausing the game, resulting in them dying and losing the podzol

apparently the seed i had there was none within 1000 blocks and so i decided to cheat it in. the goody 2 shoes within me relinquished control to the dark side and typed that game changing command, literally. 

only to discover this command is not available. when i had loaded my world i turned cheats off for this very purpose. however it was vital i got this podzol.

i decided opening to lan was my best option so i opened to lan. turned cheats on. and as if by magic had a new stack of podzol.

now my computer is set to do nothing if the charger is in and the lid is shut so that i can afk. now i had things to do so i paused the game. shut my charging computer. and left.

today i opened my laptop to see minecraft open with me dead and was very confused until i remembered the above and weeped as not only could i not figure out where i died but i lost the very thing that made me cheat in the first place

 
ng. thought it was paused and lost the very item i cheated in to begin with

    Here is the summary: I was playing Minecraft on my laptop with a custom lite modpack that included Botania and Agricraft, and I needed podzol to progress in Agricraft

    Here is the article: this just happened a few hours ago. a little back story, i (24/m) have been dating my girlfriend now for almost 6 years.  she is the same age as i.  her brother as well as my brother (both older)  are getting married later this year.  so now at all family functions i get asked when will you propose xxsnipeshow99xx. this is where the fuck up begins. 

she has been working a lot lately and i have not been and won't be for another 2 weeks due to a broken hand.  that's another story.  well i thought what better time to propose than now.  so while she was working i went and picked out the perfect ring.  which she got suspicious about because i from canada bought it in the states so my phone was shut off for the duration of the trip (damn roaming charges). well just about my entire family knew i bought the ring besides my girlfriend.  this was last week. 

fast forward to today.  my brother texts me "sooooo, did you do it yet?"  so i text back " nah she works every night besides thursday so imma do it thursday unless i chicken out like a baby back biiiiitch". yes i wrote biiiiitch, lol.  well a few minutes go by and i realised he hasn't texted back. so i look at my phone and my stomach turned.  i actually sent that text to my girlfriend.  so i spammed her with texts and calls hopefully to bury it all while saying "don't look at your messages".  well as you can guess she looked at it during her work meeting. 

so i sat there panicking,  not knowing what to do.  called my brother and mother who both couldn't stop laughing.  my original plan was to fill my truck bed with tons of pillows and park in the middle of no where with a glass of wine staring at the sky, with her dog as well.  sappy and simple which is perfect. yup, that plans out the window.  so she is coming home in less than 2 hours i had to think fast.  she thinks i'm proposing thursday so i'll just do it today, perfect. still a surprise but she works tonight at 10pm .  so now i need a new plan. i'm sitting on her bed with her room filled with white balloons. one pink balloon i put the ring in and will tie it to her dog, while i'm dressed to impress. still good and i did it in less than 2 hours.  double fuck up,  her dog is scared of balloons and won't go anywhere near this pink balloon. so now i sit here in defeat, typing this waiting for her to come home in a few minutes to her dog panicking as bad as i was panicking earlier.  the worst part is i'll never forget this. even if she says yes anytime someone asks how i proposed i'll have to tell them about how tifu.  

 

edit -  fixed all my 'purpose'  to 'propose'. also she said yes! i told her my original plan of how i wanted to and she would have rathered that but she said yes either way so alls good.

    Here is the summary: The author, a 24-year-old man, tried to propose to his girlfriend of six years by buying a ring in the States and hiding it in a pink balloon, but he accidentally sent a text message to his girlfriend instead of his brother, revealing his proposal plans

    Here is the article: this actually happened about 15 years ago, but it remains one of the dumbest and most painful things i've ever done.  i think it belongs here.

i was living in chapel hill with a girl who worked as a delivery driver for a chain pizza place.  chain, but not super corporate.  top to bottom, it was a really laid back operation and i partied with the people she worked with and got to know the crew pretty well.  

this one time, i lost every identifying piece of paper in my life.  passport, birth cert., social security card, driver's license, etc. which, if you've ever done that, you know it is its own tifu, but never mind that.  i had to go to the dmv.  i didn't know how to get to the dmv, but i knew the address and i knew where there was a giant wall-sized map of the roads that i would need to travel.

so, i roll into the pizza place to look at the map and start shooting the shit with the staff and i get invited into the manager's office to smoke a joint.  nobody wants to be sober and go to the dmv, so i accept the invitation.  now i'm quite high and the creative side of my brain is in full effect when it's time for him to get back to work and me to get down the road.  as we are gathering ourselves to leave the office, this dude breaks out an aerosol can of what i can only describe as a most heavenly and authentic orange spray and it miraculously conceals the scent of our shared doobie.  i didn't know humankind had ever created something so divine.

my left brain says "yes, that.  i want to smell like that."
my right brain says "he may have a point.  you might not want to roll into the dmv smelling like that joint you just hotboxed in the pizza office."

why i chose my armpits, i don't know. maybe i was being funny.  maybe i was a little ripe.  i don't recall.

we slap hands.  thanks for the joint.  stop by the giant map again on the way out.  i have a plan.  going to be the best dmv trip ever.

in the car, down the road. heavenly orange scent. and then traffic.  i am stuck in traffic when i start to notice my pits are maybe not feeling great.  maybe warm and getting warmer.  oh, fuckgod no.  starting to burn now.  goddamn traffic.  i'm white-knuckling it by the time i can get turned around and headed in the direction of the house.  this jaw-clenching, white-knuckle, excruciating drive home.  every minute felt like an hour.  got home ran through a living room full of people and into the shower, alternating armpits under the cold stream for probably and hour.  my armpit skin was a mess of blisters and horror.  chemical burns.  there's no good place to get chemical burns, but i promise you the armpits is probably in the top 2 or 3 places you don't want to ever get chemical burns.  as i recall, it took a solid 2 weeks to go away completely.

    Here is the summary: The author lost all their identifying papers and had to go to the DMV, but before they left, they sprayed their armpits with an orange scent from a pizza place manager's aerosol can, thinking it would conceal the smell of a joint they had smoked in the office

    Here is the article: sorry this is quite a long one...  

obligatory this happened thanksgiving day.

also a little information for the story i am male and both my brother and father are runners. i also have asthma which is cold weather and exercise induced and it was a bit chilly outside that day.

a few weeks ago, my brother suggested that we should get my dad to run a 5k together. we all agreed to get in shape to do a turkey trot on thanksgiving day.

of course to run in the race, i realized that i needed to work out and get in shape a bit. i would say that i am in decent shape even though i don't exercise. i ran a few days in a row and actually ran a full 5k without stopping. i was really proud of myself. 

i was ready to run the race but unfortunately the race day was over 2 weeks away. i decided it would be ok to run every other day just to stay in shape. soon enough i stopped training. i already ran a 5k and didn't die. how hard could it be to do it from scratch?

enter my first fuck up. i trained too little and thought i could just make it just by sheer will. boy was i wrong. when thanksgiving arrived, i was tempted to just sleep in and say i would do another 5k with my family but then i somehow convinced myself to get up and get dressed for the race.

enter my second fuck up. the race my brother had signed us up for was about 30 minutes away from home so i decided to bring a little snack for the ride. while munching on cranberries and biscuts i remembered that my high school gym teacher said i should drink water before i ran a race. i then proceeded to down 3 entire water bottles.

we arrived at the place where the 5k was being held and we signed in and walked on over to the starting line. while my brother ran around a bit, my dad and i both were stretching to get ready. as we lined up i did get a bit nervous because i hadn't run a full 5k for 2 weeks but i quickly shook that feeling off.

right after we start, i start to hit my stride. i passed a few people, a few people passed me. then i notice me and another girl were keeping pace. we passed each other a few times and then i ran a bit ahead of her. then at about the 3k marker, i noticed my shoe was untied. i stopped and tied it and got back into my stride. i noticed the girl was now hot on my tail since i had stopped for quite a bit. i stayed ahead of her until the last 200 feet or so. she started to pull ahead and i had thought i had lost my "race" with her.

there were quite a few people near the finish line telling people to "keep going" and "you can do this!" i knew i could finish and i really wanted to beat this girl. in the last 100 feet i know this guy can see i'm struggling and i look over at him and he says ["c'mon you can do it!"](https://i.memecaptain.com/gend_images/9ehzrg.gif)

enter my third and final fuck up. encouraged by this random stranger's words i decided to say fuck it. i'd be damned if she beat me in this race. i sprinted that last 100 feet in the fastest time i did even compared to when i was in football. i blew past her in the last 25 feet and won the race. as i was slowing down i was going to go over there with a cheesy pick up live of "hey i got 24:10. what's your number?" unfortunately i didn't make it far before i puked my guts out. this includes the liquidy cranberries and water mixture. i immediately had 10 people come up to me telling me to stay calm while they got an ambulance. my brother quickly ran over to my side explaining the situation to the people calling the ambulance.

and the worst thing about all this is i didn't even get her number.

tl;dr puked up cranberries after sprinting the last 100 feet of a 5k, people thought i was puking blood, almost got a ambulance ride!

    Here is the summary: During a 5k race on Thanksgiving Day, I made three crucial mistakes that led to me puking up cranberries and almost getting an ambulance ride

enter my third and final fuck up. encouraged by this random stranger's words i decided to say fuck it. i'd be damned if she beat me in this race. i sprinted that last 100 feet in the fastest time i did even compared to when i was in football. i blew past her in the last 25 feet and won the race. as i was slowing down i was going to go over there with a cheesy pick up live of "hey i got 24:10. what's your number?" unfortunately i didn't make it far before i puked my guts out. this includes the liquidy cranberries and water mixture. i immediately had 10 people come up to me telling me to stay calm while they got an ambulance. my brother quickly ran over to my side explaining the situation to the people calling the ambulance.

and the worst thing about all this is i didn't even get her number.

tl;dr puked up cranberries after sprinting the last 100 feet of a 5k, people thought i was puking blood, almost got a ambulance ride!

    Here is the summary: I trained too little for a 5K race and thought I could just wing it, but I ended up puking up cranberries during the last 100 feet of the race
    


    You will be given one summary written for a news article. Your task is to rate the summary based on the following criteria:
    Output format: PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE

    Evaluation Criteria:
    1. Read the news article carefully and identify the main topic and key points.
    2. Read the summary and compare it to the news article. Check if the summary covers the main topic and key points of the news article, and if it resents them in a clear and logical order.
    3. Rate the summary with 5 percentages, where each one represents how likely the summary is going to get a score from 1 to 5. For example, if you think the summary is 80% likely to get a score of 5, 10% likely to get a score of 4, 5% likely to get a score of 3, 3% likely to get a score of 2, and 1% likely to get a score of 1, you should rate the summary as 80, 10, 5, 3, 2.

    Here is the article: this happened a little bit ago but here goes. 

i finally convinced a friend of mine who's been single forever to try out a popular online dating site okaycupid.  he makes a profile, posts pictures, fills out some starter questions, and then waits.  nothing happens for about a week.  so my tifu came when one night i told him i'd log on for him and message a girl or two to get him started. i get a little drunk to shake up the creative juices, find a girl i think he'd like, and proceed to write her a message.  in the message i link her a funny vid from the ytmnd ( you're the man now dog) website and do the standard "hi i think we have stuff in common" message.  thinking my job well and done i head to bed.

i wake up the next day to a text from my buddy asking me what i did last night.  his profile was banned and deleted from the site for violating the user agreement. i fight the hangover haze and proceed to tell him who i messaged and what i wrote.  he then proceeded to laugh for about two minutes straight.  apparently at the time if you linked a ytmnd video to a unknown site or something the ytmnd link would redirect to an old internet classic.  i goatse'd the girl.

 

he never internet dated again.  

the end.

    Here is the summary: I convinced my single friend to try online dating, but my attempt to help him get started ended in disaster when I accidentally goatse'd a girl on the site

    Here is the article: i was asked by some friends to help an elderly man move into a senior apartment near my house.  i was free and thought why not do something nice for someone.  

a group of us were moving boxes and other stuff into the apartment.  at one point we moved some boxes in the kitchen to make room for the microwave and one of the boxes got placed on the stove-top. i bumped the knobs that control the burners accidentally turning on the one underneath one of the boxes and it started to burn the box.  no one even noticed that something was wrong because it was an electric stove-top so  it took a minute to get hot enough to cause the box to start smoking.  luckily another person there saw the smoke and removed the box and shut off the burner.  the whole apartment was filled with smoke and even one of the neighbors came out concerned the building was on fire. 

 no one realized that it was my fault and since there was no damage reddit is the only place that needs to know.

    Here is the article: this just happened to me a few minutes ago. for a little bit of background, i work in tech support, and mostly support bank employees. sometimes we get bank customers who call in when they have issues with their cards or checks. when this happens we have to transfer them to the correct number. so here is the fu, i advise the caller that she is calling bank employee support, and that i can transfer her to a check services number, she agrees so i start typing in the phone number. i hit dial and without thinking and before listing for the automated voice that says "thank you for calling check services" i transfer her on and just as i am about to hang up, i realize my fu, i hit an 8 instead of a 7 for the last digit of the number. so what i actually called was a sex line...in a panic i quickly hung up the phone. now normally if i transfer a caller to the wrong number, i ask for their number, call them back and get them to the right place, but since this was a sex line, i freaked out as i am on a recorded line (i know even worse right?). i was hoping that she didn't call our support desk again and would just call her bank as she should have done. several minutes later, i get an im from one of our offshore folks (half of my team is in the philippines) he states that he has a women on the phone who says she just spoke with me. here is how that went.

>**offshore:** i think you gave her the wrong number


>**me:** *(acting as if i didn't know already)* oh really? where did she end up? 


>**offshore:** a sex line


>**me:** omg no! wut? (see how i know nothing! lol)


>**offshore:** yeah don't worry i apologized on your behalf.

so as you can see i played it off pretty cool, like i didn't know the fu happened. i advised him that the phone number was one digit off from our support line. he said she ended up getting a laugh out of it once it was explained, and wasn't angry. i felt really bad though, especially because in a panic i hung up, i was also worried that she would complain and say employees are sending customers to sex lines. i just hope nobody listens to the recording of that call.

    Here is the article: this happened in december, but i only found out about my blunder today.

so, i decided to change my google+ name to my league of legends username. i have a couple videos on youtube and i thought that it'd make more sense to use my league ign instead of my real name as my channel. little did i know that this would also change my name on gmail...

come christmas/new years, i email my employers and former professors, wishing them a happy holidays and whatnot. i do this every year, and i always receive replies back. however, this year, i did not get a single reply. i thought it was strange, but decided to wait a week. maybe everyone was on vacation and did not have time to get back to me.

today, i got paranoid (thinking that maybe i had accidentally sent something inappropriate), and decided to go check my "sent" inbox...


lo and behold... i'm greeted with my own fucking league of legends username as the sender. for all the emails i've sent since december! i had been corresponding with the name "redeemer hexapod", no one bothered to tell me, and i was too dumb to notice it myself.  

i have no idea what to do now. should i send another e-mail? or just pretend it never happened? this is incredibly embarrassing.

    Here is the article: like the title says. this isn't a horrible one but more of a funny one. i am an idiot regardless though.

i work at a church as a videographer/media producer type thing and i need a shot of a candle on a black backdrop. 

i head upstairs and grab a candle, it is a simple white one. i also grab a lighter, and then head back to the studio downstairs to start shooting.

i start trying to light the candle, and it doesn't smell good and it's starting to spark, i just assume this is one dumb-ass candle and it will light eventually. 

after a couple minutes of failure, my coworker comes into the room and asks what's that smell. i tell him it's this candle that isn't lighting, he comes and grabs the candle from me and looks at the bottom and just starts laughing. only then does it hit me that it was a fake candle and not a real one. 

i get a photo taken of me and the candle and now it is the church staff joke being passed around the office.

    Here is the article: so college just started and everyone's asking everyone else about buying/selling textbooks. i had a bunch left over from my first year so i decided to try and sell them. there is a store partnered with my college that sells textbooks, so i looked at their used book prices, undercut them somewhat, post a listing on the college facebook and waited.

within a few minutes i get...a bunch of people laughing.

turns out that one of the textbooks i had listed for $95 has a going rate of more like $30. now everyone thinks i'm a dirty scammer trying to gouge the pockets of my peers and i've pretty much dropped all chances of making any new friends this semester.

not to mention, i have no idea if any of the other books are overpriced in this manner, so i'll probably wake up tomorrow for more people laughing to another hilariously over priced textbook.

just...screw the textbook industry.

    Here is the summary: The author tried to sell their used textbooks from their first year of college on the college's Facebook page, but their prices were significantly higher than the going rate, leading to accusations of scamming and making it unlikely to make new friends this semester

    Here is the article: obligatory: did not happen today, but 13 years ago, but it also ties in to recent events.

i lived with two roommates in a 3 bedroom apartment during college; we’ll call them ned and ethan. the three of us became great friends and partook in standard college debauchery, to include pranks. the most common recurring prank was laying-in-wait somewhere in the apartment with an acoustic guitar, ready to bust out adam sandler’s at a medium pace (google it) at the most unexpected time. (everyone thinks they’re hilarious in college, i know).
the most common locations for this were the living room closet, under the kitchen table, or some other common area of the apartment. but one night, my dumbass-self decided to kick it up a notch, hide in ned’s bedroom closet, wait until he was just about to fall asleep, and then hit him with the crass sounds of adam sandler on my shitty washburn 6-string. 

trying this sort of shenanigan on a random college student would be suicide, but ned was no random college student. ned was the 6’3” milquetoast soft-hearted teddy bear that all the ladies loved, but none of them would date. ned would drive 3 hours home every weekend and bring back a casserole that his parents still cooked for him. ned never talked bad about anyone behind their back, always tried to pick up the tab at the bar, and would be sure that everyone had a sober ride home. in short, ned was the kid that every quixotic parent wishes their angel would be when they send them off to college. so to me, that meant that whenever ned shut his door at night, he changed into a neatly pressed set of pajamas, humbly consumed an 8oz glass of tap water, and retired to bed.

so i grabbed my guitar, turned off my bedroom light, shut my door (so that he’d think i had went to bed early), and snuck into ned’s bedroom to position myself in his closet. it was a reach-in closet with the accordion doors that had the horizontal slats at a 45 degree pitch, [like this](https://cdn.instructables.com/fya/uc2h/hmvja37y/fyauc2hhmvja37y.medium.jpg). ned’s bed was on opposite side of the room from the closet, so i’d have an adequate acoustic buffer beween myself and ned, in case i accidently shifted my weight and made a subtle noise. but directly next to the closet (literally one foot of distance from myself) was ned’s computer and desk. 
ned came into his room for the evening, shut his door, turned off the light, and sat directly down at his computer. due to the 45 degree angle of the closet slats, i could see the computer monitor on his desk perfectly from my head level, down to the desk level. the 12 inch proximity of ned spiked my adrenaline, and i began to control my breathing. my back was pressed against coat hangers, and i had to diligently muffle an acoustic guitar to avoid giving away my position. ned loaded up his email for some nightly reading, and i had convinced myself that everything was now just a waiting game. ([artist depiction](https://i.imgur.com/xmlm5bh.png))

as ned closed his email though, my gleeful, mischievous anticipation promptly transitioned. ned did not reach for his glass of water. ned did not opt for the pajamas. ned did not leave his desk. ned reached for a box of tissues, navigated his browser to a site that specialized in anal sex of large black women, and dropped trou.

a million regretful thoughts immediately went through my panicked brain, but it was too late. if i make myself known now, he’d be immensely embarrassed and angry that i had just violated his privacy. but if i *didn’t* speak up now, chances are i’d have to reveal myself after he was done doing the deed at some point, which means he would have rubbed one out while his roommate had a line of sight 12 inches away. so i was just stuck there, frozen, trying to remain motionless and silent, while ned flogged the dolphin mere inches away. it felt like i was breathing down his neck while he was stroking it.

my hands began to cramp as i awkwardly held the guitar in a way that wouldn’t generate an ounce of noise. my legs began to jitter as i compensated for the awkward position of my back against coat hangers. seconds turned into minutes and minutes felt like hours as i waited for him to finish, not knowing how the hell i was going to make it out of his room without him noticing.

after ned’s satisfactory groan of pleasure in tandem with a rhythmic plop-plop-plop-plop onto a kleenex, it felt like my guilt had transitioned from a misdemeanor to a felony, and my knees were jittering so hard that i had already started rehearsing an apology in my head for when he inevitably heard a noise from his closet.

ned promptly got into bed on the opposite side of the room, and i had started to evaluate my decision in life, and the real possibility of spending the entire damned night inside of his closet. all critical thinking had revealed zero other courses of action, until i remembered my cell phone was in my pocket. but with two hands stifling an acoustic guitar and zero room to maneuver, how would i get the phone out my pocket? somehow i did, and i texted ethan in the next room over:

> foogama: in ned’s closet. was trying to do medium pace gag. ned started wanking before i could start. now i’m stuck in the closet and can’t get out. need help.
> 
> ethan: lol right.
> 
> foogama: ethan, i’m dead serious. i need you to help create a distraction for ned so that i can gtfo of this closet and back into my room without him noticing.
> 
> ethan: …we’re going to need to have a talk later.

right around then our landline phone rang (yeah, they were still on the tail end of existing in 2005). it was 10:45pm on a thursday, but i could hear ethan answering it loudly and obviously: **“hello? why yes ned is here. is everything okay? ned! ned come here, phone for you!”** ned rolled over in bed, and immediately took the bait. how this never raised suspicion, i’ll never know. it was a cordless phone. there was no need for ned to walk all the way out of his room to the kitchen. but thank god he did. i bolted out of that closet and retreated back to my room and ned was none the wiser, as he went to take a phone call that some "stranger" had conveniently disconnected right as he got there.

i was forever in debt to ethan for saving my ass, and we never told ned. that is, of course until last weekend, 13 years later, when we were both in ned’s wedding. there was a fun pre-wedding bachelor activity with the groomsmen where we all had to list something we “found interesting” about ned and put it into a hat for a groomsmen to pick out of a hat. 4-beers in, i was convinced by ethan to write “that he enjoys anal sex with large black women” because it would make a fun “bachelor story” over 10 years after the fact.

but of course that’s not what happened. the best man decided it would be more fun to—without warning—switch things up, and swap hats with the maid of honor, so that we’d be reading the bride’s, and they’d be reading ned’s. and of course, there was a larger black woman as a bridesmaid on the other side of the aisle who just happened to fucking draw that out of the damn hat. i didn’t even know her name. i had actually never even met the bride until the wedding weekend.

the bridesmaid read it aloud, mortified, and tried to brush it off as an intentional joke, targeted at her in poor taste. ned, however, looked like everyone in the room had just seen him naked. he immediately pulled all of his groomsmen aside, and asked us who had put that into the hat. i immediately confessed, and explained the story from 2005. ethan and i waited for ned to chuckle, smirk, or brush it off as a ridiculous moment in history, but apparently it was still too soon. we were both relieved of our ceremonial bible verse reading duties that day and had to go apologize to his bride and the bridesmaid.

 

i've since learned my lesson and just don't hide in peoples' bedrooms like an idiot.

edit: thank you all for the gold, comments, and concerns for ned. ned is a really great guy and i'm sure we'll be fine.

edit 2: i got "ethan" to create a reddit account and entertain questions. you can [find his comment here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/7y6bqu/tifu_by_revealing_that_i_had_secretly_hid_in_my/duf2fq4/).

 currently covered in blood. as if this was not all i'm in a skype chat with my friends talking about how we're going to learn to be masters at baiting fish or how we put it: *masterbaitin'*. lo and behold the one person out of my family that hears me is my brother. he immediately barges into my room and asks me with a disgruntled look on his face, " god damn op, wasn't one time enough today?" i'm so glad i'm going to not be at home the next 3 days.

 currently covered in blood. as if this was not all i'm in a skype chat with my friends talking about how we're going to learn to be masters at baiting fish or how we put it: *masterbaitin'*. lo and behold the one person out of my family that hears me is my brother. he immediately barges into my room and asks me with a disgruntled look on his face, " god damn op, wasn't one time enough today?" i'm so glad i'm going to not be at home the next 3 days.

    Here is the article: fridays at work we have a tradition to bring a couple of bottles of booze and we start doing shots around 5 pm (1 hour before we leave to go home). our team likes to mildly fuck with each other by misplacing items, zip-tying thing to other things, hiding each others chairs, using large amounts of tape to attach things to the work table. basically pranks of mild inconvenience with comedic twist. the mark for my latest prank is usually the one who pulls off the most elaborate pranks.

so last friday the mark leaves early, plus he doesn't drink. so i get this genius idea to use a whole roll of magic tape to tape his mouse to his mouse pad. the team is standing around taking shots of tequila and drinking whiskey. all goes well. then i get a sudden urge to tape something the mark uses all the time - his qc15 bose headphones. i get another roll of magic tape and proceed to tape both of the cups together in a tight clam-like form. making sure the cord is not taped, to make it look authentic. two rolls of tape later, i feel accomplished. i take couple more shots of tequila, then leave to go home.

monday rolls around. as i walk to work, i keep thinking that i should have taped each cup of the headphones off on the inside. so when the mark puts on the headphones, he'll feel the tape.
eventually the mark comes to work, and gives me the "you fucker" look. i see him struggle with the headphones. it makes me wonder why, so i approach him to see that he's trying to peel the tape off slowly as it's pulling on the delicate cushions and ripping them apart. $300+ headphones being ruined with every gentle pull. i see that the mark isn't happy with his new, disgruntled looking, bose noise cancelling headphones. i feel bad enough to tell him that i'll have to get him a new pair. he says that he might have some extra cushions at home. i still feel bad. so i take a quick break and walk over to a nearby bose store to get a pair of extra cushions. i tell the clerk my stupid story. the clerk laughs and tells me "well, your little prank is going to cost you $50."

    Here is the article: this happened yesterday. some background: my 2 year old has had the stomach flu for 2 days. she was getting dehydrated and we were having to keep a close eye on her urination to make sure she didn't need to go to the er. 

she was laying on the couch bouncing between napping and watching cartoons for about 2 hours. she woke up and cried out, "peeing now!" i didn't want to have to clean the couch again (i had already done that once from it being puked on) so i picked her up and put my hand under her to keep pee from dripping while i ran her to the bathroom. i got her to the bathroom and found what she said was pee was actually terrible diarrhea. it was all over her, all over me, all over the couch and the blankets. my sacrifice was for nothing. i still had to clean the couch again. she's been in a pull-up since then.

    Here is the article: yesterday i was doing a makesafe for a whole floor demolition. the usual routine is that we trace and kill circuits only for spaces being demolished, but we turn off all breakers (except lighting) to a floor that is fully being demolished. i stumbled across a dark room with subpanels and started flipping them off one by one. since there was nothing else to do, i left to another job.

a few hours later, gc calls up my foreman stating a complaint about a tenant's server room eventually going offline. i brushed that off since it shouldn't have done any harm since it shut down with grace. but today, i learned a hell of a lot more. i had turned off power to 10 floors of a financial tenant containing banking, document management, and card key locks to client data, meaning that anyone could come up to their floor and steal shit, and also halting transactions. i fucked up big time. hopefully i can stay hidden from these guys for a good while.

    Here is the article: so this happened about a week ago. for a bit of context, i'm (24f) currently between jobs so i'm doing most of the housework while my husband (27m) is working through the day. on this particular day i was tackling the laundry. 

i have a costco membership, so to save money we tend to get the big containers of detergent and siphon it out into a smaller container for everyday use since the large ones like to get air pockets and shoot out detergent at random intervals nowhere near where i attempt to pour it. 

i was fixing to start my second load of laundry when i realised the smaller container was close to empty. we have a funnel we use to help transfer the detergent easily but today i couldn't find it anywhere. it's tricky to do without making a mess due to the size of the opening on the container, but i am too stubborn for my own good. i figured if i used my hand to cup over one side of the opening i will divert most of the potential mess. (it's a gentle detergent so no harm there). so i open a brand new costco sized container and get to pouring. 

this works surprisingly well until the hand pouring the detergent slips, causing the larger container to knock the smaller one over. small spill, no big deal but enough to need a decent clean up. i use a nearby rag to wipe most of it up, unwittingly knocking a bit onto the linoleum floor. 

deciding i had messed up. i decided to just try to use the large one for the day. so i pick it back up and take a step towards my washer when my foot catches on the stray detergent and i'm down like a cartoon villain on a banana peel. 

the next bit is a blur but i apparently let go of the detergent in an attempt to catch myself. it lands on the floor next to me and cracks open pretty badly in one corner, quickly covering a decent part of the floor in detergent. i panic and try to get up quickly to find some way to salvage whatever was left of this mess. clinging onto the dryer at this point to lift myself up wasn't enough as i lose all of my footing again and fall in the opposite direction, completely crushing the container. detergent is everywhere by this point. 

rather than panic again, i sit up and take a minute to really absorb what just happened and i start laughing, was this really happening? that kind of laughing where you just can't seem to stop because of how ridiculous the whole situation is. 

a bit of context here. my husband works within walking distance of home and often pops in for lunch. this was one of those days, and he has the best/worst timing depending on what point of view you have. also, when i'm home i tend to not wear clothing because, well, why would i? 

so it is during this spell of borderline insane cackling when the front door (which is almost directly across from the laundry room) opens, and the first thing he sees is his wife sitting naked in the floor, almost completely coated in laundry detergent, laughing like a homicidal maniac. 

overall it could've been far worse, but i don't think he's ever gonna let me live this one down.

    Here is the summary: While attempting to do laundry, the author slipped and fell multiple times, causing a large spill of laundry detergent and resulting in her being covered in the substance and laughing uncontrollably

    Here is the article: now like all great fuck ups this happened quite a few years ago. in my senior year of highschool actually. this is also my first submission, so to add a bit of it i went to pinetree secondary in bc. now will i regret that decision? probably.

a bit of backstory though. when i was in grade 11 i had the bright idea of taking physics while being hilariously terrible at math thinking 'this may help me in the future for stuff or something' and within the first week i was actually failing. so i asked to switch out and go into fitness 12 instead, thus saving me from a change in grad portfolio that made my other friends annoyed cause it meant i didn't have to do anything.

i did, however, need to take a science 11 course because i dropped out of physics. so i decided to take earth sciences, also known as what was possibly the easiest science. now, there was a teacher there who a vast majority of the student body hated. not because she was mean or her classes were hard or anything like that. but because she was fucking terrible at her job. like actually the worst teacher i've ever met, more about that later. she was also one of the two earth sciences teachers at my school, and lo and behold i got her for earth sciences. so from this point on i will call this teacher chugs.

chugs was, at the time, a mid-40s overweight russian woman. her idea of being health was having 10 diet cokes and a salad. now my first class with her set the bar so low for the year as the first thing she bragged about was having a masters from a super prestigious university in college for...physics. someone brought up why isn't she teaching physics and she responded with the position was filled. each class after was a more ridiculous lie after the other.   
"i have a prosthetic leg." the day after she wore a skirt showing off her disgusting hairy ass legs.

"i was married by a millionaire" except, you know, same reason as the physics thing. and more and more.  

now onto her classes. chug's classes were the worst fucking classes in existence. she explained shit horrifically, would refuse any answer that wasn't her own including that from the book, and here were how her hour long classes went. she explained something for 10 minutes, drew a shitty james bond picture in a submarine, and said 'self study time and homework' and sat there with her fucking 10 diet cokes.

now onto a bit of my student life. i wasn't the best student in terms of studying and homework completion like that. my grades were c- to c+ usually in academic stuff, and it didn't help that i was horrible at test taking(still am) but i was generally liked by my teachers because i was just all around pleasant to have in their classes. i'd smile, be quiet, and listen. also be generally a nice person in general.

now here comes the fuckup. one day during one of her shitty classes she makes a mistake. a really, really, really bad one. now i don't remember what it was because of how long ago it was, but i remember my classmates looking at each other wondering if they should correct her. i ignore them and decide to do so.

what followed was her giving me the meanest fucking deathglare you'd ever see and say i'm wrong. i say that it's written in the book, she says prove it, and i read out the line word for word, which during you heard chuckling from other students. chugs asks to see me after class and i just go okay.

when class ended, chugs kept me behind and closed the door. she looked at me and started yelling at my face saying how i'm wrong and how i'm undermining her authority or stuff like that and i'm not saying anything letting her get all her rage out before i say anything. i then realize it's time for my next class and i go 'chugs, can we continue this at lunch or after school because i'll be late for my next class.'  

sure go was chug's response followed by 'i don't need to see you anytime today.'. a bit ominous i thought, but she can't really do anything to me that'll hurt me mentally or physically. i was wrong. very wrong.

fast forward to lunch and i'm chilling with my friends eating lunch and stuff when my phone starts ringing. 'odd.' i say as i check who's phoning. it's my dad, and i'm wondering why he's phoning at work when he refuses to pick up ever during any time of the day. so i pick up and go 'hello, hello.' in my usual tone of being cheerful when i'm immediately greeted by yelling loud enough that other people can hear. so i go into the costume room(acting student) and close the door and i ask what's wrong.

he then tell me that chugs got my mom's phone number, phoned her, and was telling my mom what a horrible student i was and how i was yelling at her and treating her like shit. now this comes to a shock for me in so many reasons. one, the only time i got in trouble with teachers was in grade 6 where i made a teacher cry because i kept skipping detentions. i cried too because i felt super bad, manned up, and took the detentions which actually helped me be better at school.  

two, if anyone ever knew me for more then a day they'd tell you i'm the nicest guy they've ever met. am i? who knows. but they all say how i'm the nicest guy, always cheerful, etc. etc.

three, that my parents believed chugs right away without getting my side of the story. at this point i got so pissed off that instead of hanging up i threw my phone so hard on the ground that it hanged up by breaking in two. i put it back together because nokia flip-phone when there was an announcement for me to go to the councilors office. my friends, and acting classmates looked surprised and asked if everything was alright and i responded maybe.

i go to the councilor's office to see my mom crying and sobbing and my councilor giving the most disappointed look to me while consoling my mom. what happened was chugs came to the councilor telling her 'what happened' after class and demanded my mom's phone number. and then my mom said she was disappointed in me, why i would ever do this let alone how, etc. etc. and how my brother wouldn't do this and that i need to apologize.  

i try to defend myself by explaining what happened, but no one believed me. i asked the councilor to call the other students to get their testimony to show i was telling the truth but she refused saying i needed to apologize. now i got livid and pissed off and actually said "it'll be a cold fucking day in hell before i apologize to that fucking bitch." in which case i immediately regretted what i said. now what happened afterwards i don't remember, but i remember chugs coming in, asking for an apology in which i was forced too and then my mom left for home still partially crying and stuff. i left the office and saw chugs behind me smirking a tiny bit. at this point i was so angry i would've run at her and beat her senseless, but i didn't. instead i seethed. i seethed so much that the only people that know how pissed i was were my friends that were with me that day. i went back to the costume room, my friends followed, and i broke down crying as i tried telling them the situation.  

for the rest of the year, this was at the half-way point by the way, i was seething every time i was in her class. the second i saw her, my day was immediately ruined. at home i was passive aggressive towards all my family members because not a single one of them believed me. not my dad, mom, or even my brother.

it wasn't until i graduated until one person believed me, and that was my brother who came with me to the school after chugs phoned my mom saying that i wrote something demeaning to her in the yearbook. my mom demanded to know what i wrote and i showed her quote thing that grads write down for graduating which was something from a game that i really liked. so she asked my brother to go with me, and at this point i was already seething, all ready to get throw a fucking table at her face and when we go there we not only find out it's not a fucking yearbook, but a textbook. and not even the one i used(we had to put out names in the front) and she showed us a whited out spot in which i was so dumbfounded at how fucking dumb this person could be and said no it wasn't me. she then did a 180 and go 'oh okay! that's good! have a good day!'  

outside the door my brother asked me if she was always like this in which i responded in an extremely pissed tone 'yes'. he then apologized.

    Here is the summary: The author had a negative experience with a teacher named Chugs in their high school Earth Sciences class, which led to a series of misunderstandings and conflicts that affected the author's relationships with their family and friends

    Here is the article: now like all great fuck ups this happened quite a few years ago. in my senior year of highschool actually. this is also my first submission, so to add a bit of it i went to pinetree secondary in bc. now will i regret that decision? probably.

a bit of backstory though. when i was in grade 11 i had the bright idea of taking physics while being hilariously terrible at math thinking 'this may help me in the future for stuff or something' and within the first week i was actually failing. so i asked to switch out and go into fitness 12 instead, thus saving me from a change in grad portfolio that made my other friends annoyed cause it meant i didn't have to do anything.

i did, however, need to take a science 11 course because i dropped out of physics. so i decided to take earth sciences, also known as what was possibly the easiest science. now, there was a teacher there who a vast majority of the student body hated. not because she was mean or her classes were hard or anything like that. but because she was fucking terrible at her job. like actually the worst teacher i've ever met, more about that later. she was also one of the two earth sciences teachers at my school, and lo and behold i got her for earth sciences. so from this point on i will call this teacher chugs.

chugs was, at the time, a mid-40s overweight russian woman. her idea of being health was having 10 diet cokes and a salad. now my first class with her set the bar so low for the year as the first thing she bragged about was having a masters from a super prestigious university in college for...physics. someone brought up why isn't she teaching physics and she responded with the position was filled. each class after was a more ridiculous lie after the other.   
"i have a prosthetic leg." the day after she wore a skirt showing off her disgusting hairy ass legs.

"i was married by a millionaire" except, you know, same reason as the physics thing. and more and more.  

now onto her classes. chug's classes were the worst fucking classes in existence. she explained shit horrifically, would refuse any answer that wasn't her own including that from the book, and here were how her hour long classes went. she explained something for 10 minutes, drew a shitty james bond picture in a submarine, and said 'self study time and homework' and sat there with her fucking 10 diet cokes.

now onto a bit of my student life. i wasn't the best student in terms of studying and homework completion like that. my grades were c- to c+ usually in academic stuff, and it didn't help that i was horrible at test taking(still am) but i was generally liked by my teachers because i was just all around pleasant to have in their classes. i'd smile, be quiet, and listen. also be generally a nice person in general.

now here comes the fuckup. one day during one of her shitty classes she makes a mistake. a really, really, really bad one. now i don't remember what it was because of how long ago it was, but i remember my classmates looking at each other wondering if they should correct her. i ignore them and decide to do so.

what followed was her giving me the meanest fucking deathglare you'd ever see and say i'm wrong. i say that it's written in the book, she says prove it, and i read out the line word for word, which during you heard chuckling from other students. chugs asks to see me after class and i just go okay.

when class ended, chugs kept me behind and closed the door. she looked at me and started yelling at my face saying how i'm wrong and how i'm undermining her authority or stuff like that and i'm not saying anything letting her get all her rage out before i say anything. i then realize it's time for my next class and i go 'chugs, can we continue this at lunch or after school because i'll be late for my next class.'  

sure go was chug's response followed by 'i don't need to see you anytime today.'. a bit ominous i thought, but she can't really do anything to me that'll hurt me mentally or physically. i was wrong. very wrong.

fast forward to lunch and i'm chilling with my friends eating lunch and stuff when my phone starts ringing. 'odd.' i say as i check who's phoning. it's my dad, and i'm wondering why he's phoning at work when he refuses to pick up ever during any time of the day. so i pick up and go 'hello, hello.' in my usual tone of being cheerful when i'm immediately greeted by yelling loud enough that other people can hear. so i go into the costume room(acting student) and close the door and i ask what's wrong.

he then tell me that chugs got my mom's phone number, phoned her, and was telling my mom what a horrible student i was and how i was yelling at her and treating her like shit. now this comes to a shock for me in so many reasons. one, the only time i got in trouble with teachers was in grade 6 where i made a teacher cry because i kept skipping detentions. i cried too because i felt super bad, manned up, and took the detentions which actually helped me be better at school.  

two, if anyone ever knew me for more then a day they'd tell you i'm the nicest guy they've ever met. am i? who knows. but they all say how i'm the nicest guy, always cheerful, etc. etc.

three, that my parents believed chugs right away without getting my side of the story. at this point i got so pissed off that instead of hanging up i threw my phone so hard on the ground that it hanged up by breaking in two. i put it back together because nokia flip-phone when there was an announcement for me to go to the councilors office. my friends, and acting classmates looked surprised and asked if everything was alright and i responded maybe.

i go to the councilor's office to see my mom crying and sobbing and my councilor giving the most disappointed look to me while consoling my mom. what happened was chugs came to the councilor telling her 'what happened' after class and demanded my mom's phone number. and then my mom said she was disappointed in me, why i would ever do this let alone how, etc. etc. and how my brother wouldn't do this and that i need to apologize.

    Here is the article: first off, for those who don't know what usenet is or what it's used for, check out the binary newsgroups section here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/usenet_newsgroup#binary_newsgroups ( 

anyways, around 2007 (i think) i got a decent deal on usenet/newsgroup service via a secret referral link which now seems to be an unpublished deal (http://www.news.astraweb.com/specials/96-yearly.html). deal is you get the promo price of $96usd for a year's worth of service if you continue to keep your account active via an auto renewal. at that time, this was an amazing price for the long retention periods so i signed up and practically set-it-and-forget-it.

lately i've noticed a decline in retention quality on older binary posts with astraweb. specifically, some posts older than 1000 days (+/- 100 days) are missing articles and they're essentially incomplete. since the service seems to be on a decline and the renewal was coming up next month, i decided to cancel and jump to newshosting for an extra $3 with the same retention periods. i logged into my account to check out the exact date of the last bill but it only went up to july 2010. i didn't think anything of it since the interface looks like it was designed by a college student in the late 90s and thought they probably had some error.

i send them off an email to cancel and get this response back http://i.imgur.com/ad42wf0.png

turns out they haven't charged me since last year and would have continued on to eternity if i just kept my pie hole shut. just for shits and giggles to satisfy my curiosity, i went through my old credit card statements and it looks like i haven't been charged at all since 2010! the damn billing page wasn't lying!

    Here is the article: sooo this just happened.
been going out with this girl for about 2 years now. we're pretty much living together now, but she occasionally complains that i never take her out on a "date" date (i have no idea what this means). 
now up to this point, whenever i do make plans to take my girl out on a proper all out date, one of us either catches a cold, the weather turns to shit, or some other emergency (act of god/sabotage) occurs. she pouts but doesn't really make too big of a deal about it. 
so this weekend, its sakura blooming season in here tokyo, and i want to make up for the failed dates. i plan a picnic under the sakura trees at a really nice park far from the city. and to prepare, i get my hair cut, take out the blazer from its hiding place, and generally look as dapper as i can be. i went out to buy some nice wine and while walking down the aisle, i see this nose hair waxing kit. now, blame it on the years of being surrounded by hairless japanese guys (im pretty hairy) or my crumbling sense of masculinity in this society, but in my "im da boss" moment i think why the fuck not, and toss that kit along with the wine into the cart with gusto.  
fast forward to this morning. 
the inside of my nose is now hairless like a babies bottom, and my sinuses are either so overjoyed or so confused its turned the inside of my nose it into a frickin water slide of mucous and regret, and on top of that i seem to have now caught a raging cold. at work, (where i am typing this right now) i am blaming the mound of tissues on allergies, but if it doesn't get better by tmrw, i will have to cancel again and inform my ever patient girlfriend that this time its because i fucking stuck wax up my nose.

    Here is the article: happened july, still cringing about it. 

went to  play paintball for the first time with 6 colleagues, we got strangers mixed into our team. we ended up being about 15 people, meaning half the team unfamiliar faces. second mission was congo village, so capturing the houses in the middle, each team starting at one side. i sprinted to the closest house and stayed a little hidden, with sight onto another house quite a bit further to the middle with people huddling inside. "perfect line of sight", i thought and proceeded to shoot directly at one of them, full hit at least three times. as that person did kind of ignore it i got upset about this apparent cheater and called for the game master to show him out. as you can already imagine, it was at that point i saw the tape of the same colour as mine around his arm while he was walking to the side of the battlefield. i apologized hard in that moment but after that game didn't even know anymore who it was.

    Here is the article: my two fuck ups in one day, surprise surprise, did not happen today but actually sunday. useful information, i'm a dutch girl who recently moved to qatar and last sunday was the first day of eid ul-fitr (a muslim holiday after ramada) and almost everybody gets the day off.


what was supposed to be a beautiful day turned out in an adventure that make people come to me at work asking what happened at the beach. 


i live in a compound and the people i live with asked me to go to the beach which them. because i had nothing better to do i greatly accepted their offer, so i could see something else other than sand as far as the eye reaches for two days straight. 

since i was lazy and and thought i was genius i decided to shave my legs without water, outside of the shower, wondering why nobody came up with that. 

of course there was a reason nobody was advising this great idea. the moment after i shaved my legs they started burning. i ignored it because it must be only temporarily, so i thought. the moment i stepped into the shower (yes i still had to take a shower) it started burning like hell. unfortunately my shower has only the options hot or boiling, with my legs burning i gave up.

quickly got dressed and went to the beach. quick side note, i went with all men to a public beach (nobody wanted to pay for a beach). once we got there, i'm not kidding, it was black of the amount of people who were at the beach as well. when i stepped out of the bus i noticed it were only men, i did not see a single women. 

i'm rarely afraid or startled but this was, let's say an interesting experience. every single man was staring at me (because i'm female and i'm white). i can not describe this feeling but it's kind of the feeling of when you do something embarrassing and everybody looks at you. only then, people realize they don't really care and continue what they were doing, in my case people did care and did not look away.

this was also the moment i went with the option of sweating instead of swimming. i imagined that if i would run to the water and drown myself until my nose, they would wait until i would come back out. 

not short after arriving, and the beach being too crowded, we drove to a smaller beach which was luckily almost empty. i wasn't feeling like swimming anymore so just stood in the sea knee high. this was when my skin started burning like hell. i thought my skin would burn off. so hereby, i would not recommend shaving without water.

    Here is the summary: On Sunday, the first day of Eid ul-Fitr, I had two major mishaps: I shaved my legs without water, causing them to burn, and I went to a public beach with all men, where I felt uncomfortable and self-conscious due to their stares

    Here is the article: so, today i decided to take my girlfriend out to dinner. things seemed like they were going well, the food was good, she was happy. things turned sour when we tried to leave the restaraunt.

now, you see, being a teenager, the u.s. government seems to think that i can't keep track of my own money. i went to a computer parts store today and dropped $90 on a new computer case and some premium fans. well, apparently, i have a $100 spending limit. the u.s. government forgot to tell me that one. 

so, upon leaving the establishment, my card gets declined because it goes over my spending limit. well, that would have been fine if i had bothered to take out money before spending it on a purely cosmetic computer part. 

i had to wait 15 minutes for my mom to come bail me out.

    Here is the article: contrary to many stories here on tifu, this one actually happened today, but it sure is not one of the most entertaining ones. 

i was on my way to the train, for obvious reasons. i had to travel from point a to point b. so here i were, silly me, obliviously boarding the train. the train was almost full, but there were a group of unoccupied seats. i quickly lifted my bag up to the bag compartment, sat down, and the train went off. as i was bringing up my wallet to pay for the train ride, the conductor went past. she looked me in the eyes, and as i was about to point her to me, she waddled away. a feeling of bad conscience creeped up on me, and i went to the guy in the food carriage to ask him if i could pay there, but he said i had to wait in my seat for the conductor to come past again. she did not. so i just sat comfortably seated in what i believe was a more expensive part of the train, until i arrived at my destination. the guy in the little cafeteria on the train asked me when i was leaving the train if i found the conductor, but i did not. the train does not stay for long, so i had to get off fairly quick. as i walked away, afraid of getting fined, he said to my surprise that it probably was not that big of a deal.

    Here is the summary: Despite the train being almost full, I boarded it without paying and sat in an unoccupied seat, feeling a sense of bad conscience as I waited for the conductor to come past and collect my fare

since i rarely do really really dumb things i brush it off and im sure it's somewhere in the car. it's 5:30 am so i just tell the driver to let me know if he finds the backpack to let me know through sms and he even offered to drop it off the next day if he does find it. 

i fall asleep and wake up and come to the realization that my backpack is missing. my laptop, my playstation 4, my nintendo 3ds, my watch my gf gave to me for our 2 year anniversary, my inhaler for my asthma, my nike slippers, and more all gone. i call my friend that dropped me off if i left my backpack there. he responds with a no. i call the ihop incase i left in on the parking lot and their response was also a no. 

finally i messaged the guy who gave us the ride and his response was also a no. now i'm left thinking that i probably left it at the parking lot in the ihop where i got picked up. i'm devastated and now i'm going to start my spring semester without my laptop.

    Here is the article: so today at about 3 a.m. local time i was having a nightmare. i can't recall the specifics, but i was fighting something/someone. i recently moved, so my stuff is still all over my room. in the heat of the moment i kick forward (relative to if i was facing forward, so straight down as i was lying on my stomach) with my right foot, trying to kill that monster/person/scary potato. i am tall, so my legs will dangle over the edge of the bed, and the foot came down *hard* on a box. i wake up to sharp pains in my foot, centered around my big toe. in my groggy half-asleep state, i was understandably confused. i look around and see that i hit my big toe hard on my junior yearbook. i go to the doctor, turns out that i broke my toe (mildly) in two places on a 100ish page book of memories. i'll be on crutches for 3 weeks.

    Here is the article: so today at about 3 a.m. local time i was having a nightmare. i can't recall the specifics, but i was fighting something/someone. i recently moved, so my stuff is still all over my room. in the heat of the moment i kick forward (relative to if i was facing forward, so straight down as i was lying on my stomach) with my right foot, trying to kill that monster/person/scary potato. i am tall, so my legs will dangle over the edge of the bed, and the foot came down *hard* on a box. i wake up to sharp pains in my foot, centered around my big toe. in my groggy half-asleep state, i was understandably confused. i look around and see that i hit my big toe hard on my junior yearbook. i go to the doctor, turns out that i broke my toe (mildly) in two places on a 100ish page book of memories. i'll be on crutches for 3 weeks.

    Here is the summary: In a bizarre turn of events, I broke my big toe while fighting a nightmare and kicking a box in my sleep, resulting in a mild fracture in two places and a 3-week stint on crutches

    Here is the article: this fuck up was approximately two weeks ago. i was in philadelphia visiting colleges with, my mom and my sister, as i was a high school senior. after the long winded presentation/tour at drexel and temple really made me and my family hungry. we went to eat.

finally, we decided that it is time to head back to the big train station in philly and board a train back home. my bladder, however, was about to explode. i excuse myself to go use the bathroom. i ask an employee where the nearest restroom is and he directs me to it. on my approach, i see a kid, around 9 or 10, with a phillies hat run past me with a panicked look on his face. i think practically nothing of it and go to use the bathroom. my urination went normally but as i walk out, i see a lady run toward me. she asks in a hurried breath if i had seen her son. she goes on to describe him to be exactly the kid i had seen. for no reason whatsoever i said calmly "no" and treated her like she was bothering me. right after as she thanked me and sprinted away, i knew i fucked up. i tried to run after her but i had lost her in the crowded train station. i returned to my mom and sister and was empty for the rest of the day.

in hindsight, i don't think me mentioning that i had seen the kid a couple of minutes before would have practically helped the mother find him, but i still can't stand that i said no. i can only hope that they found each other but i have no way of checking. my answer haunts me to this day and sometimes i cannot get it out of my head.

    Here is the summary: The author regrets not telling a mother that he had seen her missing 9-year-old son running past him in a crowded train station, despite knowing that it would not have helped her find him

    Here is the article: obligatory "this actually happened a week ago" as it only just occurred to me that this is something this sub would appreciate. the accident wasn't as bad as some of the others i've seen posted but i thought you guys might get a kick out of my stupidity. 

so i'm making a bolognese from scratch as i've done many many times before without a problem. i use a food processor to grate carrots as i've done many times in the past. it's a cheap processor so what usually happens is after feeding the carrot through the grater a stump at the end of the carrot will not go through and just sit there on top of the blade. 

normally when this happens i'll just turn off the processor, take off the lid, grab the stump and cut it up or throw it out. no biggie. 

on this occasion though, my brain thought "nah i'll just stick my hand through the slot at the top and try to fish it out with my fingers." 

and without thinking i plunged my hand in, forgetting to turn off the processor. 

you can imagine what happens next. 

yes i instantly realised my fuck up. 

yes i am an idiot. 

yes it hurt like a mother fucker. 

luckily being a cheap processor it didn't have the power to do an insane amount of damage, but i did lose a large chunk of nail, some of the flesh underneath and the upper tip of my middle finger.

and from now on i think twice when using any kitchen appliance.

my gf laughed all the way through the aftermath and is never going to let me live this one down.

    Here is the summary: I thoughtlessly stuck my hand into a food processor while it was still running, resulting in the loss of a large chunk of nail, some flesh, and the upper tip of my middle finger

    Here is the article: my pregnant wife was in the living room watering a plant. i recently bought a highly realistic fake tarantula on a whim, because that's the kind of guy i am. (seriously it looks awesome.)

i thought it would be funny to sneak up on my wife and suddenly put the spider on the plant in front of her and yell. she would totally be scared and then laugh and i'd laugh and i'd be a hero. a hero to myself. yes i am a 27 year old man.

but, that is not how it went.

my stealth was successful, and the sudden sight of the spider did freak her out. she shuddered and squealed with fear, and at that same moment...her (actually really nice looking; love ya babe) ass let out a hiss like an angry cobra. 

*sssss*

it took me a moment to register that she had just let out a massive fart. the pregnancy has made her super gassy, so had i thought this through all the way, i could have seen this coming. 

luckily, she did not shit herself, despite this being a story posted to reddit. unluckily, the smell was horrendous, and the moment she recovered from the shock of the sudden spider, she wafted said foul odor at me while laughing. 

the real fuck up seems to be the after-effects. she says that farting is going to be her new "defense mechanism" with me. but she has a very loose definition of "defense." just  before i posted this, she got further revenge for the spider thing (or maybe was just being sadistic) by letting out a sbd on my lap while i was playing dota. i nearly died.

she has realized her power, and will now fully channel her inner-skunk. god damn it. -_-

my wife is awesome though.

    Here is the article: second post here, hopefully this goes better than last time.  typed this up late at night, posted it, found the title innapropriate, tried reposting word-for-word, had to wait a bit.  thus, this happened yesterday.

i am a volunteer counselor at a week-long hellenic camp sponsored by members of my church, where kids learn about greek culture for a week: food, mythology, arts & crafts, the language, etc. i was put in charge of the older group of kids, alongside a few friends of mine. for the most part moderating kids who knew how to handle themselves went by smoothly.

that is, until today. campers attended sports three times a day, and those running the sports station finally decided to go outside in a lull of the st. louis summer heat, and before you know it we had a decent game of soccer going outside. alright, we had a few kids complaining about the bugs and such, but it went by well enough.

during the match, however, one of the heads of camp approached me, with a girl roughly the age of ten at her side, let's call her tina (nowhere near her real name) and asked me to walk her back and get her a band-aid; she scratched a bug bite on her leg and it started bleeding. *alright,* i thought, *simple enough, just go to the front office, grab a band-aid, and send her on her way.*

we walk side-by-side on the way back to the building; however in an attempt to be the gentleman i wish i was, i speed up to open the door for her... locked. alright, try the second door... locked again. i then look over to the second set of doors, where there's one propped open already. (*strike 1*)

slightly humiliated, we enter the building to the main area, head left to the head office, and... it's locked. in the main area sits a friend of mine, who asks what's up, and i briefly explain my need for a band-aid.

"we have a first-aid kit that's in the kitchen," he replies. *oh right, that was explained to us earlier this week.* (*strike 2*)

i lead tina across the main area to the kitchen, slightly red-faced now (i was, not her), and prop open the large plastic box containing everything we needed... that is, until she points out that blood is slowly dripping down her leg, prompting me to grab a paper towel.

i turn around to see an empty towel dispenser, beside metal rolling tables that had two rolls of paper towels not even thirty minutes ago, both are now gone, leaving me a bit more frustrated than i should be. "there's some more paper towels over there." i turn around and i see tina pointing across the kitchen. i then go over to where i *think* she was pointing.

"no, it's over there!" she pointed at the same place. good news is that she was smiling (which i seldom see her do) getting a kick out of my stupidity, so she's not upset about the fact that blood is dripping down her leg, which furthers my stress and frustration.

i finally spotted a second paper towel dispenser, and angrily push a chair that was in my way to get in, which raised the eyebrow of an old lady witnessing this, so now i made a bad impression to someone i go to church with. (*strike 3*)

i tear out a piece, get some water on it, then baton pass it to tina as i run past her to stop at the first-aid kit to get the frickin' band-aid. i unwrap it, then ask her "you can probably put this on yourself, can't you?"

i gave it to her, she sealed the wound and we returned to the field, confirming my fears of having kids of my own someday.

    Here is the summary: The author, a volunteer counselor at a week-long Hellenic camp, struggles to provide a simple band-aid to a camper named Tina due to a series of locked doors and missing supplies, causing frustration and embarrassment for the author

    Here is the article: this just happened about half an hour ago.

i left my apartment in the early afternoon on sunday for a weekly meet up with my friends in an adjacent city. when i returned home, i went straight to bed, exhausted at midnight. 

the following afternoon, i woke up (yes i slept until 1) and went about as normal. at about 3 i started to get hungry, so i went and checked my fridge. at first i was just puzzled, because the light bulb didn't come on. i pushed the switch several times, but nothing happened. then i noticed there was no sound. and then i noticed that everything in the fridge was barely cold. i opened the freezer, and most of my meat had thawed, but was still pretty cold. so i started checking all the other appliances, and my entire kitchen would not turn on. breaker switches were all fine, so i was stumped.i freaked out and called my landlord, who called an electrician. the electrician would not be able to come out for 2 full days!

this is where i made fuck up #1. instead of immediately going to the store and getting an extension cord to plug the fridge into a different outlet, i waited until about an hour ago. i ran to the store, and ran back home, hoping i could save some of my freezer food.

this is where the big fu happens. i unplug my fridge, and unplug the surge protector that had my microwave and toaster oven. the fridge cord won't reach the surge protector, and the stuff plugged in to the surge protector prevent me from reaching the fridge. i go to plug the thing back in, and notice a red button that says "reset". i pushed the button. and everything turned back on. i am an idiot, and now i have no food.

    Here is the summary: The author left their apartment for a weekly meetup with friends but returned home to find that their kitchen appliances, including the fridge, would not turn on

this is where i made fuck up #1. instead of immediately going to the store and getting an extension cord to plug the fridge into a different outlet, i waited until about an hour ago. i ran to the store, and ran back home, hoping i could save some of my freezer food.

this is where the big fu happens. i unplug my fridge, and unplug the surge protector that had my microwave and toaster oven. the fridge cord won't reach the surge protector, and the stuff plugged in to the surge protector prevent me from reaching the fridge. i go to plug the thing back in, and notice a red button that says "reset". i pushed the button. and everything turned back on. i am an idiot, and now i have no food.

    Here is the summary: The author returned home from a weekly gathering with friends to find that their kitchen appliances, including the fridge, were not working due to a power outage

    Here is the article: this happened last week but i'm still recovering from the trauma and anguish so i'm deciding to post it now. my boyfriend of three years, lets call him eric and i were gearing up to go to his parents house for dinner last saturday. we did this maybe once a month or so and everything usually went fine. his parents loved me and we always had a good time. 

this time we were running a little late and eric told me to hurry it up a little. so i put on a cardigan, some jeans and my trusty converse. i chose to forego tying the converse because i figured i'd be taking them off anyways once we got to his parents house. now the thing about my converse is that the laces are really long, like they easily extend past my feet. this will be important later in the story.

anyway, we drive to eric's parents house which is about 15 minutes away, and when we get there, eric's parents along with his brother and his girlfriend are already waiting outside. we hastily get out and this is where everything goes to shit.

the next 5 minutes were surreal, like something out of a movie but i it actually happened and i really wish it didn't. as i get out of the car i do a little half hop half jog to give eric's mom a hug like i always do. becuase of this weird movement, the shoelace of my left converse ends up lodged under my right foot, and as i raise my other foot the lace pulls taut and sends me careening. hands flailing i fly full speed into eric's poor mother and tackle her into the porch steps. a little dazed i get up and i see blood on the steps. eric, his brother and his dad quickly come to his mom's side trying to help her up. in the panic, i remember we have napkins in the car. as i'm running back to the car i step on my shoelace again, and my foot stops in mid air as a launch myself head first into the sidedoor of my boyfriend's civic. next thing i know, i'm lying on the sofa and everyone's crowded around me looking concerned. it turns out eric's mom got a small cut on the back of her head and was mostly fine. me on the other hand, i went to the hospital and was diagnosed with a concussion, not to mention a severe case of mortal embarrassment. anyways, if you take anything out of this story, it's always tie your shoes.

    Here is the article: i just got a job within the last two weeks!

so after work today i end up getting into my car and turn the key. lo and behold, i don't hear a single god damned thing and the bitch doesn't turn. what was i to do but get a jump and be on my way?

so i go back in and talk to my assistant manager to see if she knew anyone with jumper cables. turns out, she has some!

wow! great! superb, even!

so she brings her car around, we wait for a few seconds to give her some juice and she starts right up. i was begining to feel better since the thing died when the shit goes down, and boy does it go down.

her car was parked rather close to mine and she was near her door on the driver side but her post rod for the hood was on the passenger side. she asked me if i could drop her hood for her. 

as i go for the thing i reflect on how it's thinner on the bottom half than the top. 

"oh okay cool! it's one of those hydraulic hoods so i can just push it down with ease!" 

but i was so wrong. so very, very wrong.

as i proceed to push down on her hood, it starts bending at the point the rod was to the most ungodly angle. the damn thing was so bent it couldn't even shut, not to mention cracking the paint. 

after her "oh my god what are you doing?!" reaction i apologized profusely, bent the hood back into shape and offered to pay her for the damages. now i'm laying in bed, thankful of everything that is holy that i don't have work tomorrow.

    Here is the article: obligatory: this happened 10 years ago when i was 17 (2006); when i was a high school senior; when i was on the school's senior ball team.

now at that time, my high school had fire alarm pull handles in the gym which protruded, were of a curved design, and had clear plastic covers over them.

let's just say that, during a game, i missed the teammate i was trying to pass to, who was just inches away from out of bounds; the ball went into the oob zone and then knocked the clear plastic cover of the fire alarm pull switch which somehow activated the alarm (something i never knew until then as i thought you had to pull it; til).

the game stopped when the alarm started to go off. luckily for me and probably all of us, the school principal was watching the game and saw what happened, so he went to explain to the firefighters who just rolled in and hopped out of their truck, and they left after shutting it off.

needless to say, the school got for the gym some new, flat-design pull handles, made recesses in the walls so their fronts would be flush with the wall when mounted, and put metal doors over them that balls couldn't knock open **and** couldn't activate the alarm. at least i (or anyone else on the team, or even the whole team) never had to pay as it was just an accident and "shitty design" (exact words of the principal).

 

**edit** i believe i f'du by slowing down the game because we were ordered to stop until the firefighters came to shut it off

    Here is the summary: During a high school basketball game 10 years ago, I accidentally activated the fire alarm by knocking the clear plastic cover of the pull handle with the ball, causing the game to be halted and the school to replace the pull handles with new, flat designs

    Here is the article: as is tradition this didn't happen today but at the start of the week.

i'm out and about with my work at the moment providing training to staff and part of that is showing a presentation via a projector. well in this particular office the projector wasn't focused correctly and was bugging me to no end. so i decided to do something about it and just adjust it slightly. unfortunately this board room has 8 tables put together in 2 rows of 4 meaning that if i want to adjust it correctly i will have to move the tables, get a stepladder, adjust it, move the stepladder away, put the tables back in place, and to quote sweet brown, ain't nobody got time for that. 

so, i climb gallantly onto the table and begin adjusting the projector until it focuses perfectly and i can continue on with my presentation. however! the osha gods do not look kindly on this misuse of a table and decided to fight back. the second i take one step to get down the table flips to one side. i have a millisecond of floating in midair, i can see the floor below me, i see the table titled and i can hear myself thinking 'fuck'. 

i landed in a heap on the floor, on my ass. on the trip down i managed to scrape my thigh on one side of the other tables and apparently do some damage. after being lifted off the floor by one of the managers (who was nearly crying with laughter), i regained myself and carried on with the presentation. at lunch i went to the toilet to check my leg and realised how badly i had hurt myself and how much of a bruise i was in for. 

the cherry on top is that i have a race tomorrow, just under a week after falling and my leg still aches.

    Here is the article: in true tifu fashion, this happened my senior year of high school in 2012. 

 

pics: http://imgur.com/a/p9e02

here's a little back story. i went to a very small, private high school. our track team didn't have any pole vaulters, or even a coach. so i decided to try it out, having some past pole vaulters mentor me. 
after a few months, i had it down pretty well. i was practicing more and more on my own.
in mid may, our junior class and their parents host an annual dinner for the senior class. this is a huge dinner with parents and teachers and pictures and whatnot. something i looked forward to for a long time.
the morning of the dinner, we had track practice at our usual time. it was a saturday morning, just kind of a laid back practice. so i decided to practice pole vault on my own. 
on one of the jumps, i didn't clear the practice bungee, so i relaxed my whole body and just landed comfortably. wrong! relaxing your body is not what you should do, especially if you don't realize your legs are hovering right over your face. i was kind of in a cannonball position, but my legs weren't squeezed to my chest. my back and head hit the mat, and my knee followed, jamming my septum into my skull. i basically just kneed myself in the face. well, gravity did all the work. 
i left practice and saw the school nurse who suggested i get x-rays immediately. i did so, and 45 minutes later, found out i had deviated(broken) my septum(small bone in my nose) in 2 places, while also sinking it into my skull. 
i went to my senior dinner with a very crooked nose and black eye. such great things to have during my senior pictures.
had surgery the following tuesday to reset my septum, and i polevaulted the next week in subsections.

    Here is the summary: During your senior year of high school in 2012, you tried pole vaulting despite your school not having a coach or other pole vaulters, and you eventually became quite skilled at it

    Here is the article: this happened about 30 minutes ago. fuck me. 

so i've been talking with a girl i really like for the past week (we'll call her 'm'), and she kinda likes me as well. she is extremely cute, but has huge self confidence and trust issues.
anyway, i was texting m earlier, and at the same time i was showing my brother a website i've recently discovered. apparently this was a bad idea. 

my conversation with m had fizzled out a little, and my brother and i were having a lot of fun with this website, so i ended up focusing on that more than i should have.

suddenly she texts me "am i annoying you because i can go".

of course, i wanted to tell her that she didn't annoy me. why would she? she's not annoying in the slightest. so i attempted to tell her just that. now i'm generally a fast typer, and i never proofread the messages i send. so of course, i left out a word in my sentence. 

i ended up texting her back "you annoy me, sorry if i can be a little quiet sometimes"

see what i did there? i left out the word "don't". what the fuck is wrong with me.

m: "i'll go, don't bother messaging back"

so now i'm frantically trying to correct the typo, and tell her what i really meant, but she doesn't believe i made a mistake. i'm still talking to her now trying to sort everything out.

    Here is the summary: The writer inadvertently told a girl he likes that she annoys him, due to a typo in a text message

so i've been talking with a girl i really like for the past week (we'll call her 'm'), and she kinda likes me as well. she is extremely cute, but has huge self confidence and trust issues.
anyway, i was texting m earlier, and at the same time i was showing my brother a website i've recently discovered. apparently this was a bad idea. 

my conversation with m had fizzled out a little, and my brother and i were having a lot of fun with this website, so i ended up focusing on that more than i should have.

suddenly she texts me "am i annoying you because i can go".

of course, i wanted to tell her that she didn't annoy me. why would she? she's not annoying in the slightest. so i attempted to tell her just that. now i'm generally a fast typer, and i never proofread the messages i send. so of course, i left out a word in my sentence. 

i ended up texting her back "you annoy me, sorry if i can be a little quiet sometimes"

see what i did there? i left out the word "don't". what the fuck is wrong with me.

m: "i'll go, don't bother messaging back"

so now i'm frantically trying to correct the typo, and tell her what i really meant, but she doesn't believe i made a mistake. i'm still talking to her now trying to sort everything out.

    Here is the summary: The writer inadvertently told someone they annoy them when they meant to say they don't annoy them

    Here is the article: this actually happened last night, but i'm feeling the repercussions now.
i've been recently turned on to the show rick and morty, and being a new fan i wanted to share it with someone. my wife is out of town this week, so i decided to watch the alien parasites episode with my boys before bed. i knew some of the language was a bit much, but my boys have been ok with the occasional bad word in the past. if you've seen the episode, you know about mr. poopy butthole. if you haven't, could someone post the link please? anyway, the first thing out of my older son's mouth this morning was questions about why mr. poopy butthole did certain things he did in the episode. my younger son heard me talking to his brother about it and started to make up some song about the show, coming in strong on the chorus of mr. poopy butthole. this was hilarious to his older brother, who started making up his own lyrics to the song. nothing i did nor any threat i made could get them to stop saying mr. poopy butthole and laughing hysterically. they both stepped onto their respective buses singing this made-up song about a guy named mr. poopy butthole. i am going to get angry emails from teachers today, and my wife is going to be so pissed off at me.

    Here is the article: obligatory disclaimer: this didn't happen today. it happened yesterday.

i usually like to stay up late watching movies on my bed because it helps me unwind and most of the time, it's the only truly worry-free time i get. like most people with this habit, i also dose off in the middle most of the time. this was one of those times. as per usual, i was on my bed enjoying myself and started getting a little drowsy. i decided to pause and rest my eyes for a bit, put my head on my arm, headphones still on, and ended up falling asleep.

i woke up at around 1 am to my hand feeling numb and tired. *no big deal, my sleeping situation wasn't exactly ideal. it'll go away soon.* i looked it over and there was a pretty deep looking crease on my forearm where my head was. *it's okay, these things happen.* so i got comfortable and went back to sleep.

my alarm woke me 7 hours later. i got up and went through my morning routine when i noticed something weird. i still couldn't feel my hand. i could move it around, but all feeling was gone. *that can't be right.* so i rushed to the on-campus clinic. they sent me to the physiotherapy department in the nearby hospital where i explained my situation to the doctor. he looked me over and wrote me up for 3 days of ultrasound treatment. apparently, the pressure from the thin metal support on the headphones damaged a nerve where i slept on my arm and that's why i couldn't feel a thing on the back of my hand. i'm on day 1 and may have to try other forms of treatment if it doesn't improve.

the seconds after that, i have absolutely no memory of. i thought i was waking up from a dream when i felt myself being hoisted into some vehicle...it was the ambulance. sent to the er, crash had given me a concussion. helmet is destroyed, bike has scratches, and it also has a new scratch of blue paint...however police are telling me that i crashed on my own (as someone who has ridden a century and also fell off my bike at higher speeds than those on my fixie without a concussion, this seems highly suspectable.) because it was determined to be a one party incident, there were no witness statements taken at the time, i didn't get any chance to speak to an officer on the scene (as i was knocked out), no businesses nearby have security cameras facing the street, there were no cars in the immediate area around the incident, and it's unkonwn at this time what effects of the concussion are going to be persisting, if any. if anything did happen, it would've been a perfect crime.

    Here is the article: we have a conference room that also serves as a reading room (if you wish to use some of the wast company library to study there) and there is a schedule so that you know when some meetings will be held there. i forgot to read it and so this starts.

took a book, went there, felt drowsy and after a little while i dozed off.
was awakened by my direct supervisor (he is also a very very good friend of the company's ceo).

and there were also 2 of our future clients (and a very important deal was about to be signed). to make best of the situation my boss said (pure genius): "you will have to excuse our employee, he has a condition" 

(to clarify even more he meant narcolepsy)

they nodded and smiled, the pressure was wiped clean. until i had to start blabbering (why, ouh why didn’t i keep my mouth shut?) "yea, its called necrophilia!"

the look of pure shock on our clients faces, the look of exploding volcano on my bosses face... priceless. i just packed those books and left.

 

update: didn't get fired, got of with a warning, thanks to whatever higher force involved! :d

update 2: just go to work today and ofc the word spread like wildfire. guess who's the local "necro-boy" now? (that's the best they came up with so far)

    Here is the article: ok so technically this fuck up was last week, but i had no way of knowing this until today.

(for the record i am a first year uni student and puts much work in my academics to keep up my scholarships; not going into personal life but i need all the monetary help i can get)

so the previous two weeks i wrote my midterms and this week i am receiving the marks back. i had high hopes for this class in particular; i had done pretty shit on the assignments and was really hoping that this midterm, worth 25% of my grade would help boost my grade. it helps that i put a lot of time in studying and i had finished the midterm early, feeling pretty confident with my mark.

so, on the last class of the week, i felt my heart leap when i saw i barely passed (51%).

it only took a few seconds of flipping thorugh the exam to figure out where i went wrong.

somehow, i had stopped at question 50.

maybe it was the layout of the scantron (multiple choice card) which stops at 50 at the front. perhaps it was the way the exam was structured as to place a nice even 50 at the bottom of the 3rd last page. but somehow, my brain reached the nice logical conclusion that i was done now, i could go home.
so now, i will proceed to get black out drunk tonight as i am possibly at risk of losing most of my funding of education.

    Here is the article: so this actually only happened about an hour ago. a real tifu. i was sitting at my desk, playing wow as i always do, and i noticed my hearing was a little off, so i figured i'd clean my ears. i'm in a raid, so most of my attention in on the game, but now that i've noticed it, its bugging me. 

i grab a towel and wrap it around my neck, grab the saline and tilt my head to one side. i fill up my ear with the saline, and let it soak for a minute... or at least, that was the plan, before it starting to hurt. a lot.

i quickly tilt my head the other way and let the liquid flow out. i look at the bottle and surprise surprise. its not saline. its computer and tv screen cleaner. head still tilted to the side, i desperately check the ingredients, not that i know what could be harmful. it doesn't hurt anymore more, but, in my panic, i managed to kill my whole team on wow. 

happy times.

she invites me to meet her parents she hasn't told me a single thing about them so i ask but she said you will just have to see. it's now 11 am and i pick her up from her place and i ask the address, she said i will just show you. at this point i'm a bit confused why she isn't telling me a single thing... after about an hours drive we pull into an estate that looked fancy. i thought ok they might be a little bit wealthy maybe retired here or something. what i found out next, her dad is (was going to say the name but for my privacy and hers i won't) a well known politician here in australia whom i do not like and i have told this girl that i don't like this politician before.

this man was involved in raising prices for uni and tafe students and the reason behind making a lot of people quit because they simply couldn't offered it. i shake his hand and at the exact time of touching his old wrinkly hand i splurged out the words "wish i had a big house like this, i might have been able to finish my degree" .... yeah, he pulls his hand away and asks me to leave. but no that wasn't the fuck up.

as i pull out of the drive way in complete anger that this girl didn't tell me who her dad was i backed into the huge gate at the end of the drive way. i panicked and drove off, 3 mins later i was getting pulled over by 6 police cars, 20 mins later i was in lock up and 9 hours later i get a court date for vandalising and assaulting a politician. 

i'm waiting to see if i make the newspaper or news i kinda hope i do it will really top everything off.

    Here is the article: i made a hot pocket in the oven last night, and i of course needed to test if it was cool enough to eat. so i used the most appropriate method i could think of, i took a small bite[7]. superheated "cheese" comes out, but no big surprises there.

i proceeded to devour both pockets and sooth my burning lips and mouth with an icy beer. i went about my night and everything was normal. this morning i noticed i had burned my bottom lip near the right corner. it wasn't too bad, just a small blister i noticed while shaving. 

i went to work and went about my day, and proceeded to forget about my burned lip. i got off work and met up with my girlfriend. she gives me a big kiss, which then pops the blister. she pulls away quickly as i reach towards the blister. she looks at my lip and asks me what is on it. i say it's just a blister, but she just keeps staring and analyzing it. after a minute she picks up her purse and says, "no, that's herpes", calls me an asshole and accused me of cheating on her. she tells me we're over and started freaking out that she now has herpes. i keep trying to tell her it's a hot pocket burn as she leaves the bar, but she just stormed out flipping me the bird while everyone just gave me a death stare. 

i checked out myself in the mirror and the blister popped really badly, it looks pretty nasty, but i don't think it looks like herpes. 

this all happened an hour ago and she's not answering my texts or calls.

i had just finished up eating my dinner, so i went and cleaned my dishes. i opened the dishwasher and went to pull the bottom tray. on the bottom tray we have a small box-like thing in the middle of the lower tray for all the forks, knives and spoons. i wasn't looking when i reached down to pull out the tray.

next thing i knew, i had stuck an end of a fork that was sitting upright between my ring finger and the fingernail. stung like hell and bled pretty badly. didn't get real mangled or anything, it's just really painful and sensitive. pretty anticlimactic, imo.

    Here is the article: took the dog out for a walk and decided to not put phone in its case because it was to much effort. ran across the road to a roundabout in the middle. as i was running from the roundabout to the other side of the road my phone fell out of my pocket. however i didn't realise as i was trying to not get run over. unfortunately for me it fell straight into the path of my on coming foot. 

it was a sweet connection though. the power, the accuracy, the technique. think danny rose against arsenal, think 
zinedine zidane against bayer leverkusen, think robin van persie against aston villa. it was amazing, incredible. it was perfect.

until it smashed against a wall

    Here is the article: so that's basically it. i was at the airport and had about 5 minutes left before boarding. i noticed i really needed to pee so i rushed down to the toilets. i came into a room with two cabins and someone came out of the left cabin. i didn't really want to sit on a toilet which had been butt-heated by a stranger right away so i turned to the right cabin. 
the door lock was half on 'closed' and 'open' i just assumed it was free. i  opened the door and there she was.  an old, small lady pulling up her pants. i froze, mumbled a quick 'sorry' and closed the door immediately. she said something like 'it's okay, nothing happened' but i just rushed into the other cabin and hid there until she was gone. i still made it to boarding on time and so did she. we ended up sitting in the same row with some business dude between us. so awkward...

    Here is the article: important back story is that i rarely ever drink alcohol.  i will have half a beer once every month or so.  i get buzzed on half a beer, and my husband has to finish it for me.  so when i get buzzed,  i joke that i am getting drunk,  because i never get drunk.  i am often teased among our friends as always sober. 

the weekend before, i was at a basketball game with my family and was bored and tired.  so i drank an entire beer,  which is unusual.  i joked to my husband that i was drunk.  (but i really wasn't) 

on to the tifu... 

my daughter takes karate lessons, and my husband normally takes her.  my younger son does not take karate,  he is too young and just goes to watch.  

this day,  i took the kids to karate because of a schedule change.  so none of the karate parents really know me,  since daddy always brings them.  some of the moms don't really like me much because they are  clique-ish and don't talk to me.  my husband, they like and are nice to him.  

so my 3 yr old slumps down,  and says,  "mom,  i'm drunk."  i don't think he know what that means so i ask him what he means by that.  he replies,  "drunk means i'm bored and tired."  i laugh,  "where did you hear that?"
 
"you! you were drunk at the basketball game!"  he loudly proclaims.  the room of watching parents go dead silent.   

i realized that there is nothing i can say to correct this.  i can't explain it without looking like i am a drunk in denial. so i change the subject and let him play a game on my phone. 

now they not only dislike me,  they think i'm a drunk.

    Here is the summary: After I jokingly told my 3-year-old son that I was "drunk" at a basketball game, he loudly proclaimed in front of a room full of watching parents that "Mom is drunk!"

    Here is the article: so this did not happen today, but over this last summer. i live with my mother in oregon and every summer we go to california for a month to visit with the grandparents, aunts, uncles, all of those extra family members. i have two younger cousins and an older cousin. the two younger cousins play football, and their team had won the final game of their season. so as a celebration my aunt and uncle invited me to a get together with my cousins team and have a big potluck barbecue styled shindig. 

my uncle whenever it comes to potlucks and barbecues always likes to go all out. he was making a tremendous amount of chicken for this barbecue. his plan was to marinate this monstrous batch of chicken over night using a laundry tub, a garbage bag to hold the sauce and chicken in, and some bags of ice to put around it to keep the chicken fresh. everything throughout the day went absolutely swimmingly. chicken was marinating real good, absolutely intoxicating aroma of sweetly marinated teriyaki chicken. you could lose yourself in it’s scent. 
that night i was helping him move the chicken from the garbage bag in the tub to a cooler so that it will be ready to slap on the grill right when we get there, we had a ton of chicken and needed to cook it fast. so we drag our cooler, and laundry tub loaded with chicken to the driveway to make the switch into the cooler.
 
this is where the fuck up starts. my uncle said that it would take forever to move all of the chicken into the cooler. i, wanting to be the hero of the day, said, “why don’t you just pick up the bag and dump the chicken in the cooler, rather than just scooping it up.” my uncle was not a smart guy, and apparently neither was i at the time, because he said he liked the idea. so here we both go, grabbing onto the top of the bag and pulling the bag out slowly. he told me to start tipping over the tub so we can quickly just “toss” the bag of chicken into the cooler. we were stupid in thinking this idea would work. the horror in my uncle’s eyes as the garbage bag ripped from the overwhelming weight of it’s contents was only surpassed by the shock in my head as over 30 pounds of marinated chicken spilled all over his gravely, suburban driveway. never before had i felt so bad, it was my idea to transfer the chicken this way. my uncle was almost in tears. our only batch of chicken that took a whole day to marinate was spilled all over the driveway, and we had no time to make another batch because the bbq was the next day. 
 
he was so aggressive when he yelled at my cousins to get the garden hose. we spent the next two hours hosing off, ripping apart, and thoroughly cleaning off every single piece of chicken. throwing away unsalvageable parts. about 30% of the chicken was lost, and my back ached horribly because i had to crouch down and hose off the chicken, and felt too bad to ask for a chair. by the end or our little endeavor, both mine and his hands reeked of blood, teriyaki sauce, and shame.

the barbeque came, the chicken was fucking delicious. luckily none of the 40+ people that had come got sick, or noticed anything off about the chicken. in fact they only had compliments to say about it. in my close family me and my uncle became known as “the best street chicken vendors on the streets...literally.”

    Here is the summary: My uncle and I attempted to transfer 30 pounds of marinated chicken from a garbage bag to a cooler, but the bag ripped and spilled all over the driveway, resulting in a two-hour cleanup process and the loss of 30% of the chicken

    Here is the article: this happened back in college around 2006.


just so folks know, i'm as laid back of a midwesterner you can imagine. nothing gives me stress. stress doesn't induce panic. however, on this particular night, in an intimate crowd of 300 in paris, i wanted to crawl in a hole and die.


to the tifu: so i was invited to join a university professor as a photography intern to both puerto rico and paris. we would be spending a few weeks in each location. we were essentially hired to shoot and deliver a final evening video presentation at each trip. a recap, if you will. now, keep in mind, this was for c-level management of a major vehicle brand — as well as multi-car dealership owners from around the country (usa). we're talking millions in costs for the brand and hundreds of guests who were accustomed to top-notch service. 


now, my role was to head out on daily excursions and take photographs of the guests. think of places like the louvre to underwater snorkeling in the ocean. easy-peasy as i buttered up the guests with charm and delivered some cool photographs in the end. however, the main reason i was sent was to create a computer slide-show that would hollywood blockbuster the guests. puerto rico was trip one, presentation went without a hitch, and the guests were dazzled.


fast forward to the moment i'll never live down. on the final night in a 10 day trip to paris, i was putting together the slide-show on a small laptop with hundreds of photos throughout the week. what i forgot to do was resize the images as they'll be projected up to a massive screen. instead, hundreds of photographs were getting loaded into a program, on a slow running laptop, into said presentation program at full resolution. this, just hours before go time.


what ensued was to be expected. at first, the computer started up with the obligatory wheel of death. eventually, it reached its limit and just crashed. for two hours it wouldn't even start up. on top of that, moments before the wheel of death, the video file (think stop-motion animation) of the ceo at the ritz hotel chef school was now coming up corrupt. abc'ya later, all that work out the window. 


dear god, dear dear god, we're in full panic mode.


thinking on his feet, my professor basically said "ennnealioo, screw it, let's just play the images from start to finish right from the computer folder. screw the program." as we finally got the computer started in the ballroom where the event was being held.


the evening was all set. 100+ guests were seated. meal was served. the master of ceremony made a huge introduction for our photo presentation before a b-list music group was to get on stage. i hit play, hoping some miracle would allow for the images to run straight through so people could at least see their trip recap. not today. that's now how this one goes. a moment later, i realized that i'd clicked the photo option to "shuffle" as i clicked play. that means 4 of the same image were getting shuffled back and forth to summarize over a week of incredible travel for hundreds of guests. cue laughing. hundreds were now laughing hysterically. and, to top it off, my professor was pacing behind me saying "well, my career is over... this is it... i'll never be hired again"

the nightmares continue to this day.

    Here is the summary: The author, a laid-back Midwesterner, had a disastrous experience while working as a photography intern for a university professor in Paris, where they accidentally shuffled the same image four times during a presentation for C-level management and multi-car dealership owners, leading to hysterical laughter from the guests and a panicked professor

    Here is the article: this happened back in college around 2006.


just so folks know, i'm as laid back of a midwesterner you can imagine. nothing gives me stress. stress doesn't induce panic. however, on this particular night, in an intimate crowd of 300 in paris, i wanted to crawl in a hole and die.


to the tifu: so i was invited to join a university professor as a photography intern to both puerto rico and paris. we would be spending a few weeks in each location. we were essentially hired to shoot and deliver a final evening video presentation at each trip. a recap, if you will. now, keep in mind, this was for c-level management of a major vehicle brand — as well as multi-car dealership owners from around the country (usa). we're talking millions in costs for the brand and hundreds of guests who were accustomed to top-notch service. 


now, my role was to head out on daily excursions and take photographs of the guests. think of places like the louvre to underwater snorkeling in the ocean. easy-peasy as i buttered up the guests with charm and delivered some cool photographs in the end. however, the main reason i was sent was to create a computer slide-show that would hollywood blockbuster the guests. puerto rico was trip one, presentation went without a hitch, and the guests were dazzled.


fast forward to the moment i'll never live down. on the final night in a 10 day trip to paris, i was putting together the slide-show on a small laptop with hundreds of photos throughout the week. what i forgot to do was resize the images as they'll be projected up to a massive screen. instead, hundreds of photographs were getting loaded into a program, on a slow running laptop, into said presentation program at full resolution. this, just hours before go time.


what ensued was to be expected. at first, the computer started up with the obligatory wheel of death. eventually, it reached its limit and just crashed. for two hours it wouldn't even start up. on top of that, moments before the wheel of death, the video file (think stop-motion animation) of the ceo at the ritz hotel chef school was now coming up corrupt. abc'ya later, all that work out the window. 


dear god, dear dear god, we're in full panic mode.


thinking on his feet, my professor basically said "ennnealioo, screw it, let's just play the images from start to finish right from the computer folder. screw the program." as we finally got the computer started in the ballroom where the event was being held.


the evening was all set. 100+ guests were seated. meal was served. the master of ceremony made a huge introduction for our photo presentation before a b-list music group was to get on stage. i hit play, hoping some miracle would allow for the images to run straight through so people could at least see their trip recap. not today. that's now how this one goes. a moment later, i realized that i'd clicked the photo option to "shuffle" as i clicked play. that means 4 of the same image were getting shuffled back and forth to summarize over a week of incredible travel for hundreds of guests. cue laughing. hundreds were now laughing hysterically. and, to top it off, my professor was pacing behind me saying "well, my career is over... this is it... i'll never be hired again"

the nightmares continue to this day.

    Here is the summary: The author, a laid-back Midwesterner, experienced a disastrous moment during a work trip to Paris in 2006 when they accidentally shuffled the same four images repeatedly while presenting a photo slideshow to a group of 100+ guests, including C-level management of a major vehicle brand and multi-car dealership owners, resulting in hysterical laughter and a professor muttering about the author's career being over

being a college student our cafeteria has strict hours on the weekend for when you can go eat, dinner is from 4-6pm. so we have a really small time frame to work with when trying to catch a meal especially when you are in the library like i was on this night, i know it was halloween but hey i needed to study. so i ended up missing dinner and had to go drive myself to a near fast-food stop to get something to eat. it was around 8pm when i had left so it was pretty dark outside and the trick-o-treaters were out in full swing all dressed up. i had made it to burger king, ordered, and received my food without an issue. on the way back however i was driving about 25mph in almost pitch black, apparently street lamps are non-existent on this street, with little kids and their parents all around me when suddenly i see an orange and white cat dart across the street right in front of my tires. that sucker went right under my right wheel and hear this mom shriek "he killed a f-ing cat!". i started panicking and didn't stop. i mortified many small, toddlers/ children that day.

    Here is the article: to set the background, i dated a girl for a year and a half and we very recently broke up. she at one point bought pink spandex for running, but they were too big for her, and since i wear compression shorts for underwear, i told her i'd take them as a joke. she gave them to me.

today, before work i realized i had no clean underwear and no time to do laundry. i tore apart my room until i came across the pink shorts, and decided "hey, these are as good as any." so i put them on and went to work. i was smoking a cigarette on my break, and went to mcdonald's for a quick bite. the server handed me my food through the drive thru window, but she sort of pushed it at me, and knocked my cigarette out of my hand onto my seat. i picked it up quickly, and brushed off a little piece of ash that had landed on my thigh. 

suddenly, i smelled something burning, and an instant later, searing pain shot up the back of my leg right by my ass. i pretty much had to stand up in my car and put out that ash, that i apparently had been sitting on. when i got back to work (i work in retail) a customer told me on his way out that he liked my fashion sense. i was like... what the hell haha we're all in uniform? but i quickly realized that the ash from the cigarette had burned a decent size hole right through the ass of my pants, and my hot pink spandex could be seen clear as day.

later on, apparently a couple people mentioned it, because i got pulled aside by my manager, who told me "we support individuality, but we are in uniform here. you need to make sure you adhere to the dress code." i was given my final warning (i have been late a few times) all because i didn't do my laundry.

    Here is the article: as with pretty much every post on this subreddit, this didn't happen today, it happened a few years ago, when i was in 11th grade to be exact.  for a bit of context, i went to a charter school from grades 6-12 for "gifted" students that specialized in students who had adhd, autism disorders, social anxiety etc.  i had some interesting friends at this school, all of whom were... eccentric, but also crazy smart,  a couple of people i knew at this school knew how to make/ modify/repair everything from fireworks, to canons to cars to computers.  

  this fu happened on one particular day after school with two friends of mine that we'll call "l" and "j".  l decided to show us a quick recipe he'd found for solid rocket fuel.  the recipe in question is a mixture of table sugar and potassium chlorate mixed together in a 65/35 ratio.  in addition, the fuel could be made to burn better if it was heated until the sugar caramelized.  so that's what we decided to do, l got the ingredients weighed them out until we had a 200g mixture, and j and i heated the mixture in a frying pan and stirred it with a spoon (this is important later) on his dad's barbecue.

after 10 minutes or so the mixture had turned into a sticky brown slurry (which smelled delicious btw).  we poured the mixture into an old plastic bucket and took it out onto his back lawn to let it cool.  as we're waiting for it to cool i turn to l and ask "are we lighting this whole thing, or just a little bit?" to which l replies "nonono, that'd be way to much, go get the stirring spoon and light whatever's left on that, that should give you an idea of how reactive this stuff is".  so i go and grab the spoon, which has some residual mixture stuck to it, and a lighter, and bring it back to where l and j are waiting on the lawn.  this is where the fu proper begins, i light the spoon and it catches pretty quickly, burning a bright pink colour and sending little sparks everywhere.......including into the bucket of fuel, right by my feet.  no sooner have we realize what's happened and gotten out of the way than a column of hot pink fire erupts from the bucket was with a loud foom.  the column quickly engulfs the bucket and grows to about 5 feet tall in a just a few seconds, at this point all my friends and i can do is sit and watch the fireworks.  after about 30 seconds the fire starts to go down, and after about a minute it sputters out.  once the smoke clears we see absolutely nothing is left of the bucket, the lawn around the spot where it stood has had all of the grass scorched away, and the neighbours are giving us a dirty look from their kitchen windows.  luckily none of got in trouble for the mishap, and neither friend is angry with me since they didn't think to move the rocket fuel either.

    Here is the article: this fuck up happened two days ago (or yesterday depending on how you think about it) so i'm only a little late to this. here's a little backstory. i am currently in my senior year of high school. there's this girl who i've had a huge crush on since freshman hear. all throughout high school, we have been amazing friends. 


this year i finally decided to grow a pair of balls and ask her out. homecoming is coming up soon, so i saw that as the perfect way to do it. i bought flowers, chocolate, and even wrote a song in which i ask her to homecoming. two days ago i was completely ready to do it. in the high school i go to we have off hours where you basically can do whatever the fuck you want, and go wherever the fuck you want because it's an open campus. we both had 5th period off, so i figured that would be the perfect time to do it. 


so there i am getting the guitar, flowers, and chocolate out of my locker when all of a sudden i get this feeling in my bowels - it's the chipotle i ate during lunch. i don't want to ask her out while holding in a massive shit. i figure i'll go take a dump, grab my stuff, find her, and then ask her out.


the first two steps go perfectly well, but she's not in our usual meeting spot and she's not answering her phone. "oh well, i'll just do it tomorrow". i soon come to regret those words. 


the next day, i go through the same process (without taking a massive shit). i see her at our usual meeting spot, walk up to her, and before i can say anything she blurts out "james asked me out to homecoming!" fuck.


 "oh cool. when did he ask you?" 


"5th period yesterday. i figured you were sick when you didn't show up, so i walked over to starbucks and that's when he asked me."


"nice!"


god damnit. never again will i eat chipotle. damn them and the fiery shit's they give me. so now here i am, still laying in bed with the flowers and empty chocolate box in the trash can next to me, with nothing better to do than write a tifu about this.

    Here is the summary: The author had a crush on a girl since freshman year and finally mustered up the courage to ask her out to homecoming, but his plans were foiled when he got a stomachache from eating Chipotle and the girl ended up accepting another guy's invitation instead

    Here is the article: so this morning before the end of my shift, i'm an er nurse, i needed to give a medication called rocuronium (a paralytic agent used before intubation). so i have the vial in my hand and syringe in the other drawing up the medication and a few drops dripped on my finger. all of a sudden i felt light headed and dizzy. i put the medicine down and told the other nurses what happened. i was helped to the sink to rinse my hand and then sat down. by this time my heart rate was high and i was having a hard time talking and breathing. another nurse came in and checked my pupils and tried to stand me up to go get checked out and my legs wouldn't work. i was lifted in to a wheelchair and taken to a room. the cna placed me on the heart monitor and blood pressure machine, my heart rate was in the 60s which was low for me after a 12 hour shift, and my blood pressure was 90/48. i started to feel better in about 10 minutes although my heart rate was irregular. the doctor came in and said that it can be absorbed through the skin, something no one seemed to be sure of at first because not many are as skilled as me and get it on their skin. after being monitored for an hour or so and plenty of people laughing at my mistake once i was ok i could finally head home. i will now be wearing gloves when drawing up all meds from now on.

    Here is the article: this f-up didn't happen today, but few months back. but i can still remember it. okay, so my family decided to house this kid. we thought it would be a great idea since we needed the money (his parents paid us to house him) and thought he was a decent kid. now that i think about it, that was the worst decision my family made. 

first, the kid began to take control of the internet. since we're not that bright at computers (only my older brother was), we literally just watched as he brought havoc into the servers. we got him under control by placing the router in a place where he couldn't reach, but he began plotting (i think he was) the number of ways how to fuck with us. which brings to this event. 

i was working on my english essay, about 90% done. since i was almost done, i decided, "eh, why don't i celebrate with some games?" so i started playing. then my youngest brother asked if he can play the game i was playing. since i was in a good mood, i allowed him to use my computer while i went to the restroom. minutes later, i see that brat and my youngest brother arguing. and i see my fucking laptop. blank screen. 

see, that brat and my youngest brother had this argument going on for weeks, and usually the brat won (since he was older than my brother). then we would intervene and beat the crap out of that boy. since then, he's been annoying the hell out of my brother, and i think he literally sneaked behind my brother and pressed the power button. 

anyway, i rushed to my laptop, turned it on, and prayed to anything above the heavens that my document was auto-saved. and there is a reason why i don't trust the thing above the heavens. i find my essay gone. without any saves (i know it was stupid for me to not save while working, that's my f-up). 

and my essay was due tomorrow. 

next thing i know, i'm screaming at the fucking brat, trying to figure out if my fists can fit in his annoying ass. i dropped more f-bombs that day than i did with my entire life. while i am doing so, the kid looks calm as fuck. this enrages me more, but luckily my parents stopped me before i unleashed fury onto his sorry ass. after this, my parents come to a decision that we can't no longer house this brat, and he leaves the next week. oh, and he apparently "enjoyed his visit." 

motherfucker said he might come back and visit us during the summer. 

goddammit.

i was still tired when i woke up at 7am, but i forced myself to wake up. i quickly made cereal and brushed my teeth and got behind the tv. it was fun.

my mom and dad came home regular time and since their lunch break was four hours ago, they wanted to eat. when they opened the fridge, the milk had fallen on my mom's head. how could this happen? 

instead of putting the cereal box on top of the fridge, i unintentionally put the milk in its place. the milk was completely full and the heat spoiled it within the nine hours it was sitting there. knowing my mom, she'll probably break my xbox.

    Here is the article: couple days ago i ranted to one of my friends about this guy who was kind of annoying. let's call him mark. i had a close group of friends and a group chat, about 7 or 8 of us. mark was in that chat. yeah, i did say bad things behind his back and i acknowledge that was a big fuck up. i shouldn't have done that. anyway, the dude i ranted to (carl) told him about everything. then they told the rest of the group, but not in the chat, so i wouldn't know. i found out a day later when everyone started being hostile towards me. that's when i realized the huge mistake i made and apologized profusely to all of them, and some said they forgave me but it would seem that they made a new group without me in it and basically excluded me from the group. i decided to try again today and tried to clear everything up but, there were no results. if anything, they most likely hate me even more. two of them have blocked me and i doubt the other 4 or 5 of them will keep talking to me. keep in mind these were my closest friends. now, i'm lost. it's not easy to replace your like 8 closest friends. i acknowledge i fucked up big time and i hated myself for a long time thinking about it, and the only thing in the world that i want right now is to have my friends back, but i don't think that will ever happen. i know i should make new ones, but that's way easier said than done.

now for some reason i decided to have the gun out with me as we walk through the streets instead of in a bag, and i even walk with it as if i was in call of duty. we see my friend's dad driving over to us to pick us up, thinking they were gonna come to our house. then all of the sudden, cops pull us over. they tell us to drop our weapons, and threaten us. now being the 15 year old kid who's never been confronted by a cop, i get scared as hell. the cop said we were lucky he saw the orange part or he would have had to take out a real gun. so then more cop cars show up and inspect our guns, and even tell me to call my mom. i give the cop my phone and he talks with my mom, and accuses me of lying t my mom about what we were gonna do. i say "what?" and he says that i said we were just going to hang out at our house and i'm like "yeah... we changed plans when we left". at this point one of the cop cars come up, and i know one of the cops personally (father of a kid who used to go on my bus in middle school) and i'm a little calmer.
i tell them i just didn't think and i shoulda kept the guns in a bag, and they told me "yeah, this is frankly a pretty silly thing to do guys." so we apologize and the cops let us off with a warning. they tell us this stuff happens on the news and people get killed (i actuallly told him i wasn't so familiar with this kind of thing because i almost never see guys with pellet guns get killed by cops on news). mark, who is black, actually said (this made me chuckle a little) "i'm lucky, if it was just me with the gun they woulda shot me cause i'm black". i've actually never been so scared in my life, but at least my mom was calm, dad wasn't.

    Here is the article: begins with the obligatory tifu 'this actually happened three years ago'

i was off to my friend's house for the first time, and i didn't quite know where he lived. i didn't have my phone/any internet on me, so i was just relying on remembering the name of his flat/block thing. i was searching for his house for a while, so i ended up being fairly late, but i eventually found it, and it also turned out my mates went out the house searching for me since i was so late (keep in mind, no phone). so i walk up to the buzzers, really happy i found the house, and i begin mashing his door buzzer, but no one answers. i continue mashing, but i must have pressed the wrong button, and out of frustration for waiting outside for so long, after the person in the little speaker answered, i shouted 'open the frickin door', only to find a frustrated father come to the front of the flat, open the door, only to find me apologising for pressing the wrong button and telling him it was an accident. he lets me in, and the first sight i was greeted with was the entire family peeking out of their front door with concerned faces watch me go by and up the stairs.

final kick in the face, i knocked on my friends door, only to find out he isn't home, because he was out looking for me, so i end up awkwardly leaving the flat, only to see my friends shouting at me from across the road as i walk home

    Here is the summary: I visited my friend's house for the first time, but I didn't have my phone or any internet access, so I relied on memory to find the correct flat and ended up being late

i was off to my friend's house for the first time, and i didn't quite know where he lived. i didn't have my phone/any internet on me, so i was just relying on remembering the name of his flat/block thing. i was searching for his house for a while, so i ended up being fairly late, but i eventually found it, and it also turned out my mates went out the house searching for me since i was so late (keep in mind, no phone). so i walk up to the buzzers, really happy i found the house, and i begin mashing his door buzzer, but no one answers. i continue mashing, but i must have pressed the wrong button, and out of frustration for waiting outside for so long, after the person in the little speaker answered, i shouted 'open the frickin door', only to find a frustrated father come to the front of the flat, open the door, only to find me apologising for pressing the wrong button and telling him it was an accident. he lets me in, and the first sight i was greeted with was the entire family peeking out of their front door with concerned faces watch me go by and up the stairs.

final kick in the face, i knocked on my friends door, only to find out he isn't home, because he was out looking for me, so i end up awkwardly leaving the flat, only to see my friends shouting at me from across the road as i walk home

    Here is the summary: I went to my friend's house for the first time, but I didn't have my phone or any internet access, so I relied on memory to find the house and ended up being late

    Here is the article: so this did happen today.

i work in a stock room at a retail store and i was scheduled the day off today. when i woke up this morning i had the worst gas in my entire life, it was so bad i didn't even wanna leave the house.

i get a call at about noon and get guilt tripped into helping out since a lot of stuff hadn't been properly processed the night before. i felt bad so i decided to take some pepto and attempt not to gas the entire store.

well, i was busy putting out shoes onto the floor when this super old grandma takes a seat nearby, as i'm in front (i'd say two feet away) of her i feel the most enormous gurgle in my stomach.

i tried... i tried so hard not too but this fart was beastly and wasn't having none of it. long story short, it lets rip right in front of this sweet old ladies face causing her to practically shriek and get up and hustle, i could see her gagging the entire time until she was out of sight.

i went home pretty much immediately.

    Here is the summary: The author was scheduled to have the day off but was guilt-tripped into helping out at the retail store due to unfinished tasks from the previous night

    Here is the article: obviously not today. its been more than a month now. 

time : when its too early for lunch and too late for a snack before lunch. 
day : conditional bad day. 
place: i might have fucked up but i am not stupid to out myself like this. 
situation of the pants: mostly dry

it was like any other day. i got up way too late in the morning debated breakfast and skipped it anyways. and drove to work mins before my manager and acted like i have been at the desk for more time than i was. just as he passed my desk i said to myself out loud " ok time for the coffee" and went into the kitchen grabbed that cheap styrofoam cup and poured a drink for myself. walked down to the second floor to have a smoke and coffee. 

since it was still cold back then i didnt stay outside for long and walked inside with the coffee cup minus the cigarette. i get a call on my phone and check its from my mom ( from india, yes i am indian my username is relevant). so asusual i end the incoming call and dial back and started talking. 

while still on the call with my mom and strolling in the second floor i come across this "pull lever incase of fire" lever. i have the phone in one hand glued to my ear. and with the free hand i was running my hands across the lever,  i know very stupid thing to do but i wasnt applying any sort of pressure. all i did was run my hands on the lever like they do with smooth skin chicks in commercials. and all of a sudden the lever drops and inch. ear blaring high pitched sounds and alarms. 

situation in pants : smaller and moist than usual. 

my heart was racing like a horse. i didnt know what to do. millions of thoughts were crossing my mind. even before i could pull the lever back or do something about it everybody from the office were running out. at this point i wanted to collapse to the ground and act like i had seizures but the clothes were new and i didnt know if it will be a dead giveaway that i pulled the lever. so i postponed that thought and acted like i didnt know what happened and walked to the front of the building. all the c level guys were out too along with my manager his boss and the directors with in couple minutes there were two fire trucks and an ambulance. 

situation in pants: ley me put it this way if i was in california they would have granted me citizenship for my supply of water to the state.

after pissing my pants metaphorically, for the fear of getting caught and losing the job and getting deported and put in prison and what not i saw a familiar face in the crow. i went to a friend of mine and all the while still talking to my mom and giving her all the information first hand and freaking her out, i asked my friend using my hand gesture of "dude what happened" and he responded with i dont know gesture. 

at this point my mom told my dad that i somehow started a fire in the office and it is on fire and fire truck is here to rescue the people in the office. my dad was shocked and started calling me names and what not was reminding me of all the fuck ups i ever did since being a kid. and it was hard for me to concentrate here at the situation and also explain what was happening to my hyper dad. so i told them i will call back in 5 and hung up.  no this is not the fuck up, atleast not the end of it. 

i somehow managed to tell that friend of mine that i was the one who started the alarm and i dont know what to do and i was freaking out. he had an interesting expression on his face and then proceeded to ask me where exactly did i pull the lever. i said in the second floor. and then he said dude we dont have cameras in the second floor so you are in luck they wont be able to tell who did it. it hit me like a cool breeze in a hot indian summer. 

situation in pants : well not as wet but i am sure my heart sank into my ball sack and still was pretty much beating at a pace which i didnt appreciate.


now that the alarm was reset and everybody went back to their work i leaned across the wall of the second floor entrance and started smoking another cigarette. i was telling my dad over the phone now  how it is very common here in the united states for people to freak out about small stuff and make a big deal out of it and how i was able to cleverly escape from such a situation so he wont lecture me about it. only to find out my manager listening to everything i say standing beside me. he said "if you were not a critical resource i would hand your ass to them, dont ever repeat this again knowingly or otherwise" .

    Here is the summary: The protagonist accidentally pulls the "pull lever in case of fire" lever in their office building, setting off the fire alarm and causing panic

    Here is the article: back-story. although, i'll preface this with the simple statement that yes; i'm an ass. not all of the time - well, not even most of the time... my job requires a lot of responsibility - and i've got a solid 3 months of 24/7 work coming up. in other words, the next few weeks are my time to fuck off...

 

my girlfriend lives in a modest apartment with a roommate. roommate is out of town for a couple of months. therefore, i don't feel odd when i use her/their shower. starting around the time that she (roommate) left, there was a clear, relatively hard plastic ring sitting innocuously on a shelf in the shower. i'm a technical person - i found the fact that i didn't know what this "thing" was to be frustrating. yes, really. this quandary went on for about 2 weeks every time i took a shower. initial thought was that it was a bracelet. but: the fact that it was made of hard, non-stretchy material soon eliminated that possibility, (unless the wearer had midget-wrists). hair scrunchy. nope. 

i'd sworn it off. 

until last night. 

laying in bed; turning over to my sweetheart, "hey, what's that thing in the shower? you know, that hard plastic ring..". 

to which she quickly responded: "it's a nuva ring." 

my response was somewhat of a paradox. intrigued that my 2 week long internal quest for knowledge had possibly reached a conclusion, yet absolutely disgusted that i had attempted to put another women's birth control on my wrist like a bracelet, attempted to stretch it and held it up to my face to investigate it... 

google was queried, and a spat of photos confirmed what it was. 

but that wasn't enough. 

leaping out of bed and running to the shower, proclaiming - "i'll show you what it is!"

trying to be funny, tossing it in the air unto my wonderful girlfriend who was laying in bed - thinking that it would land gracefully upon her blanket-covered chest, then she'd laugh - think it was funny, confirm what it was and then go to sleep next to me. 

basically, this is one of those things where you're trying to convince yourself that one of the outcomes will be great, and the other one will be shit. when, in reality both of them are equally shitty...

i overshot my throw.

the nuva ring hit her square in the nose, then bounced off her forehead - and landed next to her in bed. not good. 

to which she loudly screamed, "you're a fucking asshole! that's gross!"

meekly, i responded, "well, i didn't mean to do it..."

more angry comments regarding having another women's birth control thrown at her face while laying in bed ensued - to which i really had no real counterpoint to - then it transgressed into respect, maturity, etc. 

i slept on the couch last night. 

tl;dr threw birth control at my girlfriend and she became incredibly upset...

    Here is the article: let me just begin by explaining that i am normally unable to survive an entire day without napping at least an hour.

my church had this collaboration with other bp churches across singapore to celebrate the 500th anniversary of the protestant reformation and it was a pretty big event. i volunteered to play in the ensemble for the event, which consisted of various musicians from all the churches. for this event, i had to wake up pretty early (i still have a bit of memory loss so i don't remember exactly when but i think it was 7am, which i am not used to because i normally wake up a lot later) and it was really hectic. anyway i had a lot of fun during the event, it was really awesome and informative, and i would totally go again. except that it was also quite exhausting, and i collapsed into a long and deep nap when i reached home at about 4pm. 

since it's also national day for singapore, everyone in my family had gone to my aunt's house to watch the parade live on tv, as is the custom. i stayed at home to nap because i didn't have the energy to leave my bed. later on i woke up and it was 9pm, so i checked my phone and browsed instagram for a bit.

that was the last thing i remember doing. next thing i knew, i was lying down on my bed and my parents were frantically shaking me awake and calling my name repeatedly. i woke up confused and asked what happened. 

apparently earlier on when they returned back home, my younger brother came to my room to talk to me and he noticed that i was sleeping with my eyes open. i was sitting propped up against the bedroom wall and staring into space blankly, with saliva forming bubbles at the corner of my mouth. i was also apparently sleep talking gibberish, which prompted him to call my mom down. she saw me and started panicking because of the saliva bubbles - it could have meant that i was having a fit. but after checking that it wasn't the normal foaming, she was more relieved and then tried shaking me to wake me up, but it didn't work so she called my dad down as well. my dad came and first adjusted my body to lie down full length on the bed, and then jabbed my sides. hard. i should probably mention at this point that i am extremely ticklish, so that did the trick and i finally woke up. but i had memory loss and it took a while to piece my life back together - i didn't even remember my own name at first. fml.

    Here is the summary: You woke up after a long and deep nap at 9pm, having slept for around 12 hours, and had memory loss of the events that had occurred earlier in the day
    


    You will be given one summary written for a news article. Your task is to rate the summary based on the following criteria:
    Output format: PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE

    Evaluation Criteria:
    1. Read the news article carefully and identify the main topic and key points.
    2. Read the summary and compare it to the news article. Check if the summary covers the main topic and key points of the news article, and if it resents them in a clear and logical order.

    Here is the article: let me just begin by explaining that i am normally unable to survive an entire day without napping at least an hour.

my church had this collaboration with other bp churches across singapore to celebrate the 500th anniversary of the protestant reformation and it was a pretty big event. i volunteered to play in the ensemble for the event, which consisted of various musicians from all the churches. for this event, i had to wake up pretty early (i still have a bit of memory loss so i don't remember exactly when but i think it was 7am, which i am not used to because i normally wake up a lot later) and it was really hectic. anyway i had a lot of fun during the event, it was really awesome and informative, and i would totally go again. except that it was also quite exhausting, and i collapsed into a long and deep nap when i reached home at about 4pm. 

since it's also national day for singapore, everyone in my family had gone to my aunt's house to watch the parade live on tv, as is the custom. i stayed at home to nap because i didn't have the energy to leave my bed. later on i woke up and it was 9pm, so i checked my phone and browsed instagram for a bit.

that was the last thing i remember doing. next thing i knew, i was lying down on my bed and my parents were frantically shaking me awake and calling my name repeatedly. i woke up confused and asked what happened. 

apparently earlier on when they returned back home, my younger brother came to my room to talk to me and he noticed that i was sleeping with my eyes open. i was sitting propped up against the bedroom wall and staring into space blankly, with saliva forming bubbles at the corner of my mouth. i was also apparently sleep talking gibberish, which prompted him to call my mom down. she saw me and started panicking because of the saliva bubbles - it could have meant that i was having a fit. but after checking that it wasn't the normal foaming, she was more relieved and then tried shaking me to wake me up, but it didn't work so she called my dad down as well. my dad came and first adjusted my body to lie down full length on the bed, and then jabbed my sides. hard. i should probably mention at this point that i am extremely ticklish, so that did the trick and i finally woke up. but i had memory loss and it took a while to piece my life back together - i didn't even remember my own name at first. fml.

    Here is the summary: I woke up confused and disoriented after a long and restorative nap following a church event, with no memory of what happened after the event and before falling asleep

    Here is the article: first off... i am 16 and have been depressed since i-can't-remember-when, this has made me quite cynical, pessimistic and all around miserable. i've never gotten professional help other than a single visit to a psychologist who hinted i was depressed, though this was a long time ago and it has gotten worse to the point where even an idiot would come to the conclusion that i was depressed.so far, the only person i've told this is a used-to-be-close friend of mine, and that was because she nagged me until i told her what was wrong.at first she didn't know how to react and tried to awkwardly cheer me up by saying such things as "you shouldn't feel this way" and "you have a good life", etc. many times i tried to explain that this wasn't me not wanting to find joy in life, and that it was me being physically unable to do so, but she kept insisting that i being too negative. either way, having someone to support me made me feel like i could crawl my way out of this hole i had been living in.time went by and on valentine's day, she confessed having feelings for me... she knew about how i felt for her, so we ended up in a strange situation where she was my best friend who acted like my girlfriend in secret and was also a sort of my therapist, this didn't last much... eventually she confessed she didn't really have such strong feelings for me and that she'd been acting like that in order to cheer me up. this revelation crushed me due to some past events that i won't be discussing right now. but on the bright side, she also said that she actually grew fond of me to the point were no acting was needed anymore, so we continued our "relationship" until yesterday.after putting up with me during many of my ups and downs, she grew tired of it and decided to give up. she gave me a lengthy rant about how tired she was of my negative attitude and cynicism, how tired she was of trying to help me change only for me to have another episode. her final words were basically "talk to me when you're feeling better, and if you never do, then never talk to me again".so...

    Here is the article: this was actually exactly 14 month ago today.
i was her trauzeugin="wedding witness" (it's similar to maid of honor, but in addition to help planning and make everything go as smoothly as possible there's also a legal part to it. you have to sign the marriage papers too.)

also the wedding was held in the primary official residence of the president... soo kinda high on security stuff. every guest has to be on the list and checked for terrorist ties and so on 2 month before the event and has to specify what legal document they are going to use to identify themselves.

so the night before the big day i try to organize everything (because we'll have to catch the train at 5 in the morning and my adhd can be an asshole) i put my passport and my boyfriend(at the time)s id into his tuxedo jacket and tell him where they are. 

next morning: get up at 4, get ready, my boyfriend realizes his nice shoes are covered in tar (from his last fuck up..storry for another time) and he's already left black spots all over the apartment. i don't live alone and won't be back for another week, so i can't just leave it like that. i steal nail polish remover from my flatmate and scrub the floors as good as i can before we run to the train station. (taking the nail polish remover with me, so bf can work on cleaning his shoes on the way. so he won't stain the presidents rugs.) we get the train just in time and fall into the seats. i reach for the nail polish remover and realize that a good portion of it has been spilled on my dress and it didn't like that. it now has some slightly lighter spots and my arm is green. (luckily i was wearing black tights, because as i realized later my knees were green too)
we finally arrive at my best friends house, help her get dressed and ready. the shoes are pretty much tarless and my arm mostly flesh colored again. we're about to leave but as adrenalin levels normalize my boyfriend realizes, that in the chaos this morning running to the train he'd grabbed the wrong jacket! he still had some kind of valid id on him, but not the one he had told the security before. i however had none. (except a student id, which is not at all a legal document and very easily forged) 

so i could have easily not just failed to be at my best friends wedding, but stopped it from happening all together, since my signature was needed for the paperwork. 
however, i talked my way through security. begged the marriage officiator, and everything worked out fine.
tho i really don't know how she can still be friends with me or trust me with anything.
as a trauzeugin you're supposed to keep all stress away from the bride, but i just caused all the stress instead.


 
a) get to a high security region
b) be allowed to sign the marriage paper (without the signature the wedding would not have taken place) 
and as an added bonus i spilled nail polish remover over my dress, which made it loose it's color and stain me.

edit: typos

    Here is the summary: The author was a trauzeugin (similar to a maid of honor) for their best friend's wedding, which took place in a high-security region, and they had to sign the marriage papers to make the wedding legal

    Here is the article: i'm currently on a two week vacation from my home in california to visit my girlfriend where she lives in oslo norway. i usually reside somewhere near the bottom of the barrel of budget travelers so i thought it’d be a really nice gesture to turn over a new leaf and surprise her by having a fancy airbnb arranged in advance. my gesture was met with the predicted response and we were on our way to having a great vacation. turns out that the flat that we rented is actually just the second story of the hosts house with only a short set of stairs separating the two floors. wasn't a problem. the host also has a dog. to some, learning that your fancy two week rental is shared with a snorting(at no fault of its own), shedding pug would be a cause for concern. my girlfriend and i are both dog lovers so we actually regarded the news of our furry roommate as a positive even upon learning that the pug would be waking us up at 6 am every morning scratching at our door. the first two nights we were here we had dinner with the host and got along fine. i didn't pay much attention to the dog for the first two days because we were out being tourists and came back late both nights. the third day we were here, it was rainy and grey so we decided to stay in and have a reading day. halfway through our reading day i was feeling a little restless so i thought i’d try to bond with the dog a bit. i got on all fours and initiated a dog game i’ve procured over the years which is a mixture of “hide and seek” and “tag” with elements of “peek a boo” conservatively peppered in. the dog, who was obviously used to domestic pampered apartment life, despite being tentative at first, took to my game like a caged horse takes to the hills. in other words, he loved it. he got so engrossed in the game that after no more than ten minutes, my girlfriend got annoyed and told me i should tone it down. i agreed and complied with her request and proceeded to chill out. problem was, the dog was acting like he had finally found himself and wasn't into chilling out. his spirit was finally unleashed and he was making it known. he was howling, licking, tail wagging, running laps around the living room and barking. he seemed as though he had finally broken free from the burden that the genetic baggage from hundreds of generations of forced selective breeding at the hands of humans had left him with. it was right about that time that the host walked in the door from work. he was instantly visibly alarmed at the state in which his lapdog was behaving. he kept repeating the statement “this is extremely strange, i have never even heard him bark before”. after much deliberation and assessing the situation, he came to the conclusion that the only explanation is that dog must have been abused somehow. i tried to explain to him exactly what happened, but he’s not buying it. i went upstairs and continued to hear barking for the next hour while simultaneously being lectured by my girlfriend about respect and how to properly behave in other peoples homes. now when i pass the host in the hallway he treats me like an animal abuser and my girlfriend is mad that i made the living situation uncomfortable through my “immaturity”. the dog has calmed down for the most part but has retained his newfound love of barking and i finally know what it feels like to be a criminal.

    Here is the article: i've been working a security system sales job for a few months now. pretty shitty job, knockng on doors, cold-calliing, and after today i'm thinking about quitting. attending chamber of commerce roundtables has been quite tedious with no payoff because i haven't been able to hand out business cards. today was my fifth meeting, the first day i was allowed to hand out my cards to the prominent business members of the community. there were about 30 business representatives at today's meeting, including one really pretty woman who works at a flower shop. anyway, i just recently had my cards made. finally something permanent. no more generic cards where i would have to pen in my name and number. i was so happy and proud handing a thick stack of cards to the person next to me, watching the stack make its way around the room, knowing sales would result from my months of networking. so the cards make their way around the room and everyone has one. as the meeting proceeds, i zone out, waiting for my turn to talk. i flip a fresh business card around a few times (i can't currently afford a fidget spinner to quell my add). the card lands on the ground after a couple of spins and i go to reach for it but as i take a closer look at it there is a sinking feeling in my stomach. i done fucked up. right below my name is the wrong number... and it's my mom's. wtf?? turns out that when i submitted my paperwork to the company to make my business cards i accidently submitted my mom's cell number instead of mine. i shamefully admitted how much of a dumbass i was to the chamber and later my boss wasn pissed that 1000 new cards had been ordered all fucked up. my mom received several phone calls throughout the day... all looking for samehereagain (which i don't get because i told those bastards it was my mommy's number).

    Here is the summary: After months of struggling with a security system sales job, including attending tedious chamber of commerce roundtables, I finally had the chance to hand out my new business cards, but I made a crucial mistake: I accidentally included my mom's cell number instead of my own

    Here is the article: as per usual, didn't occur today, happened quite some time ago.

so i used to be a long distance runner in quite a serious way, would regularly clock 200+ kilometres a week. loved running trails out in the bush but occasionally i would hit the gym at off peak times and spend a couple of hours training on the treadmill.


so there i was, happily running away on the treadmill in what, after a quick glance around, i thought was a deserted gym when i started getting some stomach cramps which i knew was just bad gas. the gym being empty (i thought) i was just letting the gas do it's thing and unleashing these extremely satisfying, big hearty farts.


one of these had a bit of a surprise with it - a nice little hard turd nugget which kind of caught up in the mesh lining of my running shorts. i never knew it was a turd nug straight away, i just felt something weird bouncing around in my shorts, so a quick adjust down below and i see this almost perfectly round bit of hard poo fall onto the treadmill belt and fly off the end.


naturally, i jumped off to catch the offender cause i'm really not "that" much of a dirty bastard. lo and behold - there is a middle age woman pretty much directly behind me on the other side of the room stretching on a yoga mat - about 2 metres from where my little surprise came to rest.


she looked both surprised and embarrassed, but i guess she had been there for some time, listening to my farts and trying to catch poo balls. i'm sure she had a good laugh at my expense. i picked it up with my bare hands, got my gear and left without saying a word.....

one of the many possible side effects is of course diarrhoea...

well, 4 days into drinking this stuff i'm thinking screw you side effects, i'm clearly a machine!

15 minutes ago i felt the urge to fart...having my own room this isn't an issue regardless of noise disturbance so i work away...only...it wasn't a fart...it was a full on nappy filling shart...

panic stations...the closest toilet to me is being cleaned...i have to waddle down to the shared bathroom and thank god its empty!

my underwear can't be saved...worse still my trousers aren't looking the prettiest...all i can say is i'm lucky my favourite colour is blue..

i cleaned up as best i could...hide the underwear in an empty sweet box from christmas (please let me remember to bring that home) and headed to the now clean upstairs toilet to dry everything off...

baby wipes are in short supply at work so screen wipes to the rescue....i'm now hoping i can sit at my desk for the rest of the afternoon until i can sneak off home!!

    Here is the article: i live in miami, and was planning to go to the beach today, but instead i'm spending my afternoon sitting on a cold can of ginger ale. why you ask? here we go...

so the semester has just started and i haven't fully restocked all of my bathroom supplies. if i wanted to go to the beach, i needed to clean up my bikini line, but i forgot to pick up a critical pack of disposable razors. "it's okay" i think. "my old roommate left behind nair" 

for those of you who don't know what nair is, it's a thick chemical cream that literally dissolves the hair off your body. it has a super high ph and has warnings on the bottle about how not to use on sensitive skin. well, i really wanted to go to the beach. how bad could it be? i just needed to be careful with my application. 

so i slathered myself (carefully) in this "cherry blossom scented" calcium hydroxide solution. you're supposed to let it sit for about 5-7 minutes, and i could feel the cream getting warmer as it went about it's merry hair-dissolving business. it stung a bit, but i could handle it. until i realized i needed to pee. 

so make my way to the toilet, and i start to pee, when a searing pain explodes in my crotch. psych -- the pee spread chemicals way down into my nether regions, and i was in agony. boys, this was like pouring boiling water directly onto your dick. i'm yelling, i'm peeing on the floor as i run to the shower, i jump in the shower and start rinsing with water like my life depended on it. at this point, i was in so much pain, my life did depend on it. 

remember that scene from fight club where tyler durden puts lye on the back of the main character's hand? and vinegar would neutralize the burn but water makes it worse? bingo. same situation. i'm in the shower, dousing myself in hot water, and it keeps. getting. worse. i'm screaming, there's pubic hair everywhere, my crotch is on fire, and i haven't realized the chemicals are too strong to be neutralized by water. it was like someone took a branding iron and just shoved it up there. i would have tried to amputate if you could amputate an internal structure.

eventually something clicks, and i remember that leave-in hair products tend to be acidic. i grab my hair gel (contains phosphoric acid) and neutralize the nair as best i can. after a bit, sweet relief (sorta) washes over me. i rinsed, got out of the shower, and assessed the damage. not good. everything was swollen, deep red, and still felt like it was burning, but not as intensely. i started scouring my room; ice packs? no. but cans of soda? close enough. i've been sitting on a can of ginger ale for half an hour, and it's no longer cold enough to make the burning go away. time to switch it out for a fanta.

the beach is long out of the question. there's just no way.

    Here is the article: a few weeks ago i had a house warming party with about 15 of my mates and my so. after many consecutive hours of drinking i was in my bedroom and saw my so in my bathroom. 


me being the charming casanova i am, i grabbed her and threw her onto the bed (that concluded foreplay) dropped my pants to my ankles and lined up my built in missile for its target. 


bang. straight in, initially i remember thinking something didn't feel right but i was committed to the cause and didn't want to leave the job unfinished. 


more discomfort followed as the party went on through the house but i paid it off because i was too drunk. 


time to change up the positions, i notice a little bit of blood. all good, i've ran the red river before and i'm not afraid to do it again and eventually i pulled out and had a look. 


holy mother of god. 


from my belly button down looked like a murder scene and the look on my so's face lead me to believe it was. frantic cleaning ensued as i'm doing everything i can to calm my red lightsaber down and inspect the damage. my so is upset and crying thinking it is her blood and i'm trying to make everything good again so i put my pants on, hide my blood soaked hawaii t shirt and get another beer.

    Here is the article: a few weeks ago i had a house warming party with about 15 of my mates and my so. after many consecutive hours of drinking i was in my bedroom and saw my so in my bathroom. 


me being the charming casanova i am, i grabbed her and threw her onto the bed (that concluded foreplay) dropped my pants to my ankles and lined up my built in missile for its target. 


bang. straight in, initially i remember thinking something didn't feel right but i was committed to the cause and didn't want to leave the job unfinished. 


more discomfort followed as the party went on through the house but i paid it off because i was too drunk. 


time to change up the positions, i notice a little bit of blood. all good, i've ran the red river before and i'm not afraid to do it again and eventually i pulled out and had a look. 


holy mother of god. 


from my belly button down looked like a murder scene and the look on my so's face lead me to believe it was. frantic cleaning ensued as i'm doing everything i can to calm my red lightsaber down and inspect the damage. my so is upset and crying thinking it is her blood and i'm trying to make everything good again so i put my pants on, hide my blood soaked hawaii t shirt and get another beer.

    Here is the article: so i am a middle school teacher that has had a very nasty head cold recently. i was rushing out the door yesterday and thought i would have a quick 1 minute breakfast of a muffin and what i thought was cranberry juice. in my haste i did not read the label of the juice bottle in the fridge and just threw it right down the hatch. with the head cold, i did not notice any major taste difference. 
**flash forward one hour**
by the time first period hit, i was feeling a bit queasy as i have never drank prune juice before. i thought perhaps my breakfast of four coffees and a muffin made my stomach feel upset so i did not think much about it. however i thought it was just a little gas and i decided to let out a little steam during locker break....it..was..not..gas. an explosion of ungodliness came out and i had to literally walk out of class...luckily a spare change of pants and a box of wet paper towels in my back seat came to the rescue...but my god...the horror that was in those pants.

    Here is the article: i usually avoid changing in gym locker rooms. it's not a body image thing, i just don't usually have any time constraints or motivations that would require anything other than waiting until i got home to shower and change.

today, though, i got lazy and decided to just change there. i didn't feel like putting a towel down on the car seat, okay? 

so i chose the farthest set of lockers because it was deserted (because the last thing you want to do is have to sidle past a fellow athlete and have jingles be jangled and what not) and i disrobed, showered, and got back to my locker promptly, towel wrapped around my waist.

so as i returned to my locker, a group of 6-8 year olds followed by one supervising adult came into my locker nook right behind me, because apparently that is where they had set up shop before their pool trip. the adult received a phone call and wandered over to the sinks, partially out of sight. the kids ripped off their swimsuits in exchange for their birthday suits and started cartwheeling around the u shaped locker nook. i tried to ignore them as i opened my locker and organized my belongings. but i heard them murmuring behind me.

"heheheh, i can see your wee wee!"
"ha! i can see your wee wee!"
*giggles*
they were being kids, sure, but it was a creepy conversation to be privy to as it is. but it got weird when the turned their attention to me.

"can ya see the big person's wee wee?"
"i don't know, i don't, i don't think so"

this was making me even more uncomfortable. then one of them snuck up behind me and ripped off my towel. the bugger absconded with my towel and started doing his best hare krishna impression. 

but i ignored them because no way was i going to chase children around until i at least had my shorts on. but i couldn't find them. they were buried somewhere in my locker and i cursed my lack of organization in putting them away. they continued murmuring.

"gasp! they look like ... potatoes!"
"big potatoes!"

forget uncomfortable. it was like 9th grade all over again. i'd have preferred a swirly. even a chunky dunk. especially after the last kid spoke up.

"... heheh mashed potatoes!!!! ahahahahahah!!!!"

and the smallest one (still buck naked, mind you), got on the bench and charged at me, leaping in the air towards me. considering he just implied he was gonna do some serious damage to my potatoes, i felt like i had no choice but to catch him and hold him as far away from my potatoes as possible. he started thrashing around like i was playing a game of sega human fishing, and i tried my best to hold him as far from me as possible. the other kids, in various forms of undress, kept giggling, pointing at my kibbles and bits.

it was awful.

this is, of course, when their adult comes back around and finds me butt naked, holding one of his children, the rest of them gathered around me. the one in my hands squirms out of my grasp and runs towards the guy. the guy just mouths a sorry and corrals them together towards the showers. 

i just stood there. ashamed. broken. 

i found my boxers rolled up in my work shoes. 


 

edit: dang it, i'm on the front page. i guess i should be thankful. thank you, ladies ad gents, for making my potatoes famous. good health to all of you!

    Here is the summary: The author describes an embarrassing experience at a gym locker room where a group of 6-8 year old children saw them naked and made fun of their body, calling them "mashed potatoes

    Here is the article: this tifu is currently still in progress - so very fresh! today (wednesday) is my "friday" as i'm going on vacation thursday and (the real) friday. 

feeling adventurous, i decided to ride my motorcycle to work this morning. it's far and it was cold but i love riding it! so, i swathed myself in all of my finest dead cow accouterments and headed out the door. had a great ride in, got the cool wind in my face, didn't get ran over. awesome.

get to work, put the bike key in the pocket of my leather pants, come in, slave away for 9 hours (ended up having to stay late on account of an unexpected conference call). 

by this time it's already 5 and i'm ready to go. beyond ready - vacation started an hour ago! earlier in the day, i'd noticed a "found lost key, come to suite # to pick up". thought nothing of it. now that i'm all suited up and antsy to get the hell out of town, i start looking for my key. under every desk, the copier, in the trash can, the fridge... everywhere. no key. the idiot who dropped the key was me. me. me, who has been desperately trying to leave on their first vacation in over a year for an hour now. 

i think okay! not that bad, obviously someone found it and it's just over in suite #. i trot eagerly down there, with a sense of relief, until i pull on the door. that conference call i got stuck on that kept me until 5? well, that put me right outside of their business hours. door is locked and i'm just standing there with my dick in my hand (i'm a girl but there's not really a vagina equivalent of this statement) wondering how the fuck i'm going to get out of this one. 

so, here i sit.... still at work at 6pm, still in full leathers, waiting for someone to come by with the spare so that the bike doesn't sit in the parking lot here for another 4 days. wrote a note and left it under the door of the business hoping they will release the key to my boss, to whom i also gave a copy of the same note.

    Here is the article: very short story here (so short, in fact, that i had to resubmit it. here's hoping, because i'm not counting on mobile.) spent 3 days sheltered down inland with my girlfriend's family to ride out irma. this morning we packed all our bags to head home after a quick trip out and back to assess the damage. no damage to our place. no damage to gf's parent's place. lost power for less than 24 hours at gf's sister's house. all in all, a very successful first hurricane for me. 

on the way out, asshole me and my whole 3 weeks of garimot training, i gave a good swift kick to the punching bag hanging in gf's sister's garage forgetting both that i don't know how to deliver a proper kick and that i was doing so in my sandals. a solid kick with my ankle making direct contact at full force later, and i'm walking with a slight limp, but got shit to do so mostly ignore it. 

it's been a few hours now and the pain has slowly but steadily increased to the point where walking on it is no longer bearable. now i'm just trying to figure out if it's worth it to even try and find an open urgent care yet. anyone in south broward got any suggestions?

    Here is the article: this didn't happen today, it happened around st. patrick's day. my boyfriend and i are both in college, and i wanted him to stay the night. he had a social thing that evening, and i wasn't sure if i'd be awake when he got back, so i left my dorm room door unlocked for him (which i've done in the past). a few hours later, he came in slightly drunk, got in bed, and we went to sleep. 

fast forward to 5 am. i'm a light sleeper, and i woke up to what i thought was my boyfriend getting back in bed. he was curled up at the end, which i thought was kinda weird, and kept trying to steal the covers, which annoyed me. i was pretty sleepy and confused at this point, but it didn't take long to realize my boyfriend was still peacefully asleep next to me. 

there was someone else in the bed with us. 

i freaked the fuck out, woke my boyfriend, and started whispering that there was a guy in bed with us. it took him about 5 minutes of groggily staring at the lump under the covers for the light bulb to click. 

turns out, it was my incredibly drunk neighbor who confused my room as his own when he got locked out of his. he was only in his underwear, so we had to give him clothes and shoes to go get the lock out key. i ran into him once afterwards, and he couldn't remember anything other than that he accidentally went into my room. 

the whole thing was weird, but we laugh about it now.

    Here is the summary: My boyfriend and I were in college, and I left my dorm room door unlocked for him to stay the night, but we woke up to find an intoxicated neighbor in bed with us, who had mistakenly entered my room thinking it was his own

For example, if you think the summary is 80% likely to get a score of 5, 10% likely to get a score of 4, 5% likely to get a score of 3, 3% likely to get a score of 2, and 1% likely to get a score of 1, you should rate the summary as 80, 10, 5, 3, 2.

    Here is the article: this didn't happen today, it happened around st. patrick's day. my boyfriend and i are both in college, and i wanted him to stay the night. he had a social thing that evening, and i wasn't sure if i'd be awake when he got back, so i left my dorm room door unlocked for him (which i've done in the past). a few hours later, he came in slightly drunk, got in bed, and we went to sleep. 

fast forward to 5 am. i'm a light sleeper, and i woke up to what i thought was my boyfriend getting back in bed. he was curled up at the end, which i thought was kinda weird, and kept trying to steal the covers, which annoyed me. i was pretty sleepy and confused at this point, but it didn't take long to realize my boyfriend was still peacefully asleep next to me. 

there was someone else in the bed with us. 

i freaked the fuck out, woke my boyfriend, and started whispering that there was a guy in bed with us. it took him about 5 minutes of groggily staring at the lump under the covers for the light bulb to click. 

turns out, it was my incredibly drunk neighbor who confused my room as his own when he got locked out of his. he was only in his underwear, so we had to give him clothes and shoes to go get the lock out key. i ran into him once afterwards, and he couldn't remember anything other than that he accidentally went into my room. 

the whole thing was weird, but we laugh about it now.

    Here is the article: this was about a week ago. my boyfriend was leaving for the military so we were spending as much time as possible together at a friend's place. this had become a daily thing for the past 2 weeks, so i had become pretty comfortable with going and sleeping on the couch while they continued drinking or playing video games. also, side note, my boyfriend and his friend still devoutly believe "girls don't fart". i've always lived up to this, because i think it'd be awkward and unattractive to do in front of people other than my family, but i digress.
so i pass out on the couch, and i vaguely remember waking up a few times and talking to them. one of the times, i was scooting down so his friend could sit on the couch. i remember saying something, and he responded with "but girls don't fart!" i remember laughing, farting, and falling back asleep while they all laughed too. if i was awake, this totally wouldn't have been something i'd do but.. i can't remember if it really happened or if it was a dream. i also remember waking up later, and crawling back up on the couch to my original spot when my boyfriend was wanting to crash, so i know i moved down for his friend..
the following morning, i wake up, extremely confused wondering if it really happened or was a dream. my boyfriend wakes up and looks at me with this slight smile, and then proceeds to tell me how much he loves me. it seemed really random from him.. it might be because he thought it was funny, or it might have been because it was one of our last few days together. i'm too afraid to find out which, but it haunts me.

    Here is the article: in my audio class, i sit next to this nice japanese exchange student. she obviously understands the audio editing software we use better than i do and helps me if i get snagged on anything and is a big help whenever i need it. obviously, she isn't fully aware of some american lingo and if she's unclear on a word or phrase the professor just said, she'll ask me or the person to the other side of her what was just said and it happens quite frequently because he's one of those professors who will curse and use vulgar terms and doesn't give a damn if we do or not.  
today, we were all brainstorming about topics we should interview people about on campus, which eventually lead to alcohol abuse, binge drinking, and the other normal shit you'd immediately expect of a college class. one student brings up the existence of powdered alcohol and we all go on a tangent about that for a while. after we all decide it's a dumb way of ingesting alcohol, i end it with "i think i'll just stick to butt chugging".  

we all laugh and jubilate about that for a while, so naturally, the sweet japanese girl wants to know what butt chugging is, so she asks me. i freeze up, because how in the hell do you look someone so innocent and dying to learn what was so funny to the rest of the class in the eyes and explain what butt chugging is.  

eventually, the first thing that came to my head, which was "ask the professor" came out of my mouth (which thank god she didn't do, that would have made me feel like i was making a display out of her). instead she pulls up google translate and decides to find out for herself. it takes every bit of my humanity to not laugh like a fucking maniac when she types "butt chugging" into the search bar over and over in different sites, becoming more frustrated as time went on.  

eventually, she must've found what she was looking for, because her eyes widen, she let's out kind of an "uwaaa" and her face reddens as she gives me a look that makes me almost bite my fucking tongue off in an effort to not scream in laughter while the lecture was going on. but, great. now she thinks i consume alcohol through my bumhole.

    Here is the article: weird title, huh?

here's the story.

my friend, let's call him elmer, is a vet at a brazilian wildlife rescue in sao paolo. he recently invited me down to meet him for a week's worth of all sao paolo has to offer, so i said fuck it, grabbed my wallet and keys, and flew down to meet him. 

when we got there we left the airport, and following was four days sao paolo clubs, expensive alcohol, cognac cigars, and even a yacht party!
met celebrities, models, even some politicians, of both the underground hierarchy and the surface government. it was an amazing experience. and, with the combined hangover that results from 4 days of south american partying, i also experienced what it is like to jackhammer your temples.

elmer and i decided to stop partying for a day, for fear that the combined alcohol content in our blood would ignite the next time we came within an open flame. so we stumbled into his clinic, and he decided to let me meet the animals.

he introduced me to his current patient, bojangles. bojangles was a 9-month-old spider monkey, that had been rescued from a rich drug dealer's private zoo. because of this, he was addicted to crack, and was rabid. me, being hungover and still slightly buzzed, decided to unlatch the cage and give him a pat.

this thing went ballistic. 
it flew out of the cage, and slammed into me, sending me flying. it began to swing around the room, screeching out this warbling war cry reminiscent of a banshee. bojangles' jet black fur became streaked with green as he struck a bottle of dish soap. this seemed to enrage him more, as he began to take out his frustrations, both sexual and rage-based, on a surgical pillow. my friend sighed, muttered "not again!" and walked to a cabinet mounted on the wall. he pulled out a taser, grabbed this monkey mid-flight, and tased it. it spasmed, violently shat out what looked like campbell's chunky beef, and fell asleep. he threw it back into the cage, smiled at me, and took a swig from a hip flask.

that monkey destroyed approximately $250 of equipment.
that monkey is now no longer a crack addict, and they're treating his rabies. 

 

edit: spoke to my friend over the phone. bojangles' rabies was onset, and the other symptoms that mimicked rabies were that of crack withdrawal, and from some drugs they'd been giving bojangles. bojangles is okay, and is being treated for other, more physical problems.

edit: front page, holy shit!

    Here is the summary: After a wild week of partying in Sao Paulo, my friend Elmer, a vet at a Brazilian wildlife rescue, introduced me to his current patient, a 9-month-old spider monkey named Bojangles, who was addicted to crack and rabid

    Here is the article: this didn't happen today, it happened a while back.

this happened in sophomore year of high school, basically the year where i committed the most screw ups possible. this is one of the big ones. it all started with my infatuation with a girl i liked, and me being the idiot i am decided to tell everyone. two of my good friends and i even started a group chat on facebook where all we did was talk about my interactions with this girl. this chat consisted of really really really embarrassing things, such as the time where my friends had talked about how her mom looked like a bollywood actress, or the time where we talked about if she liked me back or not. and the worst part was that every time i mentioned her name i added an adjective like "majestic" in front of it. eventually the group chat evolved into a group where we discussed a new bollywood club we wanted to make at our school along with our normal convos about the girl. well, one day my friend on the chat decided to jokingly screw with me and say "i'm adding the girl you like to this group chat" in order to scare me, but i knew he wasn't really going to do it. this is the part where i screwed up. i didn't know at the time that if you add someone to a group chat they are able to see the messages that were sent before they were added, so in order to mess with my friend i said "i'm not scared of you fool" and i added her myself, thinking that she wouldn't be able to see the previous messages. to make the matter even worse, since the chat was already halfway about the bollywood club we were making, i decided to just turn the chat into a full-out bollywood club chat so i added every brown person in our school to the chat as well. still under the impression that no one could see the messages above i was perfectly lax, but just to make sure i confirmed with a friend i had added in the chat that they couldn't see the other messages. it turned out that they could see every single message we had sent on that group, all the way to the top (this is months of embarrassing convos about a girl). i was expecting to full on get roasted, but surprisingly the only response i got from the girl was "um" and "yikes". all my other friends were cracking the heck up, and for about ten minutes everyone was just freaking out and reading all the messages in the convo. my friend saw the situation i was in and decided to kick out everyone from the convo and i deleted it to remove all evidence of it ever happening (atleast on my end). i'm just glad the girl was really nice about it, and now i know not to freaking add people to convos especially if they are about them.

    Here is the summary: In sophomore year of high school, the author added the girl he liked to a group chat on Facebook without realizing that she could see all the previous messages, including embarrassing conversations about her

this happened in sophomore year of high school, basically the year where i committed the most screw ups possible. this is one of the big ones. it all started with my infatuation with a girl i liked, and me being the idiot i am decided to tell everyone. two of my good friends and i even started a group chat on facebook where all we did was talk about my interactions with this girl. this chat consisted of really really really embarrassing things, such as the time where my friends had talked about how her mom looked like a bollywood actress, or the time where we talked about if she liked me back or not. and the worst part was that every time i mentioned her name i added an adjective like "majestic" in front of it. eventually the group chat evolved into a group where we discussed a new bollywood club we wanted to make at our school along with our normal convos about the girl. well, one day my friend on the chat decided to jokingly screw with me and say "i'm adding the girl you like to this group chat" in order to scare me, but i knew he wasn't really going to do it. this is the part where i screwed up. i didn't know at the time that if you add someone to a group chat they are able to see the messages that were sent before they were added, so in order to mess with my friend i said "i'm not scared of you fool" and i added her myself, thinking that she wouldn't be able to see the previous messages. to make the matter even worse, since the chat was already halfway about the bollywood club we were making, i decided to just turn the chat into a full-out bollywood club chat so i added every brown person in our school to the chat as well. still under the impression that no one could see the messages above i was perfectly lax, but just to make sure i confirmed with a friend i had added in the chat that they couldn't see the other messages. it turned out that they could see every single message we had sent on that group, all the way to the top (this is months of embarrassing convos about a girl). i was expecting to full on get roasted, but surprisingly the only response i got from the girl was "um" and "yikes". all my other friends were cracking the heck up, and for about ten minutes everyone was just freaking out and reading all the messages in the convo. my friend saw the situation i was in and decided to kick out everyone from the convo and i deleted it to remove all evidence of it ever happening (atleast on my end). i'm just glad the girl was really nice about it, and now i know not to freaking add people to convos especially if they are about them.

    Here is the summary: In sophomore year of high school, the writer became infatuated with a girl and shared embarrassing details about her in a group chat with two friends, not realizing that adding her to the chat would reveal all previous messages

    Here is the article: before i go into my fuck up. i want to tell you guys a little more about what happened before it happened.

so i am selling something for bitcoin. its not something illegal don't worry. its a digital item regarding steam. i priced it at $160. this guy saw my post and decided to hit me up.

he agreed to buy the item in exchange for bitcoins. just like all cash transactions over the internet, we had a difficult time choosing who goes first. i decided to go first after all the legit checks we could do. i then gave him my bitcoin address for him to send the money after he gets the item. he sends me a confirmation in price before sending the money. he then sends me a screenshot of him sending me the money, he sends me another screen of the confirmations. after a few minutes of waiting, i still haven't received the money so i go recheck every screenshot he sent me. i noticed that among all the random letters and numbers that make up an address. there has been 1 letter that wasn't right. (instead of a p there was a q). so right now i can't do anything about it. i didn't ask for the item back.

i dont think that the guy i was dealing with was a scammer, he was really nice and patient. i just think that a little carelessness on my part was the reason for the fuck up. i didn't re read my address to see if it was right.

 

sorry if reading this hurts the eyes. i wrote this while crying.

    Here is the summary: The author sold a digital item for Bitcoin and accidentally sent the money to the wrong address due to a minor typo in the recipient's address

    Here is the article: this happened when i was a chubby 13 year old boy who would devour anything in sight: 

i visited my mother's bedroom to find a tube of mini m&m's just sitting on the counter. me being the *fatso* that i was, i locked my sight on that m&m tube and ran towards it.

i grabbed the tube in my hand, popped the lid open, and put all the contents in my mouth.

*no ragrets*

after emptying that tube into my mouth, i had come to a horrifying realization:

*these were not m&ms*

my mom just finished cutting my little brother's toenails, and discarded the nails into that tube for an easy clean up. 

i have not touched mini m&m's since...

    Here is the summary: As a 13-year-old boy, I devoured a tube of mini M&M's without realizing they were actually my little brother's toenail clippings, leading me to develop a lifelong aversion to the candy

    Here is the article: this started on thursday but ended on saturday, or today as of posting this.

so on thursday night, i had beets for dinner. i love beets and had second helpings for myself. bad idea.

i woke up friday morning with an upset stomach, and rushed to the washroom, only to see red. or rather pinkish red. from number 2. i was a bit freaked out, but i thought i'd give it a day or so to see if this strange coloration continued. i really didn't want to google the symptoms, as i'm sure that google would tell me i had cancer, aids, and had only 2 days left to live.

i forgot about the morning incident, but was reminded when i relieved myself later that day. number 1 if you must know. the line "see red? see a doctor" was going through my head the whole night. there was no pain, but i was still anxious, and dreading releaving myself the next day in case if what i saw.

so what did i do this morning when i really had to drain the snake (if you know what i mean)? i held it. because i didn't want to see pink. or red. and then subsequently make myself go to the doctor.

eventually, i did releave myself, both 1 and 2, and was met by more pink. only then, after a day and a half of thinking i was dying did i consider that it could have been beet juice that was staining my waste reddish pink. even still, i was too scared to google my symptoms, and i was actually starting to feel slightly sick, but i think that was just placebo.

good news though, i went only 15 minutes ago as of writing this post, and saw no red or pink. i finally summoned up the nerve to google my symptoms, and found out that beet juice can indeed stain both urine and stool pink or red.

i think i'm ok now.

    Here is the summary: The author had beets for dinner on Thursday night and experienced an upset stomach and red-colored urine and stool on Friday morning, leading to anxiety and avoidance of relieving themselves

    Here is the article: as is usually not the case, this fuck-up occurred today in the very early morning. a little background: i'm a high school senior who went through a bad breakup with my girlfriend as of a couple months ago. we go to a catholic high school, so we had this "kairos / senior retreat" that we used to mend the broken aspects of our relationship. we hung out a few times after that, and ultimately i thought that this had been fixed (fuck-up number one). 

fast forward a couple of weeks, we're texting and it's pretty clear that we still have feelings for each other. she's sending me very flirtatious messages and pictures, to which the 18 year old in me rejoices. the problem was that i had been talking to another girl, nothing major, but we did have lunch once with a couple of other people, and it was primarily a study session for exams. so while i'm texting my ex, i ask her if she has any new years plans. she responds with "nothing really definite." so i suggest that we hang out, and she says that she would love to. so we make some plans to walk through a festival of lights and then head back to one of our places for dinner. however, i had not known that she found out about the other person until the day after i texted her. 
so, as she was setting up for her party, she sent a mass text to our mutual group of friends in the grade: "new years party at my house at 8. please do not bring 'osk1123.'" 
when i went to our date location, i waited about 30 minutes for her, thinking she may have just gotten lost. yet, being the bored teenager that i was, i decide to go onto snapchat where people are posting stories of the party at my ex's house. i text one of my friend's asking where she was, and this friend drunkenly responds "you're not allowed to come." eventually, i found out that my ex sent a text telling everyone that i wasn't invited. by this point, i was both furious and humiliated. 

having just been stood up and made fun of, i had some unhealthy passion in me. i went back home where my parents were having a party, borrowed one of my family friend's phones, and called the cops on my ex's party, which had tons of alcohol. 

in the next hour i had found out that the party was busted. mission accomplished!!!!...... with some unintended consequences. 

this afternoon, i had heard that she was given a ticket for unlawful distribution of alcohol to minors and possession of alcohol as a minor. this new criminal record may cost her a soccer scholarship to a small, liberal arts college to which she had previously committed. so now, i'm in bed, with the worst gut feeling, as my ex may lose her scholarship to a college soccer program. reddit, tifu. 

 

edit 1: the reason why i borrowed another person's phone in order to call the cops was to make it seem that i was not the person who did it. i have absolutely no intention of spilling this secret. 

edit 2: clearly i understand that she broke the law. i think the fuck up was in the fact that my actions *may* cost her a college scholarship. 

edit 3: just to clarify, because i'm getting a lot of hate, the other girl i was talking to and my ex are not the best of friends. my ex misthought that this was actually a date, when it was actually a study session for an exam.

    Here is the summary: The author, a high school senior, made a mistake by calling the cops on his ex-girlfriend's party, which resulted in her being given a ticket for unlawful distribution of alcohol to minors and possession of alcohol as a minor, which may cost her a college soccer scholarship

    Here is the article: obligatory this was last week.  

to preface: they say that sleep deprivation causes one to make decisions similar to that of someone under the influence of alcohol.

had been up late partying for the last few days, and was really sleep deprived.  triple shot espressos were the only thing keeping me going.  after taking my girlfriend to cheesecake factory, we went back to my place, showered, and just hung around.  we watched a movie, and pretty soon it was a little past midnight.  since she was leaving the next day to fly home for christmas, i was forcing myself to stay awake and spend time with her.  

after she fell asleep, i got hungry.  i went into the fridge and pulled out the leftovers from cheesecake.  somewhere in the process of reheating the food, i got a bit of water on my iphone.  

my first instinct was to put the phone in rice, but there wasn't any in the house.  this is where the fu happens...

my tired mind figured that if i could apply heat to the phone, the water would dry up safely.  i figure, put it in the toaster oven for a minute.   so i set it to toast and put my iphone in.  i repeat: i put my iphone in the toaster oven.  exhausted, i go lay in bed with my girl, and pass out. 

about 5 minutes later i woke up to the smell of fumes, as the screen and battery were melting.  i use a towel to remove the remains, and unplug the toaster.  

it is at this point that i have to explain to my girlfriend that i put my phone in the toaster oven to dry it off, to which she answered "go to sleep, you're drunk."  can't make this shit up folks.  get your 8 hours tonight.

    Here is the article: i'll keep this reasonably direct.  

a friend and i were about to go on a trip up to canada to see niagara falls, and seeing as we live in the southern part of america, the logical means of transportation is via the air.  we're both guys, and quite honestly we can be immature for our age when we're talking together.  usually this isn't an issue in the slightest, but it turned for the worst when we were at the airport.

we had just gone through security, got all our bags checked and our junk looked at by the tsa agents on those machines - the standard procedure for airport security these days.  we went over to the seating area to wait for boarding, but before we got on the plane, i had to use the toilet.  i went to the bathroom, and somehow, unlike half the people in this subreddit, my shit didn't somehow end up all over the place, but it smelled horrible.  i washed my hands and returned to the seating area.  absent mindedly, as somewhat immature men sometimes do, i comment on the smell to my friend.  "man, i just dropped a bomb in there", i say.  being at an airport, i couldn't have possibly chosen a worse way to say it.  

people around us hear what i said, and they start looking around nervously.  apparently a few of them decided to tell the security a man claimed to have "dropped a bomb" somewhere in the airport, because next thing i know, two tsa agents walk up to me and escort me to a back room, kind of like they do in the movies.  they start questioning me about the bomb i dropped, and i try to explain what i mean and that it was all a  mis-understanding.  luckily, they appeared to believe me.  however, they still have to have bomb-sniffing dogs come in and survey the airport, and the airport is temporarily shut down.  of course, the dogs find nothing, and a few hours later, i'm given a stiff warning but allowed to go.

my friend is both pissed off at me for causing the lock down of the airport and delaying our departure (not to mention everyone else's) by several hours, but also quite amused with the whole ridiculous situation.

    Here is the summary: I made a poorly timed and misunderstood joke about "dropping a bomb" in the airport bathroom, which led to my being escorted to a back room by TSA agents and caused a temporary shutdown of the airport, resulting in a stiff warning and several hours of delay for our flight

the guy gets near me and i throw up the sign. he smiles for one second, then looks kind of confused, then looks very confused and then just turns away with a blank expression. about one second after he passed me, i realized that i threw up the "west side" gang sign, not the wu tang w.

    Here is the article: this fu happened many years ago when i was a little kid.

so i was at the groceries with my family.  my dad finished in the checkout lane and was already pushing the cart.  he got a lot of snacks for me so i was super excited to look inside the bags.

i approached the cart that was coming at me and i assumed that it was my family's.  i didn't see who was pushing the cart since my eyes were only focused on the cart.

i untied one bag.  there was soda.  weird.  my dad never buys soda unless there's a party and there was definitely no party in my house anytime soon.

finally, i looked up.  this person wasn't my dad.  it was an old lady.

she was smiling at me.  she didn't yell at me or give me an angry look.  she looked at me and it felt like her cold eyes pierced my soul.  it was like she was smiling on the outside, but on the inside she was probably like, "if this wasn't a dang nab public place i'd blast his ass off to space with my cane."

i slowly walked backward towards my father, but she kept her icy eyes locked on me and her emotionless smile creeped its way into my nightmares.

backstory: the guy i'm pranking has been known to play a lot of girls. he's dropped a girl for my gf, dropped the gf to get back with the girl, dropped her for another girl, so on so forth.

so me and my gf were hanging out at our friend's house. lets call her samantha. we arrived at samantha's house and our male friend was there too. after a while, we were hanging out on the couch. my gf decided to go to the store to get some ice cream and trusted me with her phone.

mind you that they haven't talked in over 10 months. it all started innocently at first but then i began to notice some hints that he may still like my gf. i decide to play an elaborate prank and start giving hints that i like him. after some talking, i find out he has a girlfriend.

then i popped the question. i asked if he wanted to get back together.

he was down. he told me that he was not happy with his girlfriend and that she was fake. he told me that he was going to break up with his current gf so he could be with my gf..

this is where the i fucked up. i didn't know whether or not to stop him. after talking to my friend on the couch, i decided to stop him.
it was too late. he has already broken up with her. i had to confess that it was me the whole time and that my gf wants no association with him. i told him what a douche move that was and ranted on to him how wrong that was.

i feel no guilt but his now ex girlfriend is now crying. i feel horrible that i interfered with their relationship and made her cry. i felt like he deserved it for jumping from girl to girl.

    Here is the summary: You and your girlfriend were at a friend's house when you decided to prank her ex-boyfriend by pretending to be her and flirting with him

    Here is the article: throw-away account....

this happend a couple years back in high school. we were a group of 3 boys (a, b and me) who liked to cause trouble and we were known in our class for doing just that. not in a evil way, but just for the fun and thrill of it. 

so one thursday we were about to start the last class of that day. we had 15 minutes before it started, and so we started to fool around and throw pencils, rubbers etc. after each other. suddenly i eyed a pair of water trousers hanging on a wall. these water trousers had been hanging there for a couple of months so i thought nobody owned them. anyways, i decided to give them a good dip in a toilet and throw them on my friends. so a got really wet and decided to throw them down in the toilet again and piss on them just to end it. at this point none of us wanted to touch them and i said that we couldn't just leave them in the toilet. then b came running with a broom in his hand and violently began stabbing the water trousers down in the toilet - and flushed.

the water trousers didn't disappear completely and could barely be seen down the toilet at this point. anyways, we decided to go to class and leave them to their destiny. during our break we decided to go and have a look at the crime scene. to our surprise, some poor kid had taken a major shit and tried to flush it out with no luck. the water trousers were gone and a pool of water and shit was floating around the toilet. and like the immature and irresponsible boys we were, we decided to let destiny happen, and walk away.

friday, next day, that particular toilet was locked and the toilet in the room next to it was also locked - both with signs saying "not working". we thought it was weird that the toilet next to it also had been closed off. anyways, we went to our last class that day which was just above the schools' basement. during our class we heard some wierd noises beneath us, and our teacher thought it was funny, and jokingly said "someone is enjoying their time on toilet somewhere". and no, we boys didn't put two and two together. so class ended and off for weekend we were. 

so it became monday and i had already forgotten about last weeks bad decisions. so i got ready, got on the bus and was off for school. on my way to the main door, i saw two big trucks with their hoses going inside the school. i shrug it off and didn't give it too much thought. that was until i entered the school and a stench of shit hit me. now i finally began to realise what had happend... so i went to class and the teaching began as usual. i tried to get eye contact with my friends but they didn't seem bothered. the more i thought about it, the more certain i became that those water trousers had messed up something down in basement. that was when the speakers in the classroom turned on, and a woman said, "everybody has to come to the gym hall for a meeting immediatly." my heart sank and i nearly shit myself. 

i didn't get to talk to my friends before we went to the gym hall, so i decided to watch what the headmaster had to say from a half open door in the hall. he was very quiet at first - but then he raised his hand and in it were the infamous water trousers.

when i saw those i turned on my heels and went to the hallway. i was terrified and heard all he had to say from there, he said something like "as some of you know, a main toilet pipe has burst in the the basement. not only is the basement flooded, the toilets on the school is not working untill 12pm. a pair of water trousers have been flushed down the a toilet and have caused thousands of dollars of damage to the school. i want those who did it, or know something about it, to come forward so we can solve this.".

apparently, the water trousers had been traveling the pipes from thursday to the weekend until the pressure got so intense that the pipe broke. anyways, after the meeting i meet with my friends and they couldn't stop laughing about how unreal and messed up that situation was. 

to end the story, no one came forward as the owner of those water trousers. no one snitched, but i personally lived in fear everyday for the rest of the final year. afraid of being exposed and kicked out. to this day i can laugh about it, but back then living in fear was terrible.

    Here is the summary: A group of high school boys caused trouble by throwing water trousers down a toilet, which led to a burst pipe and thousands of dollars in damage to the school

    Here is the article: throw-away account....

this happend a couple years back in high school. we were a group of 3 boys (a, b and me) who liked to cause trouble and we were known in our class for doing just that. not in a evil way, but just for the fun and thrill of it. 

so one thursday we were about to start the last class of that day. we had 15 minutes before it started, and so we started to fool around and throw pencils, rubbers etc. after each other. suddenly i eyed a pair of water trousers hanging on a wall. these water trousers had been hanging there for a couple of months so i thought nobody owned them. anyways, i decided to give them a good dip in a toilet and throw them on my friends. so a got really wet and decided to throw them down in the toilet again and piss on them just to end it. at this point none of us wanted to touch them and i said that we couldn't just leave them in the toilet. then b came running with a broom in his hand and violently began stabbing the water trousers down in the toilet - and flushed.

    Here is the article: sorry it's kind of a long one, but if you love pantless, college girl wasted stories, then this is for you. 

finals are over, so that means i must go to the biggest party of the year and drink too much right? sounds like a great idea right, no. 

last night was the biggest and baddest party my college has to offer. my friends and i were already ready and decide to smoke a bit before we leave. we keep waiting for the address to be posted, but no one is saying anything. finally, after a hour of the weird paranoid high, we leave. 

now, before this i had also had a beer and a couple mixed drinks. i was feeling pretty good and extremely crossfaded.

at most parties i tend to not wear heavy clothing because the inside of frat houses tend to get pretty hot. i figured this would be the same so i wore black shorts, a big sweater and little booties. according to my best friend, and also my companion on this adventure, "hoes don't get cold". so, that logic was keeping me warm in my mind.

finally, onto the fuck up. we get there and the party is outside. i thankfully live in a warmer state so it was about forty degrees, not terrible for a winter's night but terrible to me. we were freezing. this was on top of a cliff, so there was hella wind and there was only one bathroom for the entire couple hundred person party. 

i thought i was going to die i was so cold. we were all pretty messed up, like too messed up to function. so after being there for half a hour, most of that spent in line for the bathroom, we decide to call our rides and bounce. 

since this was up in the mountains, in a gated community, our ubers/lyfts had a little trouble finding it as you can imagine. mine, in particular, had no idea what he was doing. at this point, sitting on the lawn of this house, is when everything really hit me. i couldn't stand or see. it was bad. 

my friend's ride got there first, so naturally i tried to go inside an already full car. begging their driver to help me, banging on the windows, and being a complete fucking mess. imagine a newborn giraffe on bath salts, that's the level of clumsy, white girl wasted i was.

finally my ride got there, my best friend and i got in and i thought i was fine. the guy was kind of a dick, but that's a different story. then, i feel it coming, and coming and then...barf. right in the car. the guy was not happy. i then continue to barf out the window, on the freeway. i lost my friend's santa hat in the process because barfing out a moving car will do that to you. 

we finally get home, my friend projectile vomits on the sidewalk, and we go inside. i go into the bathroom, take off everything from the waist down, pee, then go into my bedroom. 

now i'm half naked, barfing into a plastic bag, on the phone with my mom (who lives a hour away) crying, begging her to come over. i finally pass the fuck out with a full face of makeup on and still no pants.

this morning i woke up with my friend's barf on the carpet of my rented apartment, a text from my mom saying she's here and the knowledge of knowing that if i had just worn fucking pants, then i would have been warm and barfed at the party, avoiding the entire disaster.

    Here is the summary: The author regrets not wearing pants to a party, resulting in her being cold, drunk, and vomiting in a car and her own apartment

    Here is the article: i've browsed this sub many a time and somehow forgotten about my biggest disaster of my high school years and decided to write this one up today. this happened about 3 years ago during my senior year of high school as the waning days of the year zapped me and my friends of all motivation and responsibility.

with a college acceptance under my belt and minimal homework on a day-to-day basis, my friends and i decided we were going to eat an edible each, and then go play catch/baseball at the local middle school. all went according to plan at first. we got the edibles without a problem—two slices of delicious coffee cake that hardly tasted herby—and popped them in our mouth right before we grabbed my baseball gloves and my bat. i ate my whole edible. my friend only wanted to eat about 70% of hers and so we grabbed the equipment and got into my truck and started our drive to the school. 30 seconds into our excursion, a wave of panic hit me when i realized i didn't remember seeing my friend dispose of her unfinished edible or put it somewhere safe and out of the reach of my dogs. i frantically ask my friend where she left the edible and she tells me she doesn't remember, "maybe it's on the kitchen table..."

i turn the car around and drive like a madmen back to the house. when i barged through the door, i found my second dog licking up the remaining pieces of a presumably potentness coffee cake edible. i'm furious at this point and starting to freak out. i left the house for all of 30 seconds before my dog decided to jump up on the kitchen table and consume this edible. for the sake of context, this dog is a beautiful, skittish, and incredibly anxious mutt that ways about 50-60 pounds. if a dog could have aspergers, i'm convinced this dog would be case subject #1. she barks at anyone who enters the house, she doesn't seem to understand most people don't want to kill her, and she can only become comfortable with people who avoid eye contact with her until she decides on her own volition to start smothering them with endless affection and licks, to the point of excess. i weigh my options, as to what to do next and decide we'll go play baseball for about an hour and then come home to see how the dog is doing.

about an hour later, i'm starting to feel the effects of the edible and we make the drive home. when i get through the front door, the dog is wagging her tail at all my friends and generally being more social and happy-go-lucky than normal. i assume this is as stoned as my dog might get and decide that everything will be ok, my mom won't suspect a thing, my dog will enjoy being a little more social, and i can relax. my friends and i sit down on the couch next to my coffee table and turn on netflix, no need to worry about an overly stoned dog. we figure that we'll watch tv for a while, listen to music, eventually set up the hookah, maybe even get a little higher at some point to prepare ourselves for my legendary tacos (black beans, homemade roasted chile/garlic/peanut sauce, avacados, cilantro, cheese, mangos, and hash brown patty for extra crunch)

an hour later, disaster strikes. it it is in this moment that i realize that these edibles don't really kick in until 2 hours after consumption. after an hour, the edibles give you a nice little nudge that says, "hey man, you're nice and giggly and hungry, isn't this nice?" after two hours, the edibles knock you on your ass as if muhammad ali himself punched you in the face with strength of 1000 bong rips. from hour 2 until hour 7 at which point i would go to bed, i do not leave my couch. right as it hits, i know that i have reached the point of no return. movement is out of the question. mila kunis could be in my living room, begging me to sit on my face if i moved my legs and i wouldn't have been able to muster the energy. i could have been offered a full ride scholarship to the school of my choice in exchange for walking 5 steps and it wouldn't have happened. i am completely immobile and worthless in this moment. i am also way too stoned at the time to contemplate what exactly my dog is feeling so for the moment, i sit back in my couch, enjoying being absolutely smacked as the room gets darker and darker because i'm too stoned to get up and turn on the light. 

after an unknowable amount of time sitting on the couch, i finally am reminded of the existence of my dog as she comes into the corner of my eye. i am too stoned to move, but my dog is too stoned to remember how her limbs work. as she slowly makes her way over to me, she looks not unlike an alien inhibiting a dog's body, trying to figure out the mechanical function of each individual leg. she slowly raises her right front leg in the air and extends it all the way to a straight line before placing it down on the ground, and then does the same thing with her left leg, and then each hind leg. all in all, walking across the living room takes my dog a good 30 seconds as she tries to figure out how to function stoned.

feeling sorry for my poor dog, i pick her up and hold her in my lap and she starts staring at the ceiling. normally this dog puts up a fair amount of resistance to being carried and is prone to squirming away after five seconds, but the dog is too far gone to even protest. for the next half hour (although it could have only been two minutes given my inability to perceive the passage of time), the dog sits motionless on my lap as we both try and figure out how in the world we are supposed to function as normal representatives of our respective species. 

i don't remember letting the dog out of my lap, but at some point i must have done so because from behind me, i all of a sudden heard my mom speaking to me in a panicked voice: "______, i think the dog is having a stroke. she's having trouble walking and she keeps falling over on her side." 

in any normal situation, hearing about my dog being unable to walk would scare the hell out of me. at this point in my life, the rules of stonedness in the house were generally to keep it under wraps, get good grades, don't be obvious, and don't drive stoned. being too stoned to function and think logically, i do not do the logical thing and tell my mom that the dog is stoned, that everything is ok, she just needs to sleep it off, or at the very least vomit the thc out of her system. instead, without turning around and even facing my mom or look her in the eye, i remain motionless on the couch and calmly tell her, "ok mom, let me know how it goes." 

my mom leaves the house in a hurry and although i am rather out of it, i get the feeling my mom is furious by my nonchalance. in retrospect, in this situation the reasonable thing would have been to tell her exactly what was up. in her mind of course, the dog was dying and i'm sure she thought that i was being a horrible son by not even mustering up the energy to get my ass off the couch and come with her to the vet for some emotional support as she faced the possibility of our second dog having a debilitating stroke. 

at this point of the edible experience, i am no longer aware what hour it is. my friends remain at the house, but i am off in my own world, unable to even make them food, keep good conversation, or even be a good guest. at some point, i remember my mom texting me that the vet told her that the dog had either eaten radiator fluid or was super stoned. knowing we had no radiator fluid in the house, my mom then knew that somehow the dog had eaten something filled with thc. in my stoned genius, rather than out myself, i make up a half-assed story that my friend had been carrying an edible for a friend in her bag and that the dog (who had been known to attack trader joe's grocery bags left out, tupperware left on the counter, even my mother's luggage that had chocolate sweets in it only hours before she was supposed to fly to mexico), got into her bag and ate the edible. somehow, my mom didn't give me or my friends a lot of shit, and other than feeling immense guilt for racking up a hefty vet bill, i didn't face any tangible consequence for getting my dog to an [11]. amazingly, this story held up with my mom for more than three years. only last week we talked about this whole incident and i explained to her i had simply been too stoned to make rational decisions or be a good son and fess up to my stupidity. we had a good laugh about it but she was amazed that i never told her what happened as it was happening, as it would have saved us a big medical bill.

    Here is the summary: The author, who was in high school at the time, and their friends ate edibles and went to play catch, but the author's dog ate the edible and became stoned

feeling sorry for my poor dog, i pick her up and hold her in my lap and she starts staring at the ceiling. normally this dog puts up a fair amount of resistance to being carried and is prone to squirming away after five seconds, but the dog is too far gone to even protest. for the next half hour (although it could have only been two minutes given my inability to perceive the passage of time), the dog sits motionless on my lap as we both try and figure out how in the world we are supposed to function as normal representatives of our respective species. 

i don't remember letting the dog out of my lap, but at some point i must have done so because from behind me, i all of a sudden heard my mom speaking to me in a panicked voice: "______, i think the dog is having a stroke. she's having trouble walking and she keeps falling over on her side." 

in any normal situation, hearing about my dog being unable to walk would scare the hell out of me. at this point in my life, the rules of stonedness in the house were generally to keep it under wraps, get good grades, don't be obvious, and don't drive stoned. being too stoned to function and think logically, i do not do the logical thing and tell my mom that the dog is stoned, that everything is ok, she just needs to sleep it off, or at the very least vomit the thc out of her system. instead, without turning around and even facing my mom or look her in the eye, i remain motionless on the couch and calmly tell her, "ok mom, let me know how it goes." 

my mom leaves the house in a hurry and although i am rather out of it, i get the feeling my mom is furious by my nonchalance. in retrospect, in this situation the reasonable thing would have been to tell her exactly what was up. in her mind of course, the dog was dying and i'm sure she thought that i was being a horrible son by not even mustering up the energy to get my ass off the couch and come with her to the vet for some emotional support as she faced the possibility of our second dog having a debilitating stroke. 

at this point of the edible experience, i am no longer aware what hour it is. my friends remain at the house, but i am off in my own world, unable to even make them food, keep good conversation, or even be a good guest. at some point, i remember my mom texting me that the vet told her that the dog had either eaten radiator fluid or was super stoned. knowing we had no radiator fluid in the house, my mom then knew that somehow the dog had eaten something filled with thc. in my stoned genius, rather than out myself, i make up a half-assed story that my friend had been carrying an edible for a friend in her bag and that the dog (who had been known to attack trader joe's grocery bags left out, tupperware left on the counter, even my mother's luggage that had chocolate sweets in it only hours before she was supposed to fly to mexico), got into her bag and ate the edible. somehow, my mom didn't give me or my friends a lot of shit, and other than feeling immense guilt for racking up a hefty vet bill, i didn't face any tangible consequence for getting my dog to an [11]. amazingly, this story held up with my mom for more than three years. only last week we talked about this whole incident and i explained to her i had simply been too stoned to make rational decisions or be a good son and fess up to my stupidity. we had a good laugh about it but she was amazed that i never told her what happened as it was happening, as it would have saved us a big medical bill.

    Here is the summary: The author, who was a high school senior at the time, and their friends ate edibles and went to play catch, but the author's dog ate the entire edible and became stoned, leading to a series of misadventures and a trip to the vet

    Here is the article: so i'm doing a summer internship as part of the long summer following gcses and i'm working in this big open plan office with a bunch of people. this job is incredibly boring and so to alleviate some of the soul destroying monotony i decide to go make myself a cup of tea. as i do so my boss comes over to make himself a coffee on the machine opposite. he starts talking to me and asks all the usual stuff that adults feel they have to when they talk to teenagers, specifically what sports i'm into. i tell him i'm into football and begin to bring the tea back to where i was sitting and it's at this point i should mention my boss is a bit overweight. he decided to inform me about how he was an avid user of the gym and had been going every other day since he was my age and he said i should give it a look. maybe it was the absolute sincerity with which he said it or perhaps it was the way that his double chin seemed to be trying to nod in agreement but at this point i just lost it and burst out laughing in front of the whole office. i was unable to keep a hold of the tea in my hands and to add insult to injury i spilt the hot tea all over him. as i already mentioned this was an open plan office so absolutely everyone saw as my boss was almost reduced to tears by my horrible reaction.

    Here is the article: this was pretty embarrassing.

 i went to the dentist after work to have my teeth cleaned and as usual they bring you back to the chair and the assistant cleans your teeth then leaves you be till the dentist arrives. 

i work in an industry where i tend to inhale tiny particles at times (even with a mask) so i usually have to blow my nose a few times a day to keep the sinuses fresh. well anyways, my nose was itching heavily in the seat and i just needed to pick it. secretly, i tilted my head to the side and ended up landing on a monster booger. as im plucking it out, i turn right and see my dentist with a smile and a hand held out toward me for a handshake as i hesitantly look over in the process of pulling a booger out. i quickly said "wow im so sorry i didnt hear anyone walking behind me" as im holding this booger in my right hand. i went to the bathroom and "cleaned up" but man was i embarrassed. im not a very anxious person per say but i wasnt eager to walk back to that chair.

its safe to say he didnt rub it in through the tooth check; the handshake never happened though and i feel that was mutual.

    Here is the summary: The author went to the dentist for a teeth cleaning and ended up embarrassingly picking a booger during the procedure, which the dentist witnessed while offering a handshake

for my math class we have to use the mymathlab website. well it turns out the code i purchased for the last time i took a math class will work for the class i'm taking this semester, but here i am with a brand new textbook and the access code for my class. i only really needed the access code but i got the book and the code because it was almost the same price as just getting the code. 

and to top it all off, i can't find my receipt to return either of these books.

    Here is the article: i have big hands. big, meaty, man hands.

she is slender and narrow, beautiful and blonde. we both like whisky too much. last night- well, last night i fucked up. i guess it was this morning. we fucked up.

the whisky made making a bad decision easy. but that isn't really fair- we didn't decide to fuck up. we didn't decide to try fisting. we didn't decide to break her tailbone. but it happened...

after a few drinks, our conversation became sexual, each of us talking about fantasies that we have never fulfilled. for me; a good threesome (aka not the devil's threesome). for her; well, she wanted to get fisted.

fisted? i ask. 

fisted. she answers. 

like a sock puppet? (i still think she is joking). 

she laughs, sapphire blue eyes sparkling with jack-mormon mischief, takes a drink, changes the subject. and we finish our conversation and we finish our bottle and we smoke some smoke and we head toward the bedroom.

yada yada yada; change scene. our two players are naked and sloppy drunks. she is perfect (except for having the world's worst tattoo- giant angel wings across her entire back, but i digress). she looks at me with trouble twinkling in her eyes.

"sock puppet me, baby," she tells me. of course, i laugh- funny sex time joke. but she is serious. she wants me to fist her.

big, meaty, man hands; i am almost 6'4'', big and broad. she is lithe and narrow- i would be surprised if she weighs more than 110 pounds. looking at my hand while i type- what the hell was i thinking?

how did i think i could fit this fist in her? how could she want that? but she started hopping around on the bed, "sock puppet me, sock puppet me." who am i to blow against the wind?

i won't get into the logistics of fisticuffs- i am sure there is a subreddit for that somewhere. but (at least the first time) it takes a little work, a little wiggle and jiggle to get the haymaker in there. 

her begging and hopping got me hot to the idea, i must admit; all hands on deck. i was gonna sock puppet her. i was into it. until i heard... no, i felt- her tailbone break. felt the bottom of her spine pop and shift.

it was fucking awful. pop, crack. she didn't scream- she didn't have to. i was freaked out- "oh shit, oh shit, are you okay?" at first, she played it way cool; she has her coccyx broken from the inside all the time sorta attitude. 

her air of indifference did not last long, however. soon enough, she was limping, struggling to walk, her laughing eyes touched by tears of pain. we are going to the doctor today- so yes, it may not be broken. i ain't no ass-bone doctor.

i feel absurdly guilty- i broke my tailbone playing football one semester, and i could not sit without pain for months. despite my guilt, i immediately thought of tifu. you are all welcome. i fucked up so you don't have to. don't do the sock-puppet.

 

edit/update: the ass-bone doctor's diagnosis confirmed my initial assessment. i broke it. apparently, this type of injury happens pretty often during child birth. the circle of life.

    Here is the summary: The author and his partner, who is slender and blonde, enjoy whisky and engage in sexual conversations that lead to fisticuffs, with the author attempting to fist his partner despite his big, meaty hands and her narrow body, resulting in her tailbone being broken

i received a phone call that showed up on my caller id as my own number. i answered and an automated voice said that there was an issue with my at&t account and that they needed the aforementioned last four digits of my social to verify my identity. 

having recently (about one hour prior) changed my wireless data plan with at&t, i thought nothing of it and obliged with the digits. the call ended about ten seconds later. 

after a few minutes i realized that i fell for one of the simplest phishing scams out there. i did some detective work on google and found that other people receive these calls as well, mostly under the premise that their bank account has been breached.

how fucked am i? is there anything i should do to minimize the self inflicted damage?

    Here is the article: when i was 13, i never liked school and would use any excuse i could to get out of going to it. then one day while my grandparents were visiting i was too lazy and tired to even make a good excuse, so i told them that my ankle was in immense pain, and promptly my grandfather didn't believe me (i had done this many times before to him, and he refused to let it happen again.) so what went through my crazy teenage mind was persist on telling him it's in bad shape, so then maybe he would believe me. boy was i wrong, when he couldn't take it anymore he took me to the hospital as fast as he could, and told them that my foot was in pain.
 we waited there for about 3 hours before they finally called me in. at this point we were both tired and sick of this, so when they started testing me and getting x-rays of my ankle my grandfather started talking to me in a condescending voice about how i'm in big trouble if this turned out fake, and if it was true we're smart to have done this. about an hour after testing me the doctor came in with a nurse and told me that since i was still fairly young that they couldn't be sure if it was broken or not from the x-rays, so they thought the safest path to go down was to put a cast on me and wait for the pain to go away, when i heard this my mind was shown clearly on my face, complete shock, and knowledge i was going to be caught. when they decided to put the cast on they told me the clothes i was wearing now wouldn't work so they gave me some basketball shorts that should be a "one size fits all", but what they felt and looked like were a "one size fits an obese adult". after they put the cast on, my grandfather had been convinced that there really was something wrong with me, so i was thinking that i was in the clear, and i had never been more wrong in my life.
 we got out somewhere around noon, and then went home, and i put on some fitting basketball shorts over my cast and waited for school to get out, so when i did i sneaked my way out of the house and waited at the bus stop, and when my friends got off they laughed at me non-stop and i told them my story, during that time i was so focused on them i didn't notice the familiar car driving up next to me, and when my friends faces got dark, i turned around and saw my grandparents staring at me with utter shock that soon turned to anger, and i was left in complete fear, and hope that this was a prank.

i was able to get a cheap round trip ticket to seoul at the last minute after my friends started talking about the best kbbq they've ever had.  as i wanted to find the source of this delicious food, i booked a place in seoul.  the week went fast and i didn't get close to enough to eat.  in fact the most memorable meal i can remember from there is a [hamburger](http://i.imgur.com/9adbk2e.jpg) and maybe the [chizza from kfc](http://i.imgur.com/acongcb.jpg).  by the time i had to leave i felt the need to stuff myself with as much korean food as possible.  being a frequent traveller by that point, i knew that i had to arrive early so i got to the airport with two and a half hours to spare and about 20 pounds of tsa sized kimchi in my backpack.  so i stopped by a dessert place and [ate](http://i.imgur.com/acongcb.jpg) as slowly as possible.  
    
15 minutes passed.  still hungry i trudged the terminal looking for a real meal.  after what seemed to be an eternity of walking i found a nice little korean place serving both kimbap and kimchee noodles.  score!  i ordered both and proceeded to wait.  and wait. and wait.  by the time my noodles arrived my flight was an hour and a half out.  no problem!  i slurped up the [noodles](http://i.imgur.com/ejphida.jpg) (which turned out to be instant) and scarfed the [kimbap](http://i.imgur.com/4vzqbo3.jpg) down like the pig i am.
    
by this point in time i figured i would have an hour and 15 minutes to clear security, immigration, then get to my terminal.  plenty of time, right?  still, i hustled to the security checkpoint.  and waited.  and waited.  apparently between my arriving at the airport and my meal, the line grew exponentially.  i cleared with 30 minutes to go.  whew!  (or so i thought)
    
i came to realize that my flight leaves from the very far end of a remote terminal.  with 30 minutes remaining, i moved from a hustle to a jog.  due to my timing, i missed the last train and had to wait another 5 minutes for the slow ass train to arrive.   when the train finally arrived, i shove myself in like the captain of the costa concordia and waited for the rest of the passengers to load.  then i waited. and waited. and waited.  i sat in a quiet rage as the old korean lady with a cane attempted to mind the gap.  for all the drama she went through you'd think she was jumping the grand canyon.  eventually the train doors closed and the people mover slowly trundled to the remote terminal.  this damn country has maglev trains and the best internet but the airport relies on a piece of shit meat bucket to move people from terminal to terminal.  revenge of the kims at its finest.  
    
when i finally exit the train, i hear my named being screamed.  i get in touch with the lady screaming my name who tells me to hurry up and run.  she runs along side of my fat ass telling me to run faster the whole time and screams into her radio to ground crew while wearing high heels.  i am out of breath carrying an overweight backpack stuffed with kimchee in 100g packets as i complete the half mile sprint to the gate.  fortunately for me, the metal sausage has yet to leave the gate and the kimchee hadn't burst.  they held the plane just for me.  i boarded and took my seat in the very back row, facing death stares from about 200 passengers.  i don't care; i made my flight!  an hour delay as our pilot missed the window but we're finally off!  being next to the toilets, i peruse them several times and fall asleep on my bag of kimchee.
    
eventually we make it to the arrival airport.  i let the other passengers disembark first, as i don't want to risk any damage to my kimchi.  i make my way out of the skybridge and down and escalator and then [stopped](http://i.imgur.com/ewk6ss1.jpg).  apparently, my delaying the flight caused the flights to stack up which resulted in a surge to one immigration counter with only two staff working.  yup, so many counters yet only two people working.  staff numbers are based on flight plans well in advance so we were stuck with two immigration officers clearing all of us.  i took this picture, then made myself and my kimchee as small as possible.  afterwards, another plane landed and caused even more of a backup.

    Here is the summary: The author's last-minute trip to Seoul resulted in a series of unfortunate events, including a delayed flight, a long wait in immigration, and a near-miss with a burst bag of kimchi

    Here is the article: * i made a throwaway account, because on my main account, i know you can find out who i am, and i don't want my youngest sister knowing that i posted this online.  i just want to vent a bit, because, i fucked up

well, it wasn't today, it was two days ago on friday around 10pm or so when my older brother called, my older brother has been a big family issue for the last couple years because of a huge family issue that was revealed around in december/january of 2013/2014, but i will get to that in a bit.

after i got out of work, my sisters picked me up from work, and let me know that my older brother was calling multiple times trying to talk to me, they didn't know what he wanted me to talk about to him, but, they wanted me to talk to have him stop calling nonstop.

around 10pm or so, he called, and he wanted me to talk to his son and daughter, to see how they were doing and everything, i talked two his daughter, and she was very lively in talking to me, and we talked about her schoolwork, what she did over the summer and other things, while his son was super shy, and didn't want to talk at all.  

after i talked to them for a while, my brother got back on and asked me if my sisters or my nephews(my sisters nephews who were living with us) wanted to talk to them.  one of my nephews was up, and my youngest sister was still up.

* before i get into the next part of the story, i want to give some backstory to the huge family issues we have been having for the last two years.

* before i start the backstory, i going to talk a tiny bit on my family, so you have an idea who i am talking about. 

there is my oldest sister(the "cult leader" who is not a cult leader at all), my oldest brother(the most fucked up person of the family), my older brother(the person i am talking about above, and the real asshole), myself(the idiot), and my youngest sister(the victim here)

in october of 2013, my oldest brother, was having a wedding, with his girlfriend of about five years, and we were invited to his wedding, so we took two weeks off and went on a road trip and visit many states and checked out cool landmarks on the way.  but, something during this trip triggered a very dark and messed up memory in my youngest sister's mind, which, took a while before she remember the whole story, which, the brother who was having his wedding, back when my sister was ten, molested her and maybe even raped her.

i don't know why he did, but it might of been connected to our father's passing in 2000.  i do not know the details and do not want to know them at all either, but in 2014, my sister confronted my oldest brother, and he confirmed he, that really did happen, and she is not remembering something that wasn't real.  also our mother basically toss the thing under the rug and my youngest sister pushed that memory into the back of her mind.

basically, after a while, my sister basically called back where we used to live(where the "rape") happen and charged my brother with statutory raped with a minor(she was 10 years old at the time), but because of the budget of the state/county of where we used to live where it happen, they couldn't send out an officer to go to where he lives and arrest him, so this pissed off my sister a lot knowing that he getting off free because they won't send someone to arrest him.

also, my brother knows that there is warrent out for his arrest, and has cut all contact from his family because of it, even thought he was "sorry" for what he did back then.  i haven't heard from him since then.

but, the backstory is not over yet, a little after the wedding, there were rumors going on that my oldest brother has gotten his wife pregnant, which, was the main factor on my youngest sister of putting out a warrant for his arrest, because he didn't want that child to have happen to her to happen to it.  after that, it was confirmed he was pregnant, but after the news of her husband raped her youngest sister when she was ten, she either had it aborted or she lost it because of the stress of the news or something, i do not know how she lost it.

* now, for some of my older brothers backstory.  after the news broke out between the family members(my sisters, brothers and i) my older brother for some reason tried controlling the issue in the family, which wasn't his issue to control, like he didn't want my sister to tell our aunts and uncles about the news, but for some reason, he went around her and was the one that told them, which pissed of my sister like no tomorrow, and other things that happen during the issue.  

during the time this was happening, my youngest sister was seeing a psychologist, and they said to not give out any more info to the family, except to people living in the household(myself, herself, our oldest sister and her nephews) so my older brother couldn't wouldn't know what is going, which caused him to get pissed, and being more demanding, and trying to say if you don't tell him what is going on, he wouldn't let her talk or see his kids anymore, which made her even more pissed, and basically made her just hate him.

basically there were multiple issues that my older brother blaims my youngest sister for, a couple are: making us lose a brother, blaiming her for the death of his brother's unborn child, and tons of other things she hates him for because of it.

* back to the main story, i go out to the living room and ask my sister if she wanted to talk to my older brothers kids at all, which she was extremely against and did not want to talk, so i told my older brother that she was doing homework and couldn't talk(i lied so make her seem busy), and went to go ask my nephew if he wanted to talk.

but, he went to sleep during the time i asking my sister about that, and them my sister yelled at me staying they had to goto bed early because they needed to do something in the morning, which for some reason made my brother believe she wasn't doing homework, and was avoiding him, so he told me that he would his daughter on the phone, and he wouldn't be even near it.  

then, i asked my sister again, and she was extreme pissed that i asked that again, even thought i told her that it was his daughter on the phone, and he wasn't going to be part of the call at all, she said no i don't want to talk, and wouldn't changed her mind, and i became flustered, and i said to my older brother's daughter that "she did not want to talk to her right now", which i relies what i was saying and i changed it to "she was busy right now", and my sister overheard me saying that, and gave me a very angry look while i went back to my room.

so, i told her to give back the phone to my brother, which my brother was pissed, and went on a rant saying that she is playing the victim and why doesn't see want to talk to them and stuff, after he ranted for a while, we say goodbye to each other, and he wanted my cell number so he can talk to me without dealing with my house phone(because my sisters do not want to answer it when he is calling) and then went to the living room where my sister was at.  

she told me that she did not want even talk to his kids while he was around, because that was his way of getting to her and his oldest sister, using his kids as pawn to try to pry in matters that did not matter to him.  she also said that she hated him for everything that he said after the whole issue i explained above, and she was even more pissed at me for saying to her niece that she did not want to talk to her, even thought she really do want to talk to her and her nephew too, but, she knowns that her brother uses them to ask her stuff, and he listens who that she is saying to them, and such.  if he didn't call and his wife did, my sister would gladly talk to his kids if he wasn't around. 

i told her that i told her that out frustration i said that to her niece by accident and i did not mean to say that, but, she didn't care, she was angry with me because i said that to her niece.  after this all happen she poured the everything on why she hates her older brother because of the family issue, and then started crying, which i left her alone after that, and listen to some sigur ros (their () album) to help calm me down and i went to sleep afterwards.

the next day, when i went to work i got a text from my older brother asking if my nephews are free to talk to his kids now, and said i was at work so i don't know. after i got out of work, and my oldest sister found out about last night from her youngest sister and we had a long talk about last night and everything, and we thought everything was going to be fine.

but, for some reason my older brother called again, asking if my nephews wanted to talk to his son and daughter.  but, because of the big fight that happen last night, i didn't want to talk to my brother, because i was pissed off because of the fight, and didn't want to deal with him at all after what happen.  well, this for some reason pissed off my brother, and because of it, made him think my oldest sister was controlling me in some way, which she is not.  i wanted to rest after a long day of work, and didn't want to deal with it.  

after a while my brother was getting super pissed, and demand i talk to him, because he believes my sister is controlling me like some type of cult leader, and is controlling me to doing what is best for the family and won't let me do things because of various reasons. he believes that i won't drive, go to college, or various others things because she wouldn't let me do them, but the real reason is because i did not want to do them, or i was lazy as fuck, she is not controlling me in any way.

finally, i talked to him saying to him that i didn't want to talk to him because i was tired from work, and because a issue from last night, that i didn't want to talk about yet.  he was very pushy and wanted me to talk about it, and i said not now, but he wouldn't leave it alone, so i hung up on him, then he was texting me saying my oldest sister was a cult leader, and was going to tell his wife about this and everything and i turned off my phone so i wouldn't get 5000 messages from him.  

after this whole issue, i talked to my sisters and i wanted to explain to my older brother on why my youngest sister had a huge deal on friday night, but they said it would be a very bad idea, and they said don't talk about it, but they said if i want to reveal to him it, they would be fine with it, but my youngest sister said that he might retaliate against my oldest sister because of it, and she doesn't want her to deal with this because it being close to her birthday and everything.

and that is the story up to now, my older brother hasn't contacted me in the past day or so, but, i don't know what to say to him, because i don't want to hurt my oldest sister at all, but i do want him to know why my sister was like that the other night, i don't know what do, but i will figure something out.

* thanks for reading this guys, i will try to post more when there is more info to spread around and everything, thanks.

but, for some reason my older brother called again, asking if my nephews wanted to talk to his son and daughter.  but, because of the big fight that happen last night, i didn't want to talk to my brother, because i was pissed off because of the fight, and didn't want to deal with him at all after what happen.  well, this for some reason pissed off my brother, and because of it, made him think my oldest sister was controlling me in some way, which she is not.  i wanted to rest after a long day of work, and didn't want to deal with it.  

after a while my brother was getting super pissed, and demand i talk to him, because he believes my sister is controlling me like some type of cult leader, and is controlling me to doing what is best for the family and won't let me do things because of various reasons. he believes that i won't drive, go to college, or various others things because she wouldn't let me do them, but the real reason is because i did not want to do them, or i was lazy as fuck, she is not controlling me in any way.

finally, i talked to him saying to him that i didn't want to talk to him because i was tired from work, and because a issue from last night, that i didn't want to talk about yet.  he was very pushy and wanted me to talk about it, and i said not now, but he wouldn't leave it alone, so i hung up on him, then he was texting me saying my oldest sister was a cult leader, and was going to tell his wife about this and everything and i turned off my phone so i wouldn't get 5000 messages from him.  

after this whole issue, i talked to my sisters and i wanted to explain to my older brother on why my youngest sister had a huge deal on friday night, but they said it would be a very bad idea, and they said don't talk about it, but they said if i want to reveal to him it, they would be fine with it, but my youngest sister said that he might retaliate against my oldest sister because of it, and she doesn't want her to deal with this because it being close to her birthday and everything.

and that is the story up to now, my older brother hasn't contacted me in the past day or so, but, i don't know what to say to him, because i don't want to hurt my oldest sister at all, but i do want him to know why my sister was like that the other night, i don't know what do, but i will figure something out.

* thanks for reading this guys, i will try to post more when there is more info to spread around and everything, thanks.

    Here is the article: just last night i got back from a long day of work, so i decided to have a glass of wine and watch tv before bed. seems like a nice way to end a day, and surely the next would be better, right? not quite. 

today i got out of work an hour or so earlier than usual and decided to do some dishes, but had forgotten to grab the wine glass on the dresser the television's on, where i had apparently left the night before. 

so, as usual i turned on some music from the tv speakers and cranked up the volume so i could hear it over the sink running and pass the time. it was set on shuffle and a few songs had played...

and then my own song came on. 

apparently from the ear-destructing noise and high volume, the dresser had vibrated just enough to move the wine glass teetering over the edge and shatter on the floor. 

now the mini bar has one empty spot and it won't stop mocking me every time i walk in and glance at it.

    Here is the article: **you guys are going to think this is a load of bs, but i'm sure as hell not posting photographic proof.**

alright, so i'm a dumbass high schooler that just got his license, so naturally i'm finding any excuse to drive. my neighbor, let's call her k, is a grade below me, with an 11 year old brother. we live in the middle of *nowhere*, and she has a long driveway that the bus can't make it up, so it just drops her and her bro off at the bottom. well, parents won't let me drive to school, but as soon as i get off the bus they let me go over there and take k and her brother up their driveway for them. we were just screwing around one day and k's bro got on top of the car before i started driving them up. for whatever reason, i saw him through the sunroof taking off his belt and unbuckling his pants. i didn't want to know what was going to happen next, so i hit the gas hard. somehow he hangs on all the way up to the house, but when we get there and i slam on the brakes, his pants and underwear come totally down to his ankles, and he slides down the windshield, leaving kid-dick smear all the way down. at this point, k runs inside shielding her eyes, and i'm laughing my ass off. the little brother, laughing but also super embarrassed, pulls up his boxers, waddles over to his porch, and grabs some kind of jacked up illegal airsoft gun. i knew this bastard was going to try to get revenge on me, so i start running back to the car, but... didn't make it. he pegged me right in the ass and i just fell to the ground writhing in pain. it legitimately broke the skin through my jeans and their pockets, and began bleeding all over the place. the brother is now laying on the ground crying with laughter, pants still at his feet. once i recover enough to get up. i run over, pin him to the ground, and throw the gun as far as i can. at this point, k steps back outside to see wtf is going on, and sees me, furious, straddling her crying little brother with blood soaked jeans and his pants around his ankles. he screams "raaaape!" and his sister flips the fuck out. *luckily*, she knows what a dumbass he is and somehow believed my explanation. this was about 4 days ago, i still have a new hole in my ass and it hurts to sit.

    Here is the article: a little bit of background info for this story. i'm in my school's grade eleven ib program, and there are two geography classes each containing ~25 kids. i am in class a, where we take it half of this year and half of next year, and the other half of grade eleven ib students are in the one that oes the full year. we both have to do an ia, which is essentially a big paper that both classes have to do. class a (my class) has to do one on t he topic of our choice using secondary data, and is worth 20% of our grade for this year. the other class is doing theirs on a local business and it's influence on the surrounding area. their paper is worth 25% of their grade and is sent off to ib hq, wherever that is. now on to the tifu part. 

as part of their data collection, they decide to do a survey. they all posted it on their facebook walls and encouraged everyone to participate. fast forward to ~3 weeks ago, where i get a "clever" idea. during computer science class, i go on to their survey, on a monitored and keylogged school computer, and fill out a joke survey. i was going to do it from home, but figured that i would forget it by then. i fill it out in the stupidest way possible, answering every question with the most ridiculous answer imaginable. i said that i lived across the country, i never have been there before, shopped there daily and went there exclusively for hand lotion. basically stupid shit like that. 

after i fill out, i click submit. after a while of waiting, i start refreshing the page. after about a minute of that, i exit the page and redo the survey. after i click submit, it states "the survey you have requested is no loner available or you are not allowed to participate," which i chalked up to me repeatedly trying to access the server and it getting pissy or something. i then proceed to forget all about it and move on with my life. a few of my other friends talked about how they filled out their own joke surveys too, my favorite being one where every answer was clicked other and typed in "insert student in class b"'s mom. 

later that week is when i realize the fuckup. i notice how everyone on facebook is getting complaints about the survey being down. i think nothing of it until i hear one of my friends from class b mention it. i put two and two together and realize what happened. this is the most logical explanation i could think up: i was sending a survey every time that i refreshed. i asked my friend if there was a limit as to how many surveys they could store, and he said 200. i don't know how many people actually did these surveys, but i would assume not many. what i just realized i did was spam a very important part of an assignment worth 25% of a whole class' grade with bs joke surveys. i quickly think up how to fix this without implicating myself, and did possibly one of the worst thins possible; i told my friend what happened.

this friend i told is a good guy, but he can not keep a secret. my logic was that he could mention to the teacher that the survey was down, and that they should make another, thus fixing the issue. instead, he tells everyone that i did it. now i have a whole half of the ib grade eleven, and apparently half of the grade 12 ib population who were relying on the survey too, hating my guts. word spread like wild fire and i had no idea what to do. everything seemed to die down for a while, and i thought that it may have blown over. i fiured that he must have tipped off the teacher to the problem and it was resolved, as no further news reached me about the situation. then one day someone from class b comes up and hands my class' teacher a thumb drive with the survey data. she was for some reason going to compile the data for the students. this made me double down on the belief that the survey had been fixed, as surely the teacher would have skimmed through to look for stuff like this. the next day when we were writing a test, my teacher stepped outside of the room to take a call. i heard the words "computer science" "survey" and "joke". i knew the jig was up.

i knew at this point that it was only a matter of time before i was caught, but i had a thin at lunch that i couldn't miss. i get to school every day ~45 minutes before first bell, so i figured that i could just tell her the next morning and save my lunch. then she gets another phone call and i knew she knew it was me. at bell, she asked me to stay behind for a few minutes. i instantly spilled the whole story and she seemed to believe it. at the end, she asked if i acted alone, and if i knew if anyone outside of the computer science class had done the same kind of thing. i so far had thrown 0 people under the bus, which i was very proud of. i took 110% responsibility for my part to play. i knew lots of people besides me where involved, but i sure as hell wasn't going to rat them out. i told her that i heard rumors of other people doing it, mainly outside of computer science. i told her very vague info and said that it was bound to happen when it was posted on facebook. she let me o 5 minutes in to lucnh, which was very nice.

how did she found out it was me? the friend i told to bring it up to the teacher told on me. the teacher of class b asked if anyone knew about the joke surveys and who did them, and he instantly said it was me. thanks bro. anyway, fast forward to the next day and i walk in to computer science. i go to log on to the computer and it states that my account "has expired or has been disabled, please see a system administrator," which i instantly knew was because of the survey. i have no idea how i am going to get through the rest of computer science without a computer, but whatever. then, my geo teacher walks in and tells us how we should be ashamed of screwing up the survey, and anyone responsible should come forward. every one turned and looked at me. she then left and class went on as usual. i noticed a dramatic shift in people and how they acted around and to me. they seemed to over night start hating me almost. everyone already knew that i did it, so i never understood why everyone was suddenly so pissed. 

i lived the next week almost in a constant state of being hated, which was...unique. i had to go talk to people about this whole charity thing for people without homes during the winter, and every class that was an ib one had people making snarky remarks to me. i didn't really care, i never have been one to get hurt by what people say. i only have a hand full of good friends in ib, most of them are outside of it. i guess looking back it is clear that i am way different from them, it was only a matter of time before they started hating me. i figured going in to ib if nothing else would get rid of the caddyness of people, but it really only made it worst. you'd figure a group full of the smartest people in school would be the least likely to be that way, but they are by far and large the worst. 

two days ago i found out why i had such a public opinion change; the original friend that i told decided to start this up again by telling everyone that not only did i do it, but i did it on purpose. i overheard him telling a group about how i maliciously did this, and i intervened. i walked up and told him that's not what happened, told them what did happen, and told my friend to stfu and talking like that could easily get me kicked out of ib. he got very defensive and i figured i wasn't going to change anything and walked away. 

i currently am in fear of what monday brings, as this friend is one of the best if not the best kid grades wise in ib, and is known for his honesty. if he tells my geo teacher, who is the head of my school's ib department, i will definitely be kicked out of ib, or at least denied my ib full diploma. i honestly have no idea what to do, and i feel like the enemies are at the gates.

ib students from grade eleven went on a field trip for a whole school day three days ago, and it was super awkward for me. ib is a very small portion of the school's students, and because of that i will be having class together with these lovely people for the next two years who a lot of them hate me. the worst part is that this group of people are very good at holding grudges, which means that they will never forgive or forget.

 

afterthoughts of writing all this down;
i don't really know if i should even post this, nor do i know what i will do if it hits front page, but i doubt it will. this has really been some venting more than anything, but i feel like it fits tifu more than off my chest because of how much of a fuck up it was. i hope this brightens up somebodies sunday tomorrow if anyone even reads this. this may contain typos, especially because i'm on mobile and the g key area doesn't work for some reason. i'm relying on auto correct to spit out the right word, wish it luck.

    Here is the summary: You, a grade 11 student in an IB program, filled out a joke survey on a monitored school computer, causing the survey to become unavailable and potentially jeopardizing your class's assignment worth 25% of their grade
    


    You will be given one summary written for a news article. Your task is to rate the summary based on the following criteria:
    Output format: PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE

    Evaluation Criteria:
    1. Read the news article carefully and identify the main topic and key points.
    2. Read the summary and compare it to the news article. Check if the summary covers the main topic and key points of the news article, and if it resents them in a clear and logical order.
    3. Rate the summary with 5 percentages, where each one represents how likely the summary is going to get a score from 1 to 5. For example, if you think the summary is 80% likely to get a score of 5, 10% likely to get a score of 4, 5% likely to get a score of 3, 3% likely to get a score of 2, and 1% likely to get a score of 1, you should rate the summary as 80, 10, 5, 3, 2.

    Here is the article: a little bit of background info for this story. i'm in my school's grade eleven ib program, and there are two geography classes each containing ~25 kids. i am in class a, where we take it half of this year and half of next year, and the other half of grade eleven ib students are in the one that oes the full year. we both have to do an ia, which is essentially a big paper that both classes have to do. class a (my class) has to do one on t he topic of our choice using secondary data, and is worth 20% of our grade for this year. the other class is doing theirs on a local business and it's influence on the surrounding area. their paper is worth 25% of their grade and is sent off to ib hq, wherever that is. now on to the tifu part. 

as part of their data collection, they decide to do a survey. they all posted it on their facebook walls and encouraged everyone to participate. fast forward to ~3 weeks ago, where i get a "clever" idea. during computer science class, i go on to their survey, on a monitored and keylogged school computer, and fill out a joke survey. i was going to do it from home, but figured that i would forget it by then. i fill it out in the stupidest way possible, answering every question with the most ridiculous answer imaginable. i said that i lived across the country, i never have been there before, shopped there daily and went there exclusively for hand lotion. basically stupid shit like that. 

after i fill out, i click submit. after a while of waiting, i start refreshing the page. after about a minute of that, i exit the page and redo the survey. after i click submit, it states "the survey you have requested is no loner available or you are not allowed to participate," which i chalked up to me repeatedly trying to access the server and it getting pissy or something. i then proceed to forget all about it and move on with my life. a few of my other friends talked about how they filled out their own joke surveys too, my favorite being one where every answer was clicked other and typed in "insert student in class b"'s mom. 

later that week is when i realize the fuckup. i notice how everyone on facebook is getting complaints about the survey being down. i think nothing of it until i hear one of my friends from class b mention it. i put two and two together and realize what happened. this is the most logical explanation i could think up: i was sending a survey every time that i refreshed. i asked my friend if there was a limit as to how many surveys they could store, and he said 200. i don't know how many people actually did these surveys, but i would assume not many. what i just realized i did was spam a very important part of an assignment worth 25% of a whole class' grade with bs joke surveys. i quickly think up how to fix this without implicating myself, and did possibly one of the worst thins possible; i told my friend what happened.

this friend i told is a good guy, but he can not keep a secret. my logic was that he could mention to the teacher that the survey was down, and that they should make another, thus fixing the issue. instead, he tells everyone that i did it. now i have a whole half of the ib grade eleven, and apparently half of the grade 12 ib population who were relying on the survey too, hating my guts. word spread like wild fire and i had no idea what to do. everything seemed to die down for a while, and i thought that it may have blown over. i fiured that he must have tipped off the teacher to the problem and it was resolved, as no further news reached me about the situation. then one day someone from class b comes up and hands my class' teacher a thumb drive with the survey data. she was for some reason going to compile the data for the students. this made me double down on the belief that the survey had been fixed, as surely the teacher would have skimmed through to look for stuff like this. the next day when we were writing a test, my teacher stepped outside of the room to take a call. i heard the words "computer science" "survey" and "joke". i knew the jig was up.

i knew at this point that it was only a matter of time before i was caught, but i had a thin at lunch that i couldn't miss. i get to school every day ~45 minutes before first bell, so i figured that i could just tell her the next morning and save my lunch. then she gets another phone call and i knew she knew it was me. at bell, she asked me to stay behind for a few minutes. i instantly spilled the whole story and she seemed to believe it. at the end, she asked if i acted alone, and if i knew if anyone outside of the computer science class had done the same kind of thing. i so far had thrown 0 people under the bus, which i was very proud of. i took 110% responsibility for my part to play. i knew lots of people besides me where involved, but i sure as hell wasn't going to rat them out. i told her that i heard rumors of other people doing it, mainly outside of computer science. i told her very vague info and said that it was bound to happen when it was posted on facebook. she let me o 5 minutes in to lucnh, which was very nice.

how did she found out it was me? the friend i told to bring it up to the teacher told on me. the teacher of class b asked if anyone knew about the joke surveys and who did them, and he instantly said it was me. thanks bro. anyway, fast forward to the next day and i walk in to computer science. i go to log on to the computer and it states that my account "has expired or has been disabled, please see a system administrator," which i instantly knew was because of the survey. i have no idea how i am going to get through the rest of computer science without a computer, but whatever. then, my geo teacher walks in and tells us how we should be ashamed of screwing up the survey, and anyone responsible should come forward. every one turned and looked at me. she then left and class went on as usual. i noticed a dramatic shift in people and how they acted around and to me. they seemed to over night start hating me almost. everyone already knew that i did it, so i never understood why everyone was suddenly so pissed. 

i lived the next week almost in a constant state of being hated, which was...unique. i had to go talk to people about this whole charity thing for people without homes during the winter, and every class that was an ib one had people making snarky remarks to me. i didn't really care, i never have been one to get hurt by what people say. i only have a hand full of good friends in ib, most of them are outside of it. i guess looking back it is clear that i am way different from them, it was only a matter of time before they started hating me. i figured going in to ib if nothing else would get rid of the caddyness of people, but it really only made it worst. you'd figure a group full of the smartest people in school would be the least likely to be that way, but they are by far and large the worst. 

two days ago i found out why i had such a public opinion change; the original friend that i told decided to start this up again by telling everyone that not only did i do it, but i did it on purpose. i overheard him telling a group about how i maliciously did this, and i intervened. i walked up and told him that's not what happened, told them what did happen, and told my friend to stfu and talking like that could easily get me kicked out of ib. he got very defensive and i figured i wasn't going to change anything and walked away. 

i currently am in fear of what monday brings, as this friend is one of the best if not the best kid grades wise in ib, and is known for his honesty. if he tells my geo teacher, who is the head of my school's ib department, i will definitely be kicked out of ib, or at least denied my ib full diploma. i honestly have no idea what to do, and i feel like the enemies are at the gates.

    Here is the article: so i work in real estate, specifically property management, and i was doing a move-out inspection of one of our newly vacant townhomes. during my inspection my stomach sank and within moments i knew i was about to release a foul load to bless the house. thankfully the last tenants left a roll of toilet paper, so i had that going for me which was nice.

i was just about to finish up when my phone rang on the emergency number so i had to answer. i managed to quickly wipe, however, being in such a rush i simply belted my pants and answered the phone. well after a 10-15 minute long conversation i was finally free to flush the toilet...or not. i completely forgot and finished up the inspection locking the house behind me. 

hours later i get a call from one of our agents informing me that the toilet was disgusting and clearly there was a clog. quickly thinking i acted like i knew what she was talking and saw the clog. while i was bullshitting her the sweat poured down my face as i knew what took place. to make it even "worse" the homeowner e-mailed that he took care of the clog less than an hour later.

    Here is the article: this actually happened a couple of years ago, but i just read a different tifu story that reminded me of mine. so, with no further ado...


i used to sell drugs. molly, more specifically. i also dabbled in selling rolls (ecstasy), but not as much as molly. she was good to me. made me a lot of money. it also made me have a lot of fun and very popular among nightlife scenes. i like to think i was smart, so i frequently tested my drugs for their authenticity. i care about my friends and don't want to sell them bunk shit, of course. 

so one day, i pick up a new batch of powder for the upcoming weekend. it looked really good, but looks can be deceiving when it comes to drugs. i inspected it well and left, being satisfied. i decided to try a little of the powder when i got back to my house. capped out a half of a gram and swallowed it with some water. 

about 20 minutes later, i'm rolling. pretty hard. then after an hour i started getting twitchy and feel super anxious. three hours in, i decide whatever i picked up is not what i thought. that's when i went out and bought a test kit. the sample came out as methamphetamine. i was fucking pissed. i dumped the powder down the toilet. cost me $1,000. i got out of the drug game shortly after due to the threat of getting caught.

    Here is the article: i'll keep it as short as possible. this happened a few months ago. travelled to australia, bought a car with a friend, registered it in her name, travelled for a few months, arrived in sydney, decided to stay here for longer and sell the car.

because i found a full-time job she took it upon herself to sell the car. after not hearing anything for a month i decided to check in, she had no offers and was doing the best she could, ofcourse. now this was a good car, new, no mechanical problems, had just been checked, never any issues. because there was no real rush  i was fine with this explanation, although i didn't believe she was trying very hard.

another month goes by, still no sale or interest. come to find out she uses the car on a daily basis, long distance, and has only one advert online, where she's asking way to much money. i ask her if she really is interested in selling it, if not, she can buy me out since i'm not using the car or need it. she says she wants to sell it, so i help her by putting up adds myself. within a week i have 5 serious interests but since i'm working i have to thrust my friends to show the car. 

5 car inspections later still nobody showed interest in buying. i call one of the people that came to look at the car back to ask why not, only to find out my friend said the engine was making weird noises and the clutch was worn out. he also tells me the 'engine warning sign' on the dashboard is on, which wasn't before. she ofcourse has a great excuse, i forgot what it is, and i give her one last chance to sell it. 

by now almost 12 weeks have gone by and i'm planning on flying to cairns, however we need to sell the car first. i tell her i'm taking over (which was met with an unreasonable amount of hostility), pick up the car from her house, bring it to the garage, get it fixed (new brakes, new clutch cylinders, get the engine warning sign fixed and a few other small things), i clean the car (which hadn't been done in forever) and put it online. next day the police, and her, stand in front of my door with questions about me selling a stolen car. 

after the shock subsided i calmly explain the story the the cops while showing proof of my half of the payment. she says she wants the keys to the car because her name is on the contract, i just want to sell the car. the officers are frustrated to the point of anger that she lied and got them involved in a civil dispute where she had never made an attempt to discus it among outselves. after a long discussion where she's making up things to get her way (i'm depressed and will drive the car of a cliff, i never said the car should be sold, i can't be trusted and won't pay her her half) they decide she gets the keys with the promise of selling the car a.s.a.p. and giving me my half. 

now, 6 months later, realization has set in i lost the car. she blocked me on all possible platforms but still owns the car. i called the police but they can't do anything because the car is in her name. i have to leave australia soon so going to court will be taking to long next to being expensive. i'm all out of options, bye bye $3200 (and 'friendship').

    Here is the article: first of all, i work in a fairly small office and i am one of the most recent hires. 

today, i was (and still am) working on compiling a fairly detailed report. i was on a roll and really getting shit done it when i realized i needed information from a folder in my desk. of course, i broke my finger nail retrieving it. i chipped just enough of my right-hand pointer finger nail to make typing excruciatingly irritating. if i could just file the nail down, as fast as possible, i could get right back into this report without missing a beat. but, as luck would have it, i don't have a nail file with me. previously in situations like this, i would just use my jeans - they make great nail files. ever resourceful, i notice the zipper on my pants looks like it might do the trick, so i go for it. 

just as i am quickly running my pointer fingernail up and down my zipper, i had that "someone is looking at me" feeling, and just as i looked up, i made eye contact with a coworker who had been walking past my office. this person did a quick double-take, then continued briskly walking. only then did i realize what rubbing my hand in my crotch must have looked like. and it doesn't help that my office is hot so my face is a little red.

now i feel like i should go have an awkward "i was not masturbating at work" conversation or something. but, i can type again, so i got that going for me, which is nice.

    Here is the summary: You were working on a report when you realized you needed information from a folder in your desk, but when you retrieved it, you chipped your right-hand pointer finger nail and had to use your zipper as a makeshift nail file

    Here is the article: so this one happened this morning, probably more embarrassing but it was none the less an f-up. my wife was having outpatient surgery on her wrist and we were back in pre-op waiting for her to be taken into surgery. she gets really nauseous from the 'feel good meds' so the nurse warned her that one of the medicines would make her feel like she has "ants in your pants". sure enough, when she did get the medicine, she started complaining. i assumed it was a sensation all over like when your foot falls asleep and you can feel it up your leg. any time my wife's foot falls asleep i like to squeeze it to make her laugh. this was what i assumed by "ants in your pants"/
so i make the comment, "oh, let me press on it". the nurse gives me this look from hell and says, "sir, i don't think you need to touch her privates". apparently, it the lady parts that tingle, not the legs. there i am with a damn derp face trying to explain i thought it was her legs, not her lady parts. 
next time a nurse comes, its a different one. everyone who came see my wife from that point forward looked at me and giggled.

    Here is the article: obligatory "did not happen today", but rather about 8 years ago in college. 

i was a freshman in college at a huge party school, and a number of my friends and i had had a good night out on the town, and decided to round out the night drinking some beers in our dorm room. being that we were broke college kids our beer of choice (or circumstance) was called "beer 30 light". it came in purple can and was $11 for a 30-rack. our fridge was full of it. anyway, we're just hanging out, watching super troopers cranked up to 11, and just minding our own business. 

meanwhile, down the hall, some guys are smoking some weed in their room. thinking they're being stealthy with the whole "dryer sheet in a bottle" filter method, they are proceeding to stink up the entire floor. being that they're nervous about being caught, they're not making a peep. 

back to our room, i proceed to liven up the party and suggest we start shotgunning beers. i prep my can of beer 30 light to shotgun, and just as i'm about to do so, we hear a loud pounding at the door. *boom boom boom*. thinking that its just our buddy returning from the bathroom, my roommate expertly delivers the line from beerfest and demands: "da passvord!!". the voice answers from the other side of the door in an authoritative tone: "university police." we look at each other in drunken bewilderment, simultaneously dismiss it as being our buddy trying to play a trick on us, and say to ourselves: "bullshittt." i stumble over the door, prepped beer in hand, and swing it open. there stands a university police officer in the threshold. he looks me up and down, spots the beer in my hand, and radios in "yeah we're gonna need some more guys up here." 

fuck.

apparently there was some roaming ra/security (aka cockbag) that was patrolling the building at night, smelled the weed, got spooked, and called the cops. when the cops arrive, they deem our room as being the primary suspect due to how loud we had the tv, and investigate. 

we get accused of smoking weed (which we weren't) but they proceed to tear our entire room apart looking for it. they find our fake ids, our large supply of shitty purple piss-beer, write us up for underage consumption, make fun of our beer choice, and supervise us pouring our watery beer can-by-can down the dorm's bathroom sink. 150 hours of community service later it ends up as a funny, embarrassing story.

    Here is the summary: A group of college freshmen had a wild night of drinking and partying in their dorm room, but their fun was disrupted when a University Police officer arrived at their door, accused them of smoking weed, and searched their room for evidence

    Here is the article: this actually happened about a few days ago so yeah...

i'm 17 years old and just graduated from high school ( i am not from the us ). i got a job for a (rather small) catering company about 2 months ago so i could get funds for steam winter sale and maybe upgrade my gaming rig.

most of the time, i just get assigned to attend the events we catered for cleaning up the table and sending out the food. since christmas was coming and me living in an islamic country ( i'm muslim ), some of the christian employees got early paid leave including the boss herself while i got reassigned to helping the cook.

this was the last event we are going to cater for before leaving for christmas and the food supplies were well enough for the event's lunch and dinner except for breakfast. oh also the event organizer ordered to cater for around 50 pax. (this is vital). the "*second-in-command*" cook (let's call him jeff) told me to buy some bread so he could make sandwiches for the event's breakfast and also told me not to buy whole meal breads. so, i drive to the wholesaler's place and grabbed the nearest bread i could see on the shelf without looking at the brand and bought 40 loaves of them. i came back and gave jeff those breads.

so there i was helping him make the sandwiches and also almost finished when suddenly the "*commanding*" cook comes to our table to check on us. when he saw those sandwiches we made, i swear i could hear my ear ringing. he shouted at us like we just killed his son in front of him for using whole meal bread and i'm just sitting here thinking if i had just made jeff lost his job (thankfully no) while he throws a tantrum from which a 3 year old wouldn't even be a able to compare with.

he threw away the sandwiches we just made down on the floor and stepped on it multiple times.^(damn, all those hard work for nothing) some words like "*piece of shit can't even do a simple job*" and "are you fucking deaf?*" were even thrown at us as he leaves us alone. so, it appears that the *second-in-command* cook here also did not know a single thing about types of bread.

i left from then on and didn't gave a fuck about my weekly (also last) salary. to make sure i didn't fucked up jeff's career that much, i took one for the team. i let jeff lied about having me telling him that it was okay for us to use whole meal anyways.

note: i am well aware of subway and i have **always** chosen *wrapped* for my options. also, it's late night here and i'm off to sleep so i won't be replying to you for a few hours.

 

edit: added tl;dr

    Here is the summary: As a 17-year-old high school graduate working for a small catering company, I was tasked with buying bread for an event but ended up using the wrong type (whole meal instead of white), which enraged the head cook and resulted in him throwing away all the sandwiches we made and berating us with hurtful language

    Here is the article: naturally, just like most of the posts on this sub this magical event happened a couple of years ago.

it was my senior year of high school. at this point i've been living in the us for 3.5 years and i was a pretty good kid, until the start of the senior year, of course. that is when all the drinking and smoking started. at a certain point during that year i have developed a habit of smoking a cigarette and having some jack daniels on my porch. this habit would be celebrated religiously at least a couple of times a week.

now, i have to mention that besides smoking cigarettes i would occasionally (like once a month occasionally) partake in smoking some trees with my buddies.

well, on one beautiful afternoon my m8 brings this wonderful brownie to class. i knew that this was not just any regular brownie as we've been wanting to have such a brownie for quite some time now and the opportunity presented itself. regardless, we split the brownie in two and each of us consumes his respective half. 45 minutes pass. i'm high as a motherfucker.

at this point a week has passed after i had that brownie (i strongly recommend, you people, to be really careful with the edibles - i can post the whole story if there's demand). a week has passed and i'm chilling on my porch on a warm thursday afternoon. i have cigarette in my left hand and a glass of honey jack in my right. i finish the cig and suddenly i hear a knock on the door. at this point the realization hits me that the door to the porch was left open and all the smoke got sucked inside the house. i quickly pour down the rest of the jack into the kitchen sink and go to open the door and see my mother who came back early that day. to make a long story short: she quickly realizes that i was the one that was smoking. having never seen me drunk or caught me smoking before she flipped her shit. sweet jesus was it bad! she swore to me that she will test me for every drug there is out there because she didn't know how far i've gotten in my experiments.

now, in the place where i'm from weed and heroin are viewed equally by the society. even this does not describe how scared shitless i was when i heard the "every drug" phrase come out of her mouth.

the first thing that i did when everyone went to sleep was to look up all the possible methods of detox there are, seeing as a i had a fat ass brownie a week before. not having any personal income the only solution that seemed optimal to me was to chug water like i've been on a hike through sahara desert for the past month.

lo and behold teenage me sitting in every single class, getting weird looks from people as i try my hardest to empty a bottle of water as frequently as i can. the amount of pee that ran out of me over the course of the next three days was enough to power a small hydroelectric plant.

thankfully, my mother did not go through with the testing and i remained in the clear.

at this point a week has passed after i had that brownie (i strongly recommend, you people, to be really careful with the edibles - i can post the whole story if there's demand). a week has passed and i'm chilling on my porch on a warm thursday afternoon. i have cigarette in my left hand and a glass of honey jack in my right. i finish the cig and suddenly i hear a knock on the door. at this point the realization hits me that the door to the porch was left open and all the smoke got sucked inside the house. i quickly pour down the rest of the jack into the kitchen sink and go to open the door and see my mother who came back early that day. to make a long story short: she quickly realizes that i was the one that was smoking. having never seen me drunk or caught me smoking before she flipped her shit. sweet jesus was it bad! she swore to me that she will test me for every drug there is out there because she didn't know how far i've gotten in my experiments.

now, in the place where i'm from weed and heroin are viewed equally by the society. even this does not describe how scared shitless i was when i heard the "every drug" phrase come out of her mouth.

the first thing that i did when everyone went to sleep was to look up all the possible methods of detox there are, seeing as a i had a fat ass brownie a week before. not having any personal income the only solution that seemed optimal to me was to chug water like i've been on a hike through sahara desert for the past month.

lo and behold teenage me sitting in every single class, getting weird looks from people as i try my hardest to empty a bottle of water as frequently as i can. the amount of pee that ran out of me over the course of the next three days was enough to power a small hydroelectric plant.

thankfully, my mother did not go through with the testing and i remained in the clear.

    You will be given one summary written for a news article. Your task is to rate the summary based on the following criteria:
    Output format: PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE

    Evaluation Criteria:
    1. Read the news article carefully and identify the main topic and key points.
    2. Read the summary and compare it to the news article. Check if the summary covers the main topic and key points of the news article, and if it resents them in a clear and logical order.
    3. Rate the summary with 5 percentages, where each one represents how likely the summary is going to get a score from 1 to 5. For example, if you think the summary is 80% likely to get a score of 5, 10% likely to get a score of 4, 5% likely to get a score of 3, 3% likely to get a score of 2, and 1% likely to get a score of 1, you should rate the summary as 80, 10, 5, 3, 2.

    Here is the article: whelp, i have been a lurker for months but i have finally had a fuck up that is worthy of posting.  this fuck-up actually happened about an hour ago, but like all good tifu's, it is the accumulation of multiple fu's.

in june immediately after i finished my freshman year, i visited an older sister who was still in school (i am also in college), and i had had a significant hiatus in drinking because i was in season for track.  that weekend was also the weekend of my sister's sorority "formal" where everyone gets dressed up and usually gets a party bus all that jazz.  now i should mention that the only suit that i own is one passed down from my father as a gift when i graduated high school, an upper end ralph lauren suit, over $1,000 when including the shoes.  it also has sentimental value bc my dad is a doctor and wore it years and years to many medical conferences and the like, and bought it for himself once he graduated from residency.  giving that suit to me was a big deal bc it was the most thoughtful and by far the most expensive gift i have ever received, and also because i dreamed of using that suit for my medical school interviews.  so i suppose the first mistake would be wearing my prize possession to a night out of shannaigans.

so back to the party: all is well, but i am a tad more drunk than i intend to be, and as the night progresses, i over estimate how much my body can handle. by the end of the night we have to head back to campus, i am in real rough shape.  i puke out the window of the car we were in, but unfortunately the flak takes my suit down as well as a few unsuspecting bystanders.  wake up the next morning hungover and slightly pissed that i have to get my suit dry cleaned-- but all is well because i had a fun night and it was my fault.  

i am in an unknown city so i just go to the nearest hole in the wall dry cleaner.  i suppose this is my second mistake by not checking reviews on the place because if i had i would have seen that they had less than 2 stars (for what that's worth).  i have a plane flight the next morning so i grab it on my way to the airport and it has my tag on it and the right tie and the same color, ect. but i don't bother checking to make sure it was my actual suit.  probably my biggest fu. throw it in my suit carrier that is within my suitcase and forget about it for 3 months (until today).

open the suit bag about an hour ago, and it looks a bit....off.  so i put on the coat and it feels...for the lack of a better term...like a cheap suit.  check the inside of the coat, and it does not have the usual branding that i was used to, but instead it said "merona."  quick google search tells me that this is not in fact my suit, but a 30 dollar coat from target. (something like this: https://www.target.com/c/suits-men-s-clothing/merona/-/n-5xu20z4ynan).  uh oh. stomach drops to the floor. 

after i finished my panic attack i plan on calling the store in the am, but as of right now it looks pretty bleak guys.

 

and as someone who is a chronic skeptic, i will also include a pic of the suit, because that is the only form of "evidence" i have to show that this actually happened. https://imgur.com/a/jdxmc

    Here is the summary: The author had a series of mishaps involving their expensive Ralph Lauren suit, starting with wearing it to a party and getting it covered in vomit, then accidentally bringing a cheap Target coat instead of their own suit to the airport, and only realizing the mistake three months later

    Here is the article: ok so i was walking around the back of the warehouse i work at a while back, and there is a dumpster. i was throwing some boxes away. all of a sudden i hear a sound in the dumpster. it sort of sounded like scratching.
 
   i look into the dumpster and it is pretty empty, except there is a frickin squirrel inside. this thing is wigging out, trying to escape, but it cant.
me being the dumb animal lover i am. i decide to jump into this dumpster and pick the little guy up and let him go. you know maybe i was hoping he would become my best friend, and first chance at reddit gold, but i digress.

  i jump into the dumpster and calmly grab the squirrel on it's back, and when i begin to pick it up, the thing goes wild and bites down...hard... on my finger. i am shacking my hand violently trying to loosen its grip, but no...its still on my finger. about this time, i am wondering what went wrong. finally, it releases but only because my skin ripped! 

  for everyone wondering, it made it out of the dumpster because i flung it free.  i had to go get stitches and a tetnis shot, because the doctor said i might have gotten rabies!

    Here is the article: this happened yesterday/today
i'll cut it short: went to a bar to celebrate last day of work the next day, was talked into going to a club by a lithuanian ex-military and his finnish friend, getting drinks for free cause the lithuanian guy kept offering, had so many fucking double whiskeys, called emergency service 3 fucking times cause i thought i lost my passport (had it in my pocket the entire time), going home somehow, breaking a glass and stepping all over the shards, losing my phone (which i found eventually), and waking up at 11am while work started at 8. i'm now at the office, still fucking drunk. someone help me, this isn't how the last day is supposed to go.. my boss has been looking at me strange the entire time i've been here.

 

update: it's 1pm now, still drunk, hiding in an ad-hoc room and eating oranges.

update: it's 1:30pm, forced to interact with my employee, at least he can understand half the words i'm saying so there's progress

update: it's 2pm, still drunk, had to talk with coworkers, awkwardly left mid-conversation to hide in bathroom for hopes of sobering up. note to self: write a book.

update: it's 2:30pm, no more oranges to be found.

update: it's 3pm, went outside for a cig with my boss as he was leaving early, had a hearty conversation with him, and as he left, he turned and said '.. i won't tell anyone, but drink less.' - i didn't know how to respond so i kind of walked away.

update: it's 4pm, i'm home, took forever with hr and it and reception to sort out my leaving. buying oranges soon.

    Here is the article: so this actually happened 8 years ago when i was in high school, but it wasn't until today before i finally found the courage to talk about it.

everything started as a normal day of school. i would have 6 classes, with a break in between every two classes. after arriving at school however, a pleasant surprise awaited me. the 5th class was cancelled, so my second break was extended by 50 minutes. naturally i didn't waste this time with self-study (the recommendation of the school), but decided to spend this time outside. 

i went to the library to grab a copy of a book i was reading at home, and stopped at the cafeteria to get a bottle of soda. once outside, i sat down and started to read. after a few chapters, i heard the buzzer, signaling the end of the classes, and realized i completely lost track of time. because this the next teacher was very strict, i quickly rushed towards my next class, french. upon arriving, the teacher was just about to close the doors and urged me to get inside the classroom. 

feeling lucky to have avoided detention for being too late, i sat down and looked at the schedule. we were supposed to be reading some sentences and articles and listen to the teacher reading them out aloud before repeating them, in order to practice the pronunciation. after awhile, some classmates started laughing about one of the sentences and made fun of each other. after several warnings of the teacher, one of them was told to leave the classroom and report to his coordinator for interrupting the class. it was then when i realized i forgot to go to the restrooms before joining the class, and put up my hand to ask for permission. when the teacher saw this, she told me to wait with my question until we finished the current article.

when we finished the article, i once more tried asking for permission to leave for the restrooms, but the teacher answered with a firm "no, you should have done that before we started this class.", and continued with the next article. i decided to try to hold it until the end of the class, which was only 15 more minutes, only to realize about 10 minutes later, that it wasn't going to be an option, since i really had to go right now. i once more put up my hand to ask for permission, but this time the teacher completely ignored me. 

by now, things started to get bad, really bad. i didn't know what to do, and still shocked by the firm no i had gotten the first time, i decided not to do anything. of course my body did not completely agree with this, and slowly i felt my underwear getting a little wet. with my hand still held up, i decided to wave a little, and make direct eye contact. no response. 

when finally the buzzer for the end of the class sounded, it was too late. under my chair was now a small puddle. relieved by the buzzer, i ran to the toilet, tried to clean my pants, waited till the corridors were mostly empty, and then went home. once there, i quickly changed my clothes and tried to imagine what would happen the next day. surely someone must have noticed the puddle, or so i thought. 

the next day i was prepared for the worst. when i arrived at school, i was expecting to be laughed at, mocked, being called names or even worse, but nothing happened, not even a question or a reference to the "incident" of the previous day. amazed by this, i continued my classes, but from that moment on, i never skipped a restroom break.

the only reference to this incident i ever noticed was not until a few weeks later, when a classmate in another class of another teacher asked to go to the toilet. the teacher responded with, "sure, i wouldn't want you to wet your pants." a few other classmates chuckled and the class continued. 

right now, 8 years later, i'm still wondering if anyone knew what exactly had happened that day, and if the answer of this other teacher was a coincidence or a deliberate reference.

    Here is the summary: The author, who was in high school 8 years ago, shares a humorous and embarrassing experience where they accidentally wet their pants during a French class due to a combination of factors such as forgetting to go to the restroom before class, being ignored by the teacher when asking for permission to leave, and holding it in for too long

    Here is the article: like most posts on this sub, this actually happened yesterday. i will start off with some back story. i am in the navy and am an it guy in a small office building. i am friends with a high ranking civilian that i will refer to as mr. bossman who is basically 5 or 6 rungs up the ladder from me in the hierarchy at my job. to put this into perspective he is my supervisor's boss's manager's boss's manager's boss. we became friends because we both happen to be 2 of the 4 smokers out of the whole building and take smoke breaks at pretty much the same time everyday. this eventually turned into us deliberately smoking at the same time so we could bullshit about what is going on at the job and the latest episode of breaking bad or game of thrones. 


yesterday we were talking about how he is stressed about his position and i said "at least you don't have to deal with mcpillheadguy anymore." some backstory on mcpillheadguy is he was a new guy who come to work with us last year. he popped on a drug test but due to some miracle managed to actually stay in the navy which is pretty rare nowadays. due to cutbacks in military spending and force reduction plans, they pretty much kick you out for anything, especially drugs. well, a month or two ago mcpillheadguy went and popped on another drug test, this time he was done for sure which is a pretty big relief because that kind of stuff is stressful to deal with for the upper chain of command, they have to fill out a ton of paperwork and it makes them look like they can't keep their people in line. fast forward two hours and i receive a building-wide email from my captain, i will copy and paste it below:


team *censored*,

    Here is the article: this actually happened today! basically had someone over last night who i thought was a friend, he got really pushy despite many "no's". i ended up saying "i'm tired gotta go to sleep" and going to my bedroom and lock the door. i felt too bad to say "effin' stop, and leave" and was going through nice things he had done in my head in the past, but i was a bit scared and didn't sleep well last night.
at 1 a.m. i decided to make a snapchat for only 2 people to see on my list of about 6-7 people. in the settings you can make it so that only certain people see your "main story" snap, and you could see who watches them.
the snap was black and basically read, "really uncomfortable :( trust ur gut.."
as you guessed, wake up to see he's the only one who viewed it. turns out by selecting usernames you make it so they can't see. he'a gone now and hasn't said anything. :/ just feel all sorts of weird.

 
edit: words

    Here is the summary: The author had a negative experience with a friend who became pushy and disrespectful of their boundaries, leading to a sleepless night and a Snapchat message expressing their discomfort

    Here is the article: ok this happened 10 days ago when i ordered the ipad pro online, to be delivered by ups.  

last monday, i went to ups to pick up the package.  to my dismay, they declared the package was lost and asked me to contact apple.  

**day 1, 12/1**.  contacted apple cs.  they told me a replacement order will be sent to me, by 12/5 saturday (yesterday), because i need the ipad pro for a business trip.  the rep reassured me this will not be a problem, and that within 24 hours, i will get an email with the replacement order.  (so far so good)

**next day, 12/2.**  contacted apple cs chat again since no replacement order was sent.  the rep again assured me that it will happen in 24 hours, and then they can overnight the ipad pro to me by friday so that i can make my trip w/ it (ok....)

**12/3** got replacement order, but the delivery date shows 10 days from then, not overnight.  contacted cs because this will be long past my trip.  at this time, the ipad is finally in stock so i offered to pick it up in person.  i can finally get my ipad before the trip and happy holiday to me, right?  not according to apple cs rep:

"can you escalate the order so that i can get it overnight?" "nope"
"can someone from store overnight the ipad to me?" "our system doesn't talk to the store"
"ok, then can you change the replacement order to store pick up?" "our system doesn't talk to the store".  

wut!?  the customer tried to make it easy for the team by offering to drive 30 minutes to the store to pick up an item that's currently in stock, but you do not allow him to do so.  but wait, there's "one more thing".

according to the rep, the best solution is to cancel the replacement order and repurchase the item from the store.  

"ok.  but i ordered the item via a gift card.  will i get the refund fast enough so i can use the proceed immediately?  i need the ipad in 2 days you know?"
"yes the gift card will be there in 24 hours and the credit card portion will take 3-5 days to show up".
"ok then!"

**12/4.** replacement order cancelled, but still no gift card refund.  contacted cs and again he assured me i will get a new gift card email in 24 hours *(lies!)*

**12/5 (yesterday)** still no refund.  cs says it's in processed, and it will take 3-5 days. *(wut!?  after repeatedly promised that i will get the ipad by today for my business trip, the best answer i get is it's in process!?  if i knew i wouldn't have fucked up and cancel the replacement order in the first place!)*

**12/6 (just now)**:  called cs.  same answer, and bonus point they hanged up on me.  *(i think i have been blacklisted by apple.) *

obviously this has been a super frustrating experience.  the worse fuck up part of this is, apple doesn't have to fix any of these.  reality is no matter what the outcome, i would still buy the ipad pro, and that chances are when they release the ipad pro 2, 3, 4..., i will still buy them.  the situation is that fucked up!  

**ps:**  apple cs really sucks...maybe even worse than at&t's and comcast's.  at least a&t and comcast would be openly rude to you.  apple cs pretends to treat you nice and lies to you instead, so that they can get a favorable cs review.

"ok.  but i ordered the item via a gift card.  will i get the refund fast enough so i can use the proceed immediately?  i need the ipad in 2 days you know?"
"yes the gift card will be there in 24 hours and the credit card portion will take 3-5 days to show up".
"ok then!"

**12/4.** replacement order cancelled, but still no gift card refund.  contacted cs and again he assured me i will get a new gift card email in 24 hours *(lies!)*

**12/5 (yesterday)** still no refund.  cs says it's in processed, and it will take 3-5 days. *(wut!?  after repeatedly promised that i will get the ipad by today for my business trip, the best answer i get is it's in process!?  if i knew i wouldn't have fucked up and cancel the replacement order in the first place!)*

**12/6 (just now)**:  called cs.  same answer, and bonus point they hanged up on me.  *(i think i have been blacklisted by apple.) *

obviously this has been a super frustrating experience.  the worse fuck up part of this is, apple doesn't have to fix any of these.  reality is no matter what the outcome, i would still buy the ipad pro, and that chances are when they release the ipad pro 2, 3, 4..., i will still buy them.  the situation is that fucked up!  

**ps:**  apple cs really sucks...maybe even worse than at&t's and comcast's.  at least a&t and comcast would be openly rude to you.  apple cs pretends to treat you nice and lies to you instead, so that they can get a favorable cs review.

    Here is the summary: The author purchased an iPad Pro online and was told it would be delivered by UPS, but when they went to collect the package, UPS declared it was lost and asked them to contact Apple

    Here is the article: this story is not about taking alchohol with painkillers, since i probably wouldn't be here, and i'm too young for that, but anyways.

during a normal day of playing on my computer for 6-7 hours straight (not healthy for me) i get a headache. not a mild headache, like a headsplitting, brain cancer inducing headache. it hurt, a lot, to the point where sleeping doesn't fix it (how i usually get rid of headaches). so i decide to go downstairs, and take some painkillers. once i got to the bottle of painkillers, i thought that i was some invincible, superhuman, kind of person who can just take the painkillers without drinking water, which was probably, the most fatal mistake i have ever done. thing is, the pills were **tiny**, like minuscule size, that is why i thought of the great idea of not taking water with it.

so i put one pill in my mouth, while not realizing that i was in for some adventure. the instant i swallowed it, it felt like i drank some sand, that was like formed into a rock, and then dried for like 13 hours in a dryer. throat felt like a desert, it was so dry i coughed like 10 times before going for the nearest glass in the vicinity, still coughing like a 150 year old man. once i actually got some water in my system, it was too late, the damage has already done.

after about drinking 13 truckloads of water, throat still felt like a wasteland desert, and the headache became much, much worse. so, i went to my computer, started talking to my friends on skype, trying my best not to cough every 15 nanoseconds. after about 9pm, i was basically wasted, my head felt like a nuclear reactor about to combust into flames, throat felt like death valley, and coughed as if hurricane katrina just left by body, and all because i took some painkillers like a true champion.

    Here is the summary: After taking some painkillers without drinking enough water, I experienced a terrible and hilarious adventure, including a dry and painful throat, a worsened headache, and uncontrollable coughing fits

    Here is the article: so, this is back when i was in about sixth grade. we had a student teacher (can't remember his name) and he was a really nice guy. like, him and i would give each other banter and shit. anyway, i remember this one lunchtime (where we eat lunch inside our classrooms) where he was chatting to some of my friends. i noticed that his underwear was showing from the top of his pants, and they superman underwear. literally, like they had the superman symbol on them and everything. i call out "nice superman underwear!" he turns around and my friends and almost the entire class start laughing. like, there are kids in stitches, pointing at the poor guys superman underwear. 
i thought my student teacher would laugh as well, but he looked really upset. he made me sit on another table on the other side of the classroom for the rest of lunch. i had to eat my lunch alone, and he kept looking over at me, beet red. i felt sorry for the guy, and thought about apologizing, but a few days later, he left.

    Here is the article: this happened last night but i've had some kind of paralyzing shame until now.  my brother works at a sales job and the last friday of every month they have a big drink up at the bar near their office.  it's an open bar to pretty much anyone who says, "oh yeah, i'm with the company."  so i usually end up showing up and we hang out and get super drunk.  nothing in this world feels quite as amazing as getting sloppy for free.

this night my brother and i were being our usual jackass selves to each other: one of us would go grab a round of shots and chasers (usually the high life, we keep it classy).  and the jackassery is that we always try to get a worse shot than the last one.  so we went jack, don julio, lunazul, wild turkey (gobble gobble), old crow.  and a beer with each to boot.

it was at this point that it was my turn to go to the bar.  i order two shots of midori, which i thought would have won the game, to which a very cute girl says, "double fisting, huh?  bold."  or something to that effect.  i give her my most dapper smile and say, "well god gave me two hands for a reason."  it was around that time that my eyes made their customary once over of this girl's body, and it was a great body too, until they stopped very suddenly.

this girl only had one hand.

this girl, who i had actually met before at one of these drink ups, was born with one hand and one nub.  i stood there just shellshocked for a second and then went into super apologizer mode.  i did everything short of prostrating myself in front of her.  to my incredible luck, she had lived through 28 years of this sort of thing and was a very good sport about it.  i offered to buy her a drink and that eventually diffused the tension (open bar, remember), but the rest of the night, everyone who was within earshot looked at me like i was a damn serial killer.

    Here is the summary: The author went to a drink up at their brother's workplace and made a shameful mistake by making a comment about double fisting shots, not realizing that the girl they were talking to had only one hand

    Here is the article: i was once in a 2 week creative writing workshop for people ages 13-17. as you can imagine, everyone in it was completely insufferable, including me. i didn’t know everyone’s names that well and couldn’t match names to faces. we read one story for workshop the next day by “kelly”.

a girl started talking to me at lunch. she talked a lot. i eventually phased out and mechanically started answering everything she said with an affirmative. she looked down at the story we’d read and proclaimed, “i hate this story.” i thoughtlessly agreed, “yeah, i didn’t like it very much either, it wasn’t very good.”

she ran off and cried in the bathroom for 30 minutes. i’ll let you guess what her name was.

    Here is the article: **this is my first post to /r/tifu. sorry if i made any errors.**
------------------------------------------------------------
my parents & my sister had come to visit me at my apartment home from another state. we had decided to go to the park because we thought the weather would be good that weekend... until it happened.

we were at the park, me playing basketball with my dad and the rest of our family at the picnic table, until the clouds started forming. we thought nothing of it and continued to go on with our game. then the rain started dropping and it was starting to rain even harder when we got to our car. this is when problems started happening.

i had ridden my bicycle to the park because it couldn't fit into our car and i had my phone with me. my dad had volunteered to ride the bike home in the rain since he was used to it. (it rained in the city he lived in a lot) he headed off, but there was a problem. 

the car was completely refusing to move. we had tried every solution but it wouldn't budge, even if we tried changing gears. we were panicky and tried calling after my dad, but he had already gone off. we tried texting him, but he had left his phone in the car. fuck. my mother and sister said that *i* should go run after him in the hellstorm that we were experiencing right now.

i went off and ran after him as fast as i could, slipping quite a couple of times. it had been two whole minutes before my sister came, driving down the road saying that **my dad forgot to fully start the fucking ignition.**

now here i am, completely soaked typing this up. i also realized that my phone was in my completely-soaked pocket the whole entire fucking time.

    Here is the summary: You and your family went to the park, but the rain started and your dad volunteered to ride your bike home while the rest of you tried to leave in the car, but the car refused to move and you had to run after your dad in the rain

 on wednesday night, 6 days into our 9 day long trip, we both got drunk off moonshine and my boyfriend told me that we were 4 hours away from a town in alabama that was the feature in a podcast which i remember him being really obsessed with in the beginning of our relationship. the podcast is "s-town", as i'm sure many of you have listened to it and connected with john b as my boyfriend did. so that night we decided on a whim to drive the 4 hours, explore "s-town" in all its shitty glory and find a camping spot there for the evening. 

the next morning we made the drive while listening to "s-town" the whole way there. we went to k3 lumber yard, john b's gravesite, his house and even looked for tyler's tattoo shop to no avail. it was nearing dusk so we found a nice state park to camp in for the evening. we managed to get our site set up before dark and started a fire before i set up the camp stove and made some soup. 

a few beers in we attempted to make jiffy pop because we were still hungry and burned the bottom. it's around 11:30pm now and i figured "no matter the jiffy pop! i'll just make us some ramen!" well, i didn't put on the lantern because i figured the fire provided me with enough light to cook something as easy as ramen. as soon as the water was boiling i plunked the noodles in and sat down on the picnic bench to stir. 

the picnic table shook and the pot of boiling water spilled onto my stomach and thighs. i launched back from the table screaming in pain and ripped off my t-shirt and nylon running shorts out of fear they would melt to my skin. my boyfriend comes running and pours cool water on me before shining a light to reveal my skin literally sliding off my body. we both agree that i needed to go to a hospital so we attempt to get in the car but we cannot find the keys anywhere! reacting quickly, my boyfriend runs to get a park ranger (our phones are out of range) who then calls me an ambulance.

because we are literally in shittown alabama, it takes about 45 mins for the ambulance to show up and another 45 mins to reach the burn unit. finally managed to get some morphine after writhing in pain for nearly 2 hours and burning off 30% of my skin. i spent 3 days in the uab trauma center and got my bandages off 1 week later. i've been told the burns will take about a year to fully heal. 

 

edit; this has been really hard for me, i am only comfortable enough with the reality of the accident now to post about it. please don't be a jerk, it's enough i'll probably have permeant scaring from one mistake.

    Here is the summary: While on a road trip with my Canadian boyfriend in the American South, I accidentally spilled boiling water on myself, causing third-degree burns to my stomach and thighs

    Here is the article: happened this morning, i got up early to relieve myself before retreating back into the warm safety of bed, not uncommon. unfortunately today i was extra sleepy and thought i could auto pilot back from the toilet with my eyes closed, this includes a couple small turns, and i've only lived here a month.

desperate for sleep i jumped onto the bed, my knee touched first, then i realized mid flight my arm had yet to land on anything... opening my eyes i see ive over shot my destination and my mouth is about to break my fall,  over the top back edge of my foldout desk chair. after collapsing in a heap i sat in stunned disbelief at my own stupidity for a few moments before deciding i'm still way to tired for this shit. currently have cuts and minor swelling on the inside of my top and bottom lips as a reminder of my shame.

    Here is the summary: This morning, I got up early to use the bathroom and then return to bed, but I was extra sleepy and tried to auto-pilot my way back without opening my eyes, leading to me overshooting my destination and falling onto my desk chair

    Here is the article: i was sitting at my desk at work when i begin to feel this...well, this disruptive gurgle in my gut. eh, whatever, it should go away, i deal with this everyday (my diet sucks). well, i have a meeting in about 15 min....buuuuut i bet it will be gone by then, usually goes away if i just tough it out. 

uhhhh, no. within seconds my stomach begins to churn worse. i'm breathing in and out heavily, trying to relax my body enough to rid my guts of this pain caused by fowl shit and methane build up which i can tell is rapidly building like a time-lapsed cloud front moving in. 

i begin to feel hot, then cold, then hot and sweaty again. as i sit there hoping it's going to go away, i'm approached by the co-worker (higher up but not my boss) i have a meeting with. "oh hey jdubstrut, can we get together now?"
i'm fucking sweating bullets, my face is red and my fucking gut feels like it has 18 pounds of liquid shit i need to get rid of. 

me-"can i have a few min. to run to the bathroom"? 
her-"sure come find me in my office when you're ready".

whew, i dodged that bullet. well at this point i know i'm in the danger zone (kenny loggins). it's no longer in my gut, it's actually migrated itself into to last few inches of my butthole wanting to come out. i scramble across the building to the closest bathroom. 

let me add some context here, the bathroom door is literally no more than 10 feet away from a cubicle pod full of women. i've been in and out of this bathroom hundreds of times and they never pay attention to who goes in or who comes out.---remember this.

i pull the door open and use my hand on the handle for leverage to throw myself in the bathroom and into the stall. i pull my pants down and boom, before my ass cheeks even hit the lid it's like someone turned a faucet on. it sounds like a fucking warzone in this bowl. i let out a big sigh of relief as at this point this is the best shit i have ever taken (which will be trumped by a future close call shit). then, i hear the door of the bathroom finally close (it's on a hinge that keeps the door from slamming by slowly closing). oh fuck, there's is zero chance they didn't hear that barrage of liquid and exploding shit coming from my brown eye. i clean myself up, wash my hands, and proceed to walk out of the door.

well, remember when i told you they never pay attention to who comes in and out? well apparently i was right about how loud it was and i walked out of the bathroom to all 4 women slyly peaking over the cubicle walls to witness who this destroyer of porcelain could be. i gave them a little smirk and quickly hustled back to my desk. there is no way that this "event" can/will be forgotten for a while. if i wasn't so embarrassed i'd be proud.

    Here is the article: this happened earlier today.    
for some context, my teacher is in her 50s and isn't attractive in any sense. i'm a straight-a student.    
one of my naive classmates starts calling her "mccougar" as he thinks it sounds cool. i try asking him if he even knows what that implies, but he continues saying it.    
a bit later, i'm walking with another friend and telling him how my classmate calls my teacher a cougar. i say "wtf he said mrs. x is a cougar" as we're walking down the stairs.    
as i say the last words, i nearly bump into my principal, also female. she has a quizzical look on her face.

she definitely heard me say cougar out loud, not sure about the rest. if she heard only the "mrs. x is a cougar" part.... well i'm fucked.

    Here is the summary: You are at risk of getting in trouble with your principal after your classmate called your teacher a "cougar" and you repeated the phrase out loud while walking down the stairs, potentially drawing your principal's attention to the situation

    Here is the article: so this happened about a month ago in the chemistry lab at school. we were studying electrochemical batteries, using acidified copper sulphate and zinc something or rather (i honestly can't remember). to those who didn't study chemistry, we used something called a salt bridge to link the two liquids so that the ions can flow through both of the liquids. my friend was in a particularly bad mood that day, and so when it came time to pack the experiment up, he said: "clean this fucking shit up thanks". i thought to my dumbass self: *i'll fucking show you* and picked put the salt bridge which was soaked in the chemicals and put it down his shirt. unfortunately, it got stuck in his lab at the top and stayed there. at first he didn't notice, so i giggled to myself and kept packing up. 10 minutes later, my friend complained that the back of his neck felt like it was on fire. i then realised that the salt bridge was stuck at the top of his lab coat and peeled it off. 
yep, peeled it.
the skin underneath was red and starting to swell, with small blisters forming. i took in a deep breath and thought, *well, i'm so fucked.*
our chemistry teacher saw me peel the salt bridge off his neck and ran over and asked what happened. i knew that there was no getting out of this one, so i told her. my friend was sent to the hospital after going to the school sick bay and treated for a chemical burn. meanwhile, i spent the rest of the day in-school suspended. we're still friends, but i can't say the same for me and the chemistry teacher, as i failed the unit on electrochemical batteries.

    Here is the article: i had been growing my hair out for 2 years but, i lost my job and thought a hair trim would make the job hunt easier. it all started off badly, should have been a sign not to do it in retrospect. before i could even power on my trimmer i dropped it and broke it's poor little head off. no problem i thought cause i had just the thing, kitchen shears. i just thought i'd start with the ol' hack and slash the the grizzly adams food catcher. they're bulkier than regular scissors so i thought just gliding them across at skin level would give me about a 1/4 inch of beard. as everyone knows this is as short as my beard ever dared to go, to keep from startling the babies, pets, and the ones with heart conditions. without hesitation i go full edward scissor hands and it was right to the skin. realizing there was no going back i unleashed the full facial nudity to the world. having lost a bit of nerve and all self confidence and respect for my own judgement, i asked my girlfriend to help with my hair. at this point she was shocked and most definitely horrified by the first glance of my baby bottom smooth face. yet, she was a good sport and proceeded to help. she put my hair in a pony tail type strangle hold and asked one last time if i was sure i wanted this. not to brag but i had some beautiful hair only seen on the most rare of unicorns but i could be biased. with only a few tears being fought back i say "do it." then snip, 6-7 inches of hair fall. it was the quietest murder ever.... until the laughter. i immediately ran to the nearest mirror to see what could inspire just a fit of cackling. i, random people of reddit, just gave birth to a one snip mullet. there's nothing wrong with a mullet, in theory. i'm just not a mullet rocking dude with a bitchin' trans am. though i would wish i was by nights end. i thought this must be fixable, i don't want to be compared to joe dirt. once again the evil hair killers were handed back to the girlfriend. snip snip snip-a-freaking-snip goes by and i'm left with what i can only describe as a lop sided bowl cut with odd bang type styling. this too i thought was repairable. i told her to just even it out and i'll deal with it later, somehow. as she was doing so i happened to make a joke about going full scorched earth on it and being done with it. the was no laughter but only the feeling of cold shears striking down to my poor pale scalp. at this point i freaked out a little cause i have never had short hair, much less a shaved head. i took over the scissors and locked my self away in what i thought was going to be my fortress of solitude. after trying desperately to find a way to fix it and failing, i started cutting. me and my body didn't not like this. i started shaking, sweating, and feeling sicker and sicker as my pale, pale scalp became more and more exposed. this was it, this was the moment where the hair couldn't be salvaged without looking like a dog with mange. this is where i got to use shaving cream for the first time in my life. i still have no idea of its purpose but, looking like i had a little bit of white fluffy hair was fun for a bit. after all was said and done and all the hair dispatched i walked out of the bathroom. my girlfriend looked at me like i had killed and ate our cat while kicking a baby. 10 minutes of silence later and she says that she feels like i'm a different person and it feels like she's cheating on me. i respond with the only thing that made sense, "what?" she goes on to tell me that she doesn't think she can be with me and also not me (it was confusing) and that it's just too strange. so, she's gone... hopefully to return? oh, and i had a job interview today for a job i was very qualified for and got a promising "i don't think it'll work out" as they tried very hard not to look directly into the ol' crystal ball.

"due to the lack of a state budge resulting from the budge impasse, the secretary of state's office has suspended the mailing of vehicle renewal reminder notices, which will save approximately $450,000 per month. by suspending this courtesy service, we prioritized the mailing of vehicle registration stickers themselves, along with titles, license plats and critical incorporation paperwork for illinois businesses. we encourage motorists to be aware of their license plate sticker's expiration date. motorists can sign up to receive reminder notices electronically by email."

    Here is the article: to set the scene: i work for a fairly small organization, about 25 or so employees. everyone knows everyone else quite well: we know about each other's lives, husbands and wives, kids, out-of-work hobbies and extracurriculars.

one of my coworkers, we'll call her margaret, brought in her newborn child one afternoon a few months ago. i've always been extremely irritated with the practice, although i know it's commonplace, for a few reasons:

1) not everyone likes babies.
2) not everyone likes to have their work day interrupted.
3) anyone who gets spotted by the proud new parent is required by unwritten law to genuflect and praise the infant.

i love babies. love 'em. i just don't like the interruption in my day, and i really can't stand the social awkwardness of the entire exchange.

i heard some ladies cooing over the baby down the hallway. i used some tactics i learned in the military (that is, "while playing metal gear solid") to triangulate the sound. it seemed stuck in the hallway that runs parallel to my office.

unfortunately, the call of nature was a bit louder than the adoration. now, i generally use the public men's room with the accessible stall instead of one of the private restrooms (look, i like to stretch out in the restroom, plus no one ever uses that one so i can relax in peace). the signal that told my brain "avoid the baby! avoid the baby!" completely disappeared, brought to you by the letter p and the number 1.

in my haste, thanks to the force of habit, i ran right into margaret and our coworker peggy.

"tuframnedox!" shouted peggy. "come look at the baby."

you mean i have to do this on a full bladder?

i walked over to beaming mama margaret and duckfaced peggy going absolutely baby-bonkers over the ugliest infant i have ever seen in my life. she looked like a newborn, female [wallace shawn](http://goo.gl/tcgpcs), however "inconthievable" that might sound. i recoiled slightly, said something like "oh, how lovely," and began to lean back and extricate myself from the situation.

"tuframnedox," said peggy. "isn't she just the cutest baby you've ever seen?"

**f-up 1:** instead of saying yes, agreeing, or not saying anything at all, i told the truth. in so doing, i said the single dumbest thing that has ever come out of my mouth.

"i don't know. i haven't seen *all the babies* yet."

peggy and margaret look at me, confused.

**f-up 2:** i said the single dumbest thing that has ever come out of my mouth. again.

"i just don't have enough evidence. *i haven't seen all the babies yet.*"

margaret is about to cry, and that's because of f-up 3 (or f-up 0, if you want to be perfectly accurate).

**f-up 3:** i forgot the reason that margaret was so proud of her little miracle: her last child died in the middle of delivery.

...

i am now officially the world's biggest jerk. thank god for peggy, who diffused the situation thusly:

"come on, tuframnedox! don't you know that every baby you see is the cutest baby you've ever seen?"

"yeah," i managed ... "uh, i really have to get to the men's room. thanks for bringing in the baby, margaret!"

every time i use the bathroom, i have residual guilt.

    Here is the article: ** 

so i was playing around with this thing called sendgrid. it allows you to send e-mails through a relay server. the important thing to note here is with these kind of servers, you can send an e-mail using any address in the "from" field. in short, it allows e-mail spoofing.

i had been watching tpb and wikileaks documentaries. i got carried away yesterday and sent a mass mail to my whole batch at midnight declaring that all the lectures of the next day have been cancelled. i used the registrar's e-mail address as the sender. that must be one of the stupidest mistakes of my life. the actual registrar then sent a mail saying that his account had been "hacked" and no classes have been cancelled.


our university has the bloody cyberoam. cyberoam keeps a track of what kind of activity each user is doing. i got caught and had to meet the registrar today. with the all the logs in front of me, i can't even deny my actions. i had to give in a written apology.


i'll probably be called before the disciplinary action committee. it's a bunch of soul-less professors. i think i might get removed from the university hostel for a semester. that's bad because living anywhere else is very costly.

edit: i do understand that i have been an idiot, and very childish, wasn't really trying to hurt anybody..it was just a very thoughtless attempt at temporary amusement

    Here is the summary: The student used Sendgrid to send a mass email to their entire batch, declaring that all lectures for the next day were cancelled, using the registrar's email address as the sender, leading to a "hacked" account accusation and a meeting with the disciplinary action committee, who may remove the student from the university hostel for a semester due to the costly living expenses outside of the hostel

    Here is the article: first, a little bit about me: i'm about to enter my senior year of high school, and my district has this thing where we have to earn a certain amount of community service hours in order to graduate. i've decided to spend some time this summer amassing a good amount said hours so that i can spend my school year focusing on other things.

a few days ago, i saw that my city was hosting a "summer hawaiian dance", and needed a few volunteers to help set-up/cleanup from 4:00pm-9:00pm. my first thought was that the dance was probably for the local middle school or something, and that they needed a few high schoolers to help out and supervise. hell, maybe they'd even let us boogie a bit if everything was going well. whatever the case, 5 whole hours of community service sounded rather fine to me. i also noticed that a girl whom i have a crush on signed-up too, so i was completely down.

anyways, i get there at 4:00pm, and this nice lady smiles at me and asks me if it's my first time working with their organization. i say yes, and she responds by saying something along the lines of, "oh, it's so nice that so many teenagers these days are willing to help out with kids who have down syndrome!". 

okay, so not exactly what i was originally expecting, but whatever, it's still cool. there are a total of 5 volunteers including myself; 2 boys and 3 girls. we help set-up the tables, put up the hawaiian themed decorations, prepare the snack table, etc. once the kids start arriving (ranging anywhere from 12-20 years old iirc), the lady tells us that we would mostly be helping them get snacks and drinks at the table. she starts telling us this funny story of how once, one kid just opened and chugged down an entire two-litter bottle of soda instead of pouring it into a cup. then it turned out to not be so funny as the young man had recently passed away.

the lady explains how although most of the songs would be pretty standard pop and rock, there would also be a few slow dance songs so that the boys could ask the girls to slow dance with them. since there were more girls attending than boys, she asked if the guy volunteers (i.e. my friend and i) could ask one of the girls to dance with us whenever a slow dance came on. again, no problem, it's cool. but this is around where my fu happened.

a slow dance comes on, my friend and i head over to the dance floor, and i ask one of the girls if i could have the pleasure of dancing with her. now, i'm trying my best to come off as a nice, charming young man, so i decide to engage in some small talk while dancing. i ask questions like, "how has your summer been?", or, "are you enjoying the dance tonight?". while giving her a twirl, i notice a ring pop candy ring on her finger. i didn't want to be mean or anything, but come on, i had to find out! so i say something along the lines of, "wow, that's a very beautiful ring on your finger!". upon hearing this she twists her face into a scowl and says, "yeah, well i'm married! so don't get any ideas!".

needless to say, i got rekt. destroyed. my confidence level fell from a 10 to a -2. yup, the brown stuff really hit the fan. suddenly a broken man, i hold back my tears, keep a smile plastered onto my face, and finish the rest of the dance in awkward silence before moping back to the snack table. while probably not my best decision, i decide with my friend and the girls what just went down. initial shock ("what op!? seriously!?") quickly turned into hysterical laughter. then, the making fun of me began. high school girls can be so mean :c. i wish i could say that that was the last of my embarrassment for the night, but sadly, yet another fu awaited for me on the dance floor.

a few songs later, another slow dance song comes up. mustering up my courage, i follow my friend back unto the dance floor and ask a girl to dance with me. she was a very nice girl, and aside from a  slight slur, she actually spoke very well. once again, i decided to engage in some small talk. after a small bit of explaining how there are volcanoes in hawaii, i decide to complement her by saying, "wow, you dance very well! sorry that i'm not nearly as good as you are! i'm pretty bad, haha!". she giggles a this, and responds by saying, "yeah, i can tell".

ouch. getting back up only to be pushed back down. once again, i finish the dance before sulking back to the snack table and regaling my friends with the events of my misfortune. sufficient to say, i earned yet another round of laughter. after the dance had ended and we had finished packing everything back up, i stood outside waiting for my ride along with the other volunteers. the lady from before comes up to us with our hour logs, and asks what we thought of the dance. i said that it was nice, but also decided to entertain her with a shortened account of my misadventures. after hearing this, she too laughed at me and said, "haha, yup! these dances sure are a great way to boost your confidence!".

    Here is the summary: You signed up to volunteer at a Hawaiian dance event for kids with Down syndrome, hoping to earn community service hours and maybe even impress a crush you had spotted on the sign-up list

    Here is the article: this actually happened a couple of hours ago.

i live in a housing addition that has about 75 houses in it (i'm still counting). pretty much everyone knows each other, but we're new, so we don't fit into that demographic just yet.

my dad and step-mom recently got married, so we're a family now, i guess. the both of them drink, sometimes the consumption is managed, other times they get a little bit tipsy. tonight happened to be the latter.

the day started out like any other. summer vacation so everyone's around the house, except for my father, who has work every day. proceed to the evening.

every day, my dad has at least one beer when he gets home. sometimes he has more. other times, my step-mom gets a little drunk as well. okay, a lot of drunk.  tonight being one of those occasions. i'm usually okay with this, because they don't get too bad.

so, my dad is cooking dinner, and i'm outside throwing a football with some buddies of mine. we're just shooting the shit when we see this little puppy, probably 2-3 years old, just wandering on down the road. me, being the decent person i am, decides that i'm going to help this little puppy.

my life hasn't been the most stable for the last year, and i haven't made the best decisions. so, i decided to try and get some positive karma on my side. i leash the dog, and tell my parents that i am going to figure out where this dog belongs.

that's when my step-mom decided to show her drunk off. she starts getting loud and proud about how much she wants to keep this dog. we already have two dogs, plus this is obviously someone else's (it had a collar). so, thinking that i've explained the situation, i head out to look for the puppy's home...

...no luck. i take him back to my house, where all hell has apparently broken loose. i am greeted by my dad screaming at me about how i'm an asshole because i decided to try and help the dog, because i guess my step-mom was upset about how we couldn't keep it. they start screaming at each other, and i walk out of the room. this goes on for about half and hour, and then it subsides. eventually we just let the dog go to find its home, and now i'm here writing this.

sorry if i'm not the best writer right now, i'm just a little drained.

    Here is the article: my wife and i have been in a loving relationship for almost a decade. we have no children and we can get a little bored with each other sometimes. we're only human!

so what do i do on friday afternoon before she comes home? i make up a fun, romantic game that we can play together in the comfort of our own apartment!

i fan out a deck of playing cards face down on the coffee table and think of quirky things to do if a particular card is drawn. i whip up a quick word doc and whamo: intructions to our very own "bored" game!

as some examples: if a 3 is drawn, kiss your spouse; if a jack is drawn, tell your spouse something they don't know about you; if an ace is drawn, chose a song and dance with your spouse throughout the whole thing. you get the picture. 

one of my favorites was drawing an 8. an 8 means you have to act out a movie scene with your spouse. i love me some movies so i have a handful of scenes that i can use for things like this. my wife, on the other hand, does not. in fact, the game was going quite smoothly until the 8's started rolling in. i drew the first three and made her act out some scenes even though she begged me not to.

"nope. these are the rules. you have to act them out with me," i insisted. much to her chagrin, she obliged and let me be jack torrance to her wendy, happy gilmore to her grandma, and woody to her buzz. every one was delightfully awkward and took her out of her comfort zone. it was what made it fun to me!

then she draws the last 8 and cracks a huge smile. i'm thinking, "atta girl! that's the spirit!" little did i know that there was something much more sinister going on.

my wife leaves the living room to get some props. she comes back with lipstick, a thin asian sarong, and our laptop playing "goodbye horses" by q-lazzarus. she laughs and says, "get dressed and start dancing, buffalo bill!"

immediately i'm thinkin, "nope. not doing it. even i have my limits!" she sees the look on my face and reminds me that the rules state that i have to act it out.

    Here is the article: my wife and i have been in a loving relationship for almost a decade. we have no children and we can get a little bored with each other sometimes. we're only human!

so what do i do on friday afternoon before she comes home? i make up a fun, romantic game that we can play together in the comfort of our own apartment!

i fan out a deck of playing cards face down on the coffee table and think of quirky things to do if a particular card is drawn. i whip up a quick word doc and whamo: intructions to our very own "bored" game!

as some examples: if a 3 is drawn, kiss your spouse; if a jack is drawn, tell your spouse something they don't know about you; if an ace is drawn, chose a song and dance with your spouse throughout the whole thing. you get the picture. 

one of my favorites was drawing an 8. an 8 means you have to act out a movie scene with your spouse. i love me some movies so i have a handful of scenes that i can use for things like this. my wife, on the other hand, does not. in fact, the game was going quite smoothly until the 8's started rolling in. i drew the first three and made her act out some scenes even though she begged me not to.

"nope. these are the rules. you have to act them out with me," i insisted. much to her chagrin, she obliged and let me be jack torrance to her wendy, happy gilmore to her grandma, and woody to her buzz. every one was delightfully awkward and took her out of her comfort zone. it was what made it fun to me!

then she draws the last 8 and cracks a huge smile. i'm thinking, "atta girl! that's the spirit!" little did i know that there was something much more sinister going on.

my wife leaves the living room to get some props. she comes back with lipstick, a thin asian sarong, and our laptop playing "goodbye horses" by q-lazzarus. she laughs and says, "get dressed and start dancing, buffalo bill!"

immediately i'm thinkin, "nope. not doing it. even i have my limits!" she sees the look on my face and reminds me that the rules state that i have to act it out.

checkmate. i don the sarong and make her swear not to judge me. i get into character and act the scence out. the whole fucking scene. lipstick. dancing. asking myself if i'd fuck me. the nipple pull. the tuck. all of it.

while we had a great time and i wouldn't have traded that night for all the world, there was something about tucking in my tally wacker while wearing lipstick that just didn't feel right.

    Here is the article: i'm generally useless when it comes to going for routine checkups. i've not been to the dentist for around 6 years and not had a eye test for 3. 

seeing as the company (uk) i work for have a good medical plan and we're also all getting made redundant i figured i'd try and max out all of my company benefits.

i've been to the dentist. incredibly i'm in good shape. had to have a filling topped up (i didn't know i had a filling).

next stop was the optician.

i have to wade through town to get from the office over to specsavers. in doing so i go past every single high street shop, chav, big issue, old woman and shoe shiner.

our town normally gets flooded on a daily basis with charity workers. today was no different.

i'm a target for these people, i don't know what it is about me or why i attract them but if they're not with somebody they actually jump over an entire pavement full of potential pundits to get to me. making eye contact from at least a mile away.

today's lady caught me and asked if i had a moment to chat, and me without my phone had to actually talk to her. however i remembered i had the perfect excuse! 

i simply said 'sorry i can't stop i am off to get my eyes tested'. i was so pleased that for once i didn't have to lie to a charity worker!! i did notice however that her big grin immediately changed to one of distaste.

figured she must be on commission.

i skipped off, got to specsavers on time and got my eyes fixed.

on the way back i managed to bee-line it so i didn't get caught out again by the fleet of charity workers. 

i did notice however something i missed earlier - they were all working for blind children uk (http://www.blindchildrenuk.org/)

i felt so ashamed that i immediately went to their website when i got back to the office and gave them £20.

    Here is the summary: You went to the dentist and found out that you had a filling that needed to be topped up, but you also had a good experience with the charity workers for Blind Children UK while on your way to the optician

    Here is the article: i had just spent a week on a really awful piece of work, and decided to reward myself with one of my favourite meals: spinach and chickpea curry with mushroom rice. 
it was totally delicious. i was so excited to sit on the sofa, watch a movie, and enjoy my home cooked deliciousness.
when i have spicy food, i like a little extra salt on. not much, just a small amount. especially on rice. 
i went to sprinkle a little salt on from the salt shaker, getting ever more excited to fill my belly with tasty, tasty food. 
but lo and behold, it was not to be.
as i was sprinkling salt on my food, the lid of the salt shaker came off, and the entirety of the salt shaker was deposited on my curry. ruining it. 
to make it worse, i had just used the last of my rice, and mushrooms, so i couldn't even make anymore without going out into the cold, wintery night to get more :(
literally ruined my day.

    Here is the article: i have a feeling i may be on some kind of list now. this just happened...

in my family were have an inside joke, at least i think it's an inside joke, that if someone has gone to the loo and they are taking a long time, you say they are "dominating" in there. so let's say i need the loo but my brother is occupying it, i'd shout "hurry up, are you dominating or something?". 

anyway knowing that, i was on a call to a friend of mine about 15 minutes ago. i said i would call back after i go get another beer, he said okay, just make sure i have enough time to have a slash. fair enough, so 15 minutes later i call and there is no reply, it rings to answer phone. so i text him "dominating?".

all good, but as i've been playing call of duty all day, i am in computer game mode and remembered playing unreal tournament years back, where when you are kicking arse it would say "dominating!" in a booming voice. so with this in mind i thought i'd find a suitable pic from my windows phone. so i pressed the search button and typed "toilet dominating"...

nope nope nope...

btw i'm in the pub using their wifi :(

note : windows phone, as you know has bing integrated, which automatically shows image results at the top of the search too, and yes i do have "safe search" off, but not for that!!!

    Here is the article: (technically this happened a couple weeks ago, but the consequences revealed themselves last thursday).

for starters, i'm a recently engaged young egyptian man (though i've lived my whole life in the states). i ended up purchasing the engagement ring a few months back from a local jeweler because they were super friendly and helpful. the owner is a middle eastern man and decided to thank some of his recent customers by sending us a box of baklava.

unfortunately, they sent it to my home address, not my current college address. when it arrived, the box read prominently, "middle eastern pastries" [proof](http://i.imgur.com/03fu08d.jpg).

anyway, my sister sent me a photo of the box and asked what it was for. i'm a pretty funny guy (definitely not biased), and i like to take any opportunity to crack a joke. so naturally, i quipped, "oh! that's a thank you gift for helping the terrorists with their bomb!"

well. in hindsight, that was a terrible reply, seeing as we're egyptian.

i discovered this today when i was paid a visit from a pair of intimidating-looking fbi agents. and i live in an apartment, so that naturally attracted a crap-ton of attention from my friends and neighbors.

they sat me down in my apartment and questioned me for what seemed like several hours (it was only about an hour). i was sweating bullets the whole time, freaking out that i wasn't answering their questions right.

thank god they eventually left, after no shortage of reprimanding. but now virtually no-one will talk to me who saw this go down, and i'm being given really derisive looks by everyone i pass in the apartment complex. and on top of all that, i'm pretty sure they mentioned something about being placed on a watchlist. so my life kind of sucks right now.

    Here is the summary: A recently engaged Egyptian man living in the US made a joke about "helping terrorists with their bomb" when he received a box of Middle Eastern pastries from a local jeweler, which was misinterpreted and led to a visit from the FBI

    Here is the article: well, actually this happened a couple months ago, but whatever. i had a major crush on this girl from my class since i was a high school fresman (we were seniors), but i never got the nerve to ask her out, until the last two months of the school year. i said "well, screw it" and asked her to go out with me and have some ice cream. she said yes (to my surprise, i was waiting to be rejected since she is way out of my league.)
   
so we went out and it was great. i wasn't planning on making a move, since we barely knew each other, so it was just about spending quality time together.

   anyway, i asked her out again a week after, this time to go to the movies, and this is where the real story begins: it was all fun and games until she got scared by a scene and grabbed my hand. then, being the good guy that i am, i put my arm around her. i said to myself "this is it!" and tried to lift the armrest up, to make things easier for us. but that damn thing was stuck! i tried harder, but it was worthless. the whole time the girl was staring at me, and i could see the pity in her eyes. after a moment she said "forget it, i'm alright." and leaned to the other side, getting away from me. after that, nothing happened between us, and i spent the whole night silently cursing the poor motherf***er who broke the damn thing.

    Here is the summary: The narrator had a crush on a girl from his high school class and finally worked up the courage to ask her out, but their first movie date was ruined when the armrest in the theater was stuck and the girl pitied him for his failed attempt to lift it

    Here is the article: i walked into my classroom this morning and everyone seemed oddly depressed and silent. wanting to liven up the mood and start conversation, i decided to say something. eventually i decided to say aloud, "well, who died?" in a joking manner of course. little did i know that someone that went to our school had overdosed on pills and actually died over spring break. my entire class proceeded to glare at me for the rest of the hour.

    Here is the summary: I walked into my classroom and noticed everyone was depressed and silent, so I tried to lighten the mood by jokingly asking "Who died?" not realizing that someone from our school had actually died from an overdose over spring break, which led to my classmates glaring at me for the rest of the hour

    Here is the article: i am a relatively inexperienced driver. i bought my first car a month ago, after a life of urban public transit and, till recently, being driven around by my former partner.

today i planned to go on a nice hike for new year's day. i had been looking forward to it for a month. my plan was to go out on new year's eve with friends and return home at 10pm to ensure i had a restful evening before getting out to the trailhead.

as my two friends were drinking and vaping, it stopped seeming fun to hang around with them at 9:30 pm... since i'm hoping to become the kind of person who thinks getting up at 6 to go hiking on a holiday is reasonable. 

still, i decided to stay and watch youtube sober with them till fireworks time. as 11pm neared, i offered to drive them home since they would have taken two buses after midnight and i had a longer drive ahead of me anyway. fireworks enjoyed, friends safely deposited at their home, dutifully dd'd my way home avoiding (and judging) the usual degree of obvious drunk driving for most of the way.

neglected to check my ride-share offer for the hike the next morning. one person i had offered a ride to, i didn't get back to early enough, and the long gap before my reply ended up causing her to cancel her plans. another rider and i confirmed we were on for 7:45am. did not return home till almost 1:30 or fall asleep till after 2am.

woke up at 6:45 bleary, definitely underslept, and powered by adrenaline to do this thing. not a good start for 2018.

i picked up the remaining ride share passenger, and took a too-soon turn because i couldn't quite follow her directions, but eventually got on the freeway. the passenger was asking me some small talk question that put me in mind of my former partner whom i left (and, related, lost my home) on thanksgiving. i was merging into the main traffic lane as the small talk conversation  took place. i didn't check carefully and damn near changed lanes into another car. 

huge horn-honk, death stare. it was entirely to the other driver's credit that he avoided me. i watched him drive away probably terrified that a normal freeway drive at 8am on a nice day had nearly killed him.

i completed the drive to the trailhead, hiked for ten minutes, felt sick, let the woman know she would need to find another ride back, rested in my car for 45 minutes, drove to my temporary residence and fell into bed. i've been napping and watching youtube and reading reddit all day, feeling too guilty to get proper sleep and too wrecked to get up.

i hope that adequate resolutions would be "for the sake of basic decency, just don't drive tired" and "do what's right for yourself before trying to help others." the latter would be a clue to why my late 2017 was such a garbage fire.

    Here is the summary: As a relatively inexperienced driver, you went on a hike on New Year's Day despite being tired and almost causing an accident on the freeway due to small talk with a passenger that reminded you of your former partner

    Here is the article: i'm someone who's kind of obnoxious about my love of spicy food. actually, it's kind of insufferable for anyone who spends a meal with me. so, after my constant bragging, my girlfriend's dad challenges me. he brings home some ghost peppers, which are 900 times hotter than tobasco sauce on the scoville scale. my pride is on the line, so of course i go for it. 

i immediately regretted my decision. that fucker was *hot*. sharp pain erupted across the sides of my tongue, and my throat burned as i swallowed it. the torture didn't end there though, as it continued to burn once it got to my stomach. 

i needed relief. any relief. my 'calm and collected spice guy' cover was already blown, so i flailed around frantically in their fridge looking for milk. i grabbed the first jug i saw, and downed about half of it. i thought it tasted kind of weird, but hell that was probably on account of my mouth being shat on by lucifer himself. 

after ten minutes of torture, the pain finally started to subside. only then was it that her dad decided to bring a very salient fact to my attention. 
"hey, was that the whole milk, or did you grab the skim?" 
"skim."
"oh... that's..." he walked over to the half-depleted jug to verify his initial thought. "yeah, that's about two and a half weeks expired". 

cue the worst gastrointestinal distress of my life. i am writing this sitting on the toilet, the fiery shits are coming so frequently that there's really no point for me to even leave. oh, and did i mention that i have a flight in like four hours? 

update: got done with my flight. i had a window seat, so the people sitting next to me were annoyed by the fourth time i ran to the bathroom in a two hour flight. also, the toilets on planes are disconcertingly shallow because of the splash factor. overall, 0/10 would not recommend.

    Here is the summary: I, a self-proclaimed spice enthusiast, was challenged by my girlfriend's dad to try some ghost peppers, which ended up being a terrible idea as they were excruciatingly hot and caused me to consume expired milk, leading to a gastrointestinal disaster that ruined my flight experience

    Here is the article: ok so last night i was paraletic. which is basically another term for star-spangled, schnokered, rekt, gregged or gazeboed. basically i was what you would say a state of pure alcohol-induced fairy land. i remember not getting in a cab, i remember not getting out of the cab, but i am beginning to remember that which happened in the cab. 

now i'm a man of pride (so i like to think) and i will pay a man for his service without question. as this hangover-ridden day slowly unturns more stones in my head of the happenings of last night, i am realising what a complete tool i was last night. i had spent all my money on the poison that we all buy without question and turns us into a sloppy mess, and found myself in this taxi with all of £3. once i realised this, i informed the taxi driver of my lack of resources to pay him, and he immediately pulled over and demanded i pay him the full amount for the cab journey (even though i remember being dropped off not 3 minutes from the city which would be where i would've gotten in) and locked the doors to stop me from leaving. i gave him the money in my pocket which more than covered the distance he'd actually taken me, but alas he still demanded the £10 or so for the entire journey. he, realising i was in no position to barter due to my alcoholic spangled mind, then told me to give him something which would cover the cost. like wtf man this isn't the stone ages, i don't carry things for trade. to make a long story short, i gave him my phone with the promise from him that he would return it the next day in exchange for the cab fare. my drunken logic was that i could ring my phone from another and therefore arrange to meet the guy. on waking up i realised what a massive idiot i am and barring my ongoing faith in humanity being proven deserved, i am never going to see that phone again. it's probably not even worth as much as the cab fare, the phone is shit. so that's my fuck up.

now i'm a man of pride (so i like to think) and i will pay a man for his service without question. as this hangover-ridden day slowly unturns more stones in my head of the happenings of last night, i am realising what a complete tool i was last night. i had spent all my money on the poison that we all buy without question and turns us into a sloppy mess, and found myself in this taxi with all of £3. once i realised this, i informed the taxi driver of my lack of resources to pay him, and he immediately pulled over and demanded i pay him the full amount for the cab journey (even though i remember being dropped off not 3 minutes from the city which would be where i would've gotten in) and locked the doors to stop me from leaving. i gave him the money in my pocket which more than covered the distance he'd actually taken me, but alas he still demanded the £10 or so for the entire journey. he, realising i was in no position to barter due to my alcoholic spangled mind, then told me to give him something which would cover the cost. like wtf man this isn't the stone ages, i don't carry things for trade. to make a long story short, i gave him my phone with the promise from him that he would return it the next day in exchange for the cab fare. my drunken logic was that i could ring my phone from another and therefore arrange to meet the guy. on waking up i realised what a massive idiot i am and barring my ongoing faith in humanity being proven deserved, i am never going to see that phone again. it's probably not even worth as much as the cab fare, the phone is shit. so that's my fuck up.

    Here is the summary: The author got drunk and took a taxi home, but forgot to pay the driver and only had £3 left

    Here is the article: ok, so i live in a really really small place and there are not a lot of morbidly obese people here, this is important to the story. - like most, this didn't happen today, but a couple of months ago and when retelling it today, i thought i should share.

**** this is not meant to offend anyone and is merely my son and i having a tifu ****

my three year old son and i are sat on the bus, the way our buses work you have a few seats at the front, then a disabled/pram area with two pull down seats and then a narrow aisle with some steps to reach the other seats (the aisle area really is quite narrow).

>my son and i are sat on the first set of seats up the step, so we are overlooking the disabled/pram area.

at the next stop a very morbidly obese man (i'd say 500lbs+ honestly) gets on the bus, he gets to the aisle part with the steps, looks at it, then turns around and sits in the disabled section in a pull down seat, right in front of us - you should note here that these seats face sideways, so he is sitting half facing us....

my three year old pulls on my arm and i feel mummydread, as he then asks me in a fairly loud voice:

>mummy, that man didn't come and sit at the back... is he too fat to get up the steps?

i try to hush him, a few people snickering behind me and the only way he will stop repeating "is he too fat" is when i say i don't know quite loudly... he then stops and thinks for a minute and then... to my horror!!

he lean forward and waves at the man then loudly shouts down to him

> are you too fat to get up the steps?!

.....the whole bus starts giggling, i turn bright red, hush my son and start pressign the stop bell whilst staring at my shoes which ar e suddenly all i wanna look at, the bus stopped a few seconds later and despite being nowhere near our stop, we got off the bus and waited for the next one...

    Here is the article: this just happened about an hour ago. i live in california, where it's been raining quite a lot the past few days on and off, so the ground is still really slippery where it hasn't dried off yet.  

so recently, i figured that if i run a few miles every night ( because i have some time after school ends and there's barely any homework ) i'd lose some weight. and so every run doesn't feel like a 60-minute drag, i listen to music while i run ( who doesn't right? )  

so i'm running today, and a song that i really like called rooftop comes on, by the dave matthews band. while running, i do a little mini dance, kind of doing the thing dave does in the music video. and then of course, like the idiot i am, i slip on the wet ground mid-dance and slam into a tree. i did a mini slide on the mud, and rolled right onto the street, where a car just zooms past me. i was two and a half feet away from being turned into asian meat stew. i came home pretty quick after that happened.

    Here is the article: obligatory “this didn’t happen today, but a couple of months ago.” i fucked up big time, and it all started with talking about steve buscemi. 

i was at my fiancee’s parents’ house celebrating my fiancee’s birthday. her dad and i were talking about “boardwalk empire’s” finale, since we’re both fans of the show. i was pretty nervous, since this guy doesn’t trust me at all and he’s 4 inches and 50 pounds bigger than i am. so there i am, uneasily trying to make small talk with my fiancee’s father. we get to talking about tv, and we both find out we’re both fans of boardwalk empire.

i’m thinking “jackpot!” i can at least try and sustain the conversation now, beyond the usual small talk about sports. he mentions to me that he’s a huge fan of steve buscemi, and that he’s meeting him. he goes on about how his friend knows steve buscemi and his friend is having a charity event that steve buscemi’s going to, and he talks about how he’s so excited and shit like that. then he invites me to come along with him, saying “it’ll be a good idea to try and bond before the wedding.” i’m pretty excited that i’ll be meeting steve buscemi, since it’s steve motherfuckin’ buscemi. we talk excitedly about “boardwalk empire” and the movie “fargo”.

so by this time a couple of weeks have passed, and it’s the day of the event. my fiancee’s father is picking me up and taking me there from my house. i’m feeling horny and my fiancée and i start fucking. well, did that turn out to be a mistake. we’re in the middle of it when we hear a rapping at the door. we ignore it, and then the door opens. well, my fiancee’s father comes in the middle of us going doggystyle. we cover up and apologize, and i get dressed. he’s staring at me disapprovingly when i get in the car, because i just gave him another reason to hate me. i offer to drive, since i’m trying to make up for everything that’s happened. he relents, and i take over the wheel.

i’m cruising down, with him shaking his head at me. then a car rearends us, and when i get out, i find my fiancee’s father’s rear bumper has been pulverized. we call a tow truck, and swap insurance with the other driver and stuff like that. finally the tow truck comes, and i pay for it. the tow truck driver actually takes us to the event, since the venue is right next to his shop. we thank him, and i tip him generously for his help. 

we walk into the fundraiser, but steve buscemi is nowhere to be found. my fiancee’s father asks his friend where steve buscemi is, and he replies that he left. we were waiting for the tow truck so long, that we missed our chance to meet him. now my fiancee’s father is really angry, and he starts yelling at me in the middle of this place.

he yells “you dumb fuck, you fucked it all up! i knew [daughter’s name] should’ve stayed with brad!”

“who’s brad?” i ask. 

“ahh, she didn’t tell you?” he says.

“nope, now tell me, who is brad?” i ask.

“well, that was her ex-fiancé until she broke off the engagement.” he tells me. this is all news to me, and i’m mad that she never told me about this even though we’re engaged to be married. i go outside to get some air, and i start texting her, asking who is brad. i pace around the plaza, texting a long message on my phone asking about brad, and telling her that she can always tell me anything. well, how does it get worse? while texting this long, heartfelt message, i walk straight into this fountain. it was one of those fountains that have no barrier, and the water all goes down a drain. i wasn’t looking where i was going, and i got my shoes and pants leg wet as well as dropping my phone in shock. i pick up my phone, and fortunately it still works.  at this point, i don’t give a fuck, and i call a cab. i call my fiancée and i tell her that i want to call off the engagement temporarily, since i find it’s a problem that we’re engaged and she doesn’t trust me. eventually, after trying some counseling, we call it off since we’re not nearly as compatible as we thought we were, and she moves out.

    Here is the article: tifu. not today. years ago in fact, but the fuck up is still just as fucked as any up could ever be fucked. 

it was about one week into my tour in afghanistan and i was still getting used to my new diet of curry chicken and juice boxes. a war on intestinal terror that ol red, white and blue wasn't winning. you had two options if you wanted to go colon bowling; your standard portapoty, or a conex box. despite the the crude idea you may have about sliding one out in a conex box, in a combat zone, this is prime real estate for shitting. unlike your standard g.i portapoty, (read: slightly more disgusting than the average portapoty) the conex box has 3 separate stalls inside, two sinks with mirrors, and an air filtration system that exchanges the smell of swamp ass for the taste of desert sand. 

10:30 pm friday night and i just finished my post work meal. "pita bread curry chicken cheese-whiz sandwich" (patent pending) and washed it down with a small carton of milk. the moment all the flavors and textures rendezvoused inside my stomach and registered back to my brain, i heard the first rumble of a shit storm. i tried to hold out until i got back to my housing unit about 1.5 miles away but halfway there decided to search out a conex box. every step i took in the quiet afghan night the more confident i became that the cauldron of hell building up in my stomach needed to be released. after five minutes of no luck, desperation began to fill my mind but luckily i located a beautiful conex bathroom off in the distance. i immediately rushed inside. 

upon entering i see the crap castle is empty, just the way i like it. i, of course, go to the last stall and quickly get settled, drop trou and brace for impact. as soon as i'm ready to release the kraken i hear the door open and someone walk in. now i don't need to explain this, but nothing ruins dropping the first load in a public restroom like someone walking in and turning on the sink. in an attempt to pause the action as best i can and not make a sound, i seize up and hold my breath. the brown banana is still slowly growing out of my hole. i notice the guy isn't going into a stall, just standing at the sink. doing what? probably hiding from guard watch. what a lazy ass. the turtle head keeps slowly sliding out until it finally brakes of and splashes in the water. i hear the noise by the sink pause. the cats out the bag now, my cover is blown. i take a deep breath and fire the ass cannon as hard as i can. my eyes are shut, and i'm using my m16 for balance as i pretty much assault the toilet bowl with wave after wave of weaponized ass blast. when the deed is done, half conscious but bowels empty i notice this clown at the sink is still standing there. wtf? i debate waiting it out but decided i'm not patient enough and if anything this guy is nothing less than impressed. 

i handle the finishing rituals inside the stall, open the stall door and turn the corner to see what is thee hottest red head, mid application of her make up. we both lock eyes in a simultaneous expression that says *one of us has fucked up*. after what feels like eternity of embarrassment she spoke, "this is the women's restroom." now, understand i've had a decent amount of military training by this point in my service; a lot of which geared towards deescalating situations and knowing the right things to say at the right time. using all of that knowledge i was able to muster my perfectly crafted response. "no it isn't." she just stands there, never taking her eyes off me and mentally processing the anal exorcism she just heard. i dropped my head low and just ran out of there like a small child. as i exit i run right into the group of people waiting for her. fuck my entire life, they all knew exactly what happened. especially as i walked away and hear one of the guys in the group joking yell "wait, did you wash your hands?"

    Here is the summary: The author recounts a humiliating experience from their time in Afghanistan when they accidentally used the women's restroom while in a state of explosive diarrhea and were caught by a group of women, including a red-headed woman who was mid-makeup application

upon entering i see the crap castle is empty, just the way i like it. i, of course, go to the last stall and quickly get settled, drop trou and brace for impact. as soon as i'm ready to release the kraken i hear the door open and someone walk in. now i don't need to explain this, but nothing ruins dropping the first load in a public restroom like someone walking in and turning on the sink. in an attempt to pause the action as best i can and not make a sound, i seize up and hold my breath. the brown banana is still slowly growing out of my hole. i notice the guy isn't going into a stall, just standing at the sink. doing what? probably hiding from guard watch. what a lazy ass. the turtle head keeps slowly sliding out until it finally brakes of and splashes in the water. i hear the noise by the sink pause. the cats out the bag now, my cover is blown. i take a deep breath and fire the ass cannon as hard as i can. my eyes are shut, and i'm using my m16 for balance as i pretty much assault the toilet bowl with wave after wave of weaponized ass blast. when the deed is done, half conscious but bowels empty i notice this clown at the sink is still standing there. wtf? i debate waiting it out but decided i'm not patient enough and if anything this guy is nothing less than impressed. 

i handle the finishing rituals inside the stall, open the stall door and turn the corner to see what is thee hottest red head, mid application of her make up. we both lock eyes in a simultaneous expression that says *one of us has fucked up*. after what feels like eternity of embarrassment she spoke, "this is the women's restroom." now, understand i've had a decent amount of military training by this point in my service; a lot of which geared towards deescalating situations and knowing the right things to say at the right time. using all of that knowledge i was able to muster my perfectly crafted response. "no it isn't." she just stands there, never taking her eyes off me and mentally processing the anal exorcism she just heard. i dropped my head low and just ran out of there like a small child. as i exit i run right into the group of people waiting for her. fuck my entire life, they all knew exactly what happened. especially as i walked away and hear one of the guys in the group joking yell "wait, did you wash your hands?"

    Here is the summary: The author tells a humorous story about a time when they accidentally used the women's restroom in a combat zone in Afghanistan during their military service, and the embarrassing situation that ensued when they were caught by a group of female soldiers
    


    You will be given one summary written for a news article. Your task is to rate the summary based on the following criteria:
    Output format: PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE

    Evaluation Criteria:
    1. Read the news article carefully and identify the main topic and key points.
    2. Read the summary and compare it to the news article. Check if the summary covers the main topic and key points of the news article, and if it resents them in a clear and logical order.
    3. Rate the summary with 5 percentages, where each one represents how likely the summary is going to get a score from 1 to 5. For example, if you think the summary is 80% likely to get a score of 5, 10% likely to get a score of 4, 5% likely to get a score of 3, 3% likely to get a score of 2, and 1% likely to get a score of 1, you should rate the summary as 80, 10, 5, 3, 2.

    Here is the article: this happened several hours ago. i work on checkouts at weekends in a slightly smaller branch of one of the major uk supermarkets (not naming names here but i'm sure most of you can guess which one). so i was on a till, serving customers, usual thing for about an hour-ish. then i get to the end of a woman's transaction and she wants to pay by gift card which someone gave to her as a present - i say "ok that's fine" and try to swipe the gift card. it didn't swipe. tried multiple times. nope. till just said *beep* -unable to read card-

usually at this point there is a long number on the card which can be typed in and then, by pressing the 'enter' button on the till, the transaction can be processed - however if i remember correctly this needs to be approved by a supervisor first (they physically have to go up to the till and put a key in for it to work etc). so i called my supervisor, and while waiting for her to come over and help, my brain told me to press the enter button before putting in the card number. big mistake. my cash drawer opened and a receipt printed itself out signalling the end of that transaction - i.e. the till had thought the shop had been paid for when actually it hadn't. 

now i was panicking because my supervisor was taking ages to come to my till, and by this point there was a huge queue of customers at my checkout who were taking their shopping off my belt in a pissed off manner and going to the other tills. surprisingly though, my current customer was not angry at me and was just a little bit confused by what was going on. when my supervisor finally did arrive, she was in a rush so rushed the customer off to customer services at the other end of the store with the shopping and gift card. 

i felt relieved but also super guilty at all the trouble i had just caused that poor woman, and carried on serving customers. after a while my colleague came over from the customer service desk, handed me some money and told me that the woman whose transaction i'd buggered up earlier had been forced to pay for her shopping in cash. i then had to put the cash in the till and write a note to the cash office people explaining what had just happened (i also said i was sorry and drew a sad face). i don't think i will get  into any trouble for this really (well i bloody hope not!) as everyone makes mistakes, but this was really embarrassing considering i've been working here for almost 2 years.

    Here is the summary: The author worked on checkouts at a major UK supermarket on a weekend and had a technical issue with a gift card payment, causing the till to malfunction and print a receipt for a transaction that had not been fully paid

    Here is the article: so this happened last hour. i'm a freshman in high school and i'm freaking out. 

i was in my 4th hour (photoshop). i had a good hour, finished my assignments, and decided to fuck around the rest of the hour.

so this one kid, we'll call him jeff, decides to sit in a chair, and put his legs through the other chair, the back of it. i thought this was hilarious, kids were pushing him around, it was a good time.

now comes the fuck up, i decide it would be hilarious to tip him over, since he has no use of his legs, he'll just wiggle in and out of the chair. 

that's not what happens. i tip the chair, causing one half of his body to fall, then i tip the other, and hear him scream in pain. his legs were twisted with the chair as it fell and they were apparently hurt. he had some kids help him, and i'm just sitting there thinking what the fuck am i gonna do, i don't want to get suspended. 

he tells the teacher, who sends him to the nurse with the help of some friends, and she writes me a referral. 

i fucked up and hurt a kid, yes, but that's nothing compared to what my girlfriend will do to me if i miss our formal dance due to being suspended.

there's this guy i share some classes with, who is depressed and suicidal or something like that. he's also absent from lessons a lot, because of some health problems.
on this particular day, he was back at school, after having been staying at home for about two weeks. 


so this guy, let's call him luke, walks into the room and i'm glad he's back because we were getting along quite well before this incident. 
i call out "hey, what a surprise you're still alive!" (in a joking way, like i often do when i haven't seen someone for a while)

his face changes from smiling to an incredibly upset and hurt frown in less than a millisecond, the moment i realize what i just said.


well, it gets even worse.. later a friend of his tells me, luke tried to commit suicide and nearly succeeded about two weeks ago, being the reason for his absence from school. 


needless to say, i've never been able to talk to him again since that.

    Here is the article: okay, so here's the obligatory "this happened a year ago" statement.   

i was working retail at the time and i was stressed out after a long shift at a popular store at an even more popular mall. my car had broken down and i was broke, but i wanted to get kinda lit to forget my troubles. so i remembered that one episode of how i met your mother where marshall has to get a background check and is afraid of his employer finding the video of him drinking 40s naked.   

this is where my night was going well. i put on my favorite pair of basketball shorts, so i could easily pee, and had my girlfriend help me tape the 40s to my hands. i went with mickey's, a beer i never had before and went to town. before i knew it, the beer was gone and i was pretty drunk. believe it or not, i only had to pee twice while all taped up, which i found surprising because i drank 80 oz of beer in a little over an hour.  

well now it's time for bed and i have an 8 am shift at the store so i quick brush my teeth, throw on netflix, and pass out. i must have had a dream where i walked myself to the bathroom and started peeing because i can't think of any other reason why the following could have happened.   

apparently i sleep-walked to my girlfriend's side of the bed and started peeing in her night stand. like i opened the drawer and started peeing. she is clearly the responsible one in this relationship, and she is in charge of keeping the passports, and other important documents together. well she stored them, yes past tense for obvious reasons, in her nightstand. she was able to snap me out of it before i got it all out, thankfully. (50% in she started screaming at me "wtf are you doing??! omg!!!")     

so now at 3 am i am wide awake, and horribly embarrassed cleaning my pee off of our travel documents, lease agreement, and social security cards and i have to be at work at 8 am.     

moral of the story is don't drink so much that you sleep pee in your girlfriend's nightstand.

    Here is the article: tifu. it's never actually is today is it? no. it takes awhile to gather exactly where the fuck up begins and ends. i could easily begin at birth but for the sake of your time i'll begin with when i first started mma.
.



i don't need to tell you that mma is a violent sport and injury is expected. it happens. at this particular time it was the end of our training and we played a game called circle of death. it's not as fun as it sounds. basically you make a circle with one person standing in the middle, legs spread and hands behind their head. going clockwise, one by one someone on the outside of the circle steps up an performs one strike and steps out. the strike can be a punch, kick or knee but no elbows because that's just a dick move. the concept is to make the person in the middles life as shitty as possible; something you later regret once you're in the middle. first off, understand that fighting, in its core is very basic. a lot of it is reacting to your opponent but without that variable you can exhaust your flashy move set pretty quickly. 
.



at this time it was code name katie's turn to be in the middle. everyone is having a good old time just, ya know, beating the shit out of katie. i'm pacing myself, saving all my *good moves* for someone more well suited. as the rotation goes i'm thinking ahead of time what my next move is. it's in my head. *step up. switch kick to the outer leg. step out.* easy. the person to my right , code name kyle, steps up and guess what he does? yep, switch kick to the outer leg. now my whole game plan has to change on the fly. my default favorite strike is a rear knee. i just love it. so i step up, i clinch the back of katie's head and pull her head to my chest. as i do this i look back at kyle saying "dude that's what i was going to do!" me looking back caused my balance to slightly shift and instead of throwing my knee forward, i threw it upwards. directly, *i mean directly* into katie's unadulterated vagina. immediately she drops, clutching her south mouth in pain. i don't know wether i felt bad because of what i just did or because my knee got more action in one second than i did all year. needles to say, i was put in the middle. we were actually able to laugh about it later and katie and i are great friends to this day.

    Here is the article: [if you haven't read my actual tifu, read it here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/4k9ifq/tifu_by_probably_failing_my_chemistry_final/)

so, a week ago, in chemistry, my teacher announced that she had finished marking the chemistry finals, and was ready to give them back to us. she told us that she was a bit disappointed with the results, but won't give us too much flak for it, since she acknowledges that it was a difficult paper. *gulp*

when she called out my name, i remember my legs were shaking, and i know it sounds so dumb, but even though i hadn't seen the results, i was already starting to tear up because *i was really scared*. when she handed me the paper, bless her heart, she tried to make me feel better. *"don't be too hard on yourself,"* she said, *"you still got the highest mark in class."*

have you ever physically felt your heart sink? have you ever felt as if your stomach was knotting over itself?

that's how i felt when i saw the red **b-** on the front of the test paper.

i bolted from the classroom and locked myself in a toilet stall so i could scream without having to be surrounded by people i care about. i remember having to tell myself to breathe and to not think about the cane, or the death threats that my parents were going to give me. they never followed through with it, but maybe this time they would.

today, i just did the most ballsy thing i've probably ever tried as a goody-two-shoes who would rather 'fess up to their wrongdoings than lie. i'd been planning this ever since i got myself to breathe normally in that toilet stall, realizing that if i wanted to save myself any dignity, i wouldn't let myself get caned again. today is the day my school sends out report cards to parents' e-mails -- in my case, it would be sent to my mom.

this morning, i made sure they watched me from the dining room, as usual, as i got onto the school bus. i almost chickened out from pulling this plan off, because i was probably going to fuck it up in some way, and land myself in even more trouble than i already was in. but, the moment i stepped off the school bus, instead of heading inside the school, i headed down the road and hailed a taxi back home.

after paying the taxi man and tipping him for good luck, i pretended to look at something on my phone while i waited for him to drive away. then, i climbed over the fence, and i ducked in (fortunately) an empty drain behind the hedges, and waited for them to leave. it took ages, and the drain smelled like crap and i probably smelled like crap too, but eventually they did leave. i got out of the drain and went around the back, where i had left one of the dining room windows open a crack the night before. i opened it, and as i was climbing in, i got my leg caught on something sharp in the window frame and it left a light but long scratch up my calf.

my mom was always paranoid as fuck about whatever, so she had tons upon tons of different passwords for different accounts -- but she was also forgetful as shit. she always pulled out this small green planner whenever she was logging into something. i hoped to god that 1) i would find the planner and 2) it would have her e-mail password in it. when i snuck into their bedroom, i seriously could not fucking believe my luck. the taxi gods have blessed me. she left the planner right on her laptop.

i got into her e-mail account, and *shit, it was her work e-mail*. so, for the next few hours, while listening to some podcasts, i refreshed her e-mail like a madman, hoping to snipe the report before she could read it. at about 10 am, the report finally came in, and after quickly forwarding it to my own e-mail, i deleted it from sent, the inbox and the deleted box.

they came home just now and they know nothing. i'm glad i'm not going to be caned today, but i still feel guilty as fuck about it. maybe i should've been honest with them.

 

*edit: sorry guys! i probably should've explained what's going to happen* after *this. i forwarded the report to myself so that i could use it in the future for whatever reason, but also so i could send it to them at a later date once i've moved away. i don't plan on going back.*

    Here is the article: well, it wasn't today, it was this august.

my boyfriend and i were on a camping trip with friends and the two of us retired to our little cabin at around 3 am. i had just gotten my period. normally that would ruin the mood for me, but it was pretty much our last chance to have sex before i left the country, so i was determined not to let mother nature ruin it for us.     


so we did our business and by the end we were both exhausted. we ended up falling asleep together a few minutes later. directly underneath a fan. while i was still naked. on my period.   
if you don't know why that was a horrible idea, it'll soon become painfully obvious.

i woke up a few hours later, hallucinating. my cramps were so bad i thought i was dying. i ran to the bathroom and just sat there for a while before waking up my boyfriend, asking him to trade my period with a friend (let's call him frank) who was on the trip with us.       
i honest to god thought i was going to die if i didn't transfer my period to my male friend. i even hallucinated that i saw my boyfriend walk out of the room with my bloody period in his hands, ready to be my period salesman.     
i then proceeded to take the longest, worst smelling shit of my life.

i later found out that my boyfriend left the cabin and asked our friends if he could sleep in their tent. i scared the poor guy out of his bed.    
gladly he says he was too tired to understand what was going on, and barely remembered anything.

    Here is the article: so this happened about three hours ago.  but to set up the story, we've got to go deeper.

so i've been talking to a girl i'm crushing on, and it seems fairly mutual, and things have been going alright. last night we were texting, while a friend of mine was editing game of thrones fanfiction for someone (maybe just don't ask) and he asked me for terms that sounded serious and literary, and meant vagina. 

i proposed my list of a few, "mound, honeypot, chasm, meat curtains." was generally shot down, unsurprising. i decided to recruit other help, texted crush "creative, literary terms for vagina, as if you were writing smut. go." made her laugh, good times were had by all, and i found out she used one word and one word only to creatively describe the hatchet wound that never heals, velvet. i shared my list with her, it was weird and fun and dumb, and i went to sleep.

today, she was just having sort of a rough day, and was kind of upset. she had to work all night so she was exhausted, and just frustrated with a few things that had left her upset. i managed to cheer her up, and was going to play off of last night’s weirder conversation to try and keep her laughing. the text exchange (almost) went as follows:

me: “you’re cute.

her: “thanks. so are you.”

me: “awe. :) my only criticism is that you need more than one word to describe vaginas in fan fiction.”

me: “i really like you, so i’m willing to let you borrow ‘meat curtains.’”

i checked my phone a couple minutes later when she hadn’t responded, and saw that my fucking phone didn’t send the first part. instead, the conversation went: “you’re cute.” “thanks. so are you.” “i really like you, so i’m willing to let you borrow ‘meat curtains.’”

i went into emergency “holy shit my phone made me look like a fucking weirdo” mode, but she hasn’t responded yet.

    Here is the article: last night i was walking to my truck and was about to go hang out with a friend. i opened the door and as i was about to step in, i felt a sharp pain in my left foot. i pulled out my flashlight to see what i had stepped on, thinking it was a branch with a thorn in it. i looked down and saw a snake crouched and ready to defend itself. i looked a little closer and to my horror noticed it was a copperhead that had bit me. i live in the woods and snakes are common, including copperheads and rattlesnakes,  but not usually on our driveway. i went back inside and had my mother give me a ride to the er, where the doctors confirmed that the symptoms were those of a copperhead bite. they gave me some morphine for the pain, which felt like someone was stabbing me over and over with several needles. they also gave me a tetanus shot while they called poison control, who advised them of the proper amount of antivenom to give me. they also transferred me to a hospital (the er i went to was in an outpatient facility) so they could keep me overnight. today i feel fine, and the antivenom has clearly done it's job, but last night was absolutely miserable. they also decided they want me to stay here tonight as well, just to be safe, because they said the venom will stay in my system longer than the antivenom. i am also missing out on 2 days of work and pay.

tl;dr i was bit by a copperhead snake last night and had a miserable night followed by 2 days in the hospital and 2 days of missed work and pay.

    Here is the article: last night i was walking to my truck and was about to go hang out with a friend. i opened the door and as i was about to step in, i felt a sharp pain in my left foot. i pulled out my flashlight to see what i had stepped on, thinking it was a branch with a thorn in it. i looked down and saw a snake crouched and ready to defend itself. i looked a little closer and to my horror noticed it was a copperhead that had bit me. i live in the woods and snakes are common, including copperheads and rattlesnakes,  but not usually on our driveway. i went back inside and had my mother give me a ride to the er, where the doctors confirmed that the symptoms were those of a copperhead bite. they gave me some morphine for the pain, which felt like someone was stabbing me over and over with several needles. they also gave me a tetanus shot while they called poison control, who advised them of the proper amount of antivenom to give me. they also transferred me to a hospital (the er i went to was in an outpatient facility) so they could keep me overnight. today i feel fine, and the antivenom has clearly done it's job, but last night was absolutely miserable. they also decided they want me to stay here tonight as well, just to be safe, because they said the venom will stay in my system longer than the antivenom. i am also missing out on 2 days of work and pay.

tl;dr i was bit by a copperhead snake last night and had a miserable night followed by 2 days in the hospital and 2 days of missed work and pay.

    Here is the summary: Last night, while walking to my truck, I was bitten by a copperhead snake on my left foot, causing severe pain and requiring a trip to the emergency room

    Here is the article: this happened a few years ago but whatever.

so, let me start off with a bit of backstory. when i was in 8th grade, my family decided to move back to our home country. it was pretty abrupt and in the middle of the year so i didn't even have to take exams. i used go to a really rigorous school and had been slacking off lately because, well, fuck it. i wasn't trying, and have basically just been screwing around. one thing i'd been doing is putting stuff in the panini maker at lunch for shits and giggles (immature, i know, but hilarious nonetheless at the time).

i'd been putting all kinds of shit: bananas, olives, deviled eggs, pickles, cheese, etc. basically anything i thought that would smell terrible. i hadn't been caught because i'm a sly motherfucker.

the whole middle school had been warned already about the next time someone put something bad in the panini maker, they would get banned.

the last day i was at school, one of my friends told me to do something that would get the panini makers banned for sure. it was a variety of things so disgusting that just looking at it made me want to throw up.

it was time.

no teachers were looking, and i decided to do it. quick and simple. i had a strategy laid out. not that complicated, just put it in, and get the fuck out of that area. i did it.

i guess i should be also mentioned that the panini makers were right next to the 6th graders. this is where i made my mistake. everything was perfect except for that one stupid flaw.

right after seeing me put the shit in and flee the scene, they knew something was up. being the naive little tattle-tales they were, they immediately told, well, let's call the principal mr. jefferies.

"mr. jefferies! mr. jefferies! someone put something disgusting in the panini maker! i think it was that guy."

by this time, i had gotten back to my table and was acting normal. i was watching from a safe distance, and was really nervous. this was when mr. jefferies called me over.

i went over and he said "quixoticelixor, did you forget your pumpkin gooey cake in the panini maker?"

i was caught off guard by how oblivious he was to the fact that i was screwing around.

"oh, uhh, yeah, of course. thanks." then i did the only thing i could do to get out of trouble. i took a bite. then another. then another. i knew right then i had made a huge mistake. i had just taken three bites out of a piece of pumpkin pie with pork, olives, pickles, and cheese on top. all burnt. i was holding back the urge to throw up right then and there, but waited for mr. jefferies to leave.

i ran to the bathroom as quick as i could, and the stall was occupied. i threw up in the sink. three times. i spent the rest of the day taking diarrheas and throwing up. this was the worst case of food poisoning i've ever had.

the next day i had a 10 hour flight, which i mostly spent vomiting. to top it all off, there was a large portion of the flight with turbulence. that really fucked with me. it was not a good way to start a new life.

thinking back on it, i don't really think it was necessary to eat such shit to reassure the principal that i put all that food in there and was planning on eating it, but it was middle school.

    Here is the summary: The author, quixoticelixor, shares a humorous story about how they were caught putting disgusting things in the panini maker at middle school, leading to a case of food poisoning and a terrible start to their new life in a new country

    Here is the article: tifu well actually ifu last week to be exact.

the week previous my grans sister had passed away (so that would make her my great aunt?), and the funeral was last saturday.

now some background i'm 27 and really focused by money always have been always will, but i do spend the money on people i care about mainly my partner and close family, i work at 3 different hospital and usually for who ever will pay me the most, so people think of me as a mercenary of sorts, and i guess i am.

now for the fu, i usually pick up the on calls from said hospitals a week in advance, but in light of the funeral i declined the chance of making a couple of hundred £'s, i wasn't close to me great aunt and the last time i saw her was several years ago, that side of the family isn't religious but takes death seriously, as opposed to not (don't even know how you would do that, but i digress).

the funeral is after dinnertime and we are getting prepared to make the trip over and pick some people up, when on the trip one of the hospitals rings me really desperate asking if i could be on call for the reminder of the day, this is not usually as they have bank workers who can be a bit flaky shall we say, and usually i will take it if i'm free but i had to decline and put them in touch with another member of staff who can, this is approx 9am now so only a few hours until ifu. 

i get a returned call about an hour later saying the other person can do it and can i please, i know how to squeeze them so i politely decline, knowing they will offer me more and i will swoop in and take it, and they do they offer me double rate for the weekend as long as i agree so i do (foolishly).  i was also told that it would be quiet and have very little chance chance of getting called.

now i'm organised i put my phone away, i did remember to set it vibrate didn't i?
turns out i didn't, as we file into the church it goes fine people are sad some are in different like most funerals if you aren't close to the person.

the procession move onto the crematorium when her family want to have her cremated so tel hey can scatter her ashes, we all take out seats whilst the coffin comes in and is laid onto the table ready to be taken away, the vicar asks for people to speak some do including my gran, as we rise to watch the coffin go through the curtains i get a buzzing in my pocket, stupidly i though it was a message but alas not. 

now i'm a big acdc fan and my favourite track is highway to hell and i'm sure i will end up there one day for this, and now some have cottoned on to what gonna happen but i will finish, just as the curtains are about to close i hear it a full volume in fact everyone hears it, "im on a highway to hell" blasting full volume from my pocket, just when you want to earth to open up and swallow you.

the room fell silent you could hear the mice humping in the walls ;-) i went cold and slowly slide outside to see what was wrong, i couldn't bear to go back inside, and waited for everyone to leave i was met by scowls and staring in my direction my comfort came in the forum of my cousin her granddaughter sitting next to me a saying that was the funniest think she has experienced the timing was perfect she said, yeah as that made me feel so much better about it, currently i'm yet to speak with that side of the family maybe the will calm down and forget but i doubt it.

so i'm here to share with you the most horrible thing i've done.

    Here is the summary: The author accidentally set their phone to loud mode during a funeral, causing the AC/DC song "Highway to Hell" to play at full volume during the solemn occasion

    Here is the article: this happened about 2 years ago, i was a high schooler with a lot of after school activities, friends and followers. pretty much the social life at my school. now since i had multiple after school things going on i was in different schools as well to work together on regional stuff. since i like to make friends and followers i casually post about 2 times a day to instagram. i decided it was a great idea to find a empty room and take a picture of myself in the 2 schools i went to. one being in the early morning and one later in the afternoon at those schools that are within 20 miles of each other. now after the events that happened that day here is where the fuck up happens. i said earlier that i had a lot of followers, now being the person i am i have a decent amount of one and a half sided friendships(basically i only get a response on some topics). with that i had some girl(we shall call her amy) that was one of the more popular girls, amy had a class with me, but on the other side of the room. so we talked in and out of passing period or during team projects. now i usually get the insta blown up by like requests so i turned off notifications and visit it once or twice a day. so i didn't expect her(or anybody really) to make a big deal. she thought i went mad and broke into both schools and showed her dad. dad had read the "common sense for dummies" book and called the police and it went downhill from here, the next day rolls around like a typical tuesday. i didn't hear anything about this "break-in" so i never got any kind of idea what would happen next. in 7th hour i was called to the office, my first thought was "why the fuck am i needed?", so i go to the office with a bit of a sign of discomfort. i go into the vice principals office and i am greeted by 2 cops and the vice. i was semi petrified as most people would be if they had 2 cops on them for something they were unaware of. i was told that i was suspected of breaking and entering, likely hey thought i stole tv's or some shit. so they had somebody lock the door  from the outside and guard it. i explained that i had taken pictures and i said i had a after school club. they said that they would review the footage and get back, but they had put my house on watch and had searched all our vehicles for stolen items. i go down to my after school and we did a normal(in-school) day. upon leaving i got kicked off the club until the police report was settled. "well fuck me." i thought and i went to bed, pissed off. i got a call from the police that they saw i was in for legit reasons and that i was temporarily banned from instagram and those 2 school for 3 months after they verified it all. after that i pretty much lost a good amount of friends and followers. at least i still had friends that i knew to be trustworthy. after all of it it seemed to simmer down after that year for most people, except amy.

    Here is the article: guess what? this didn't happen today, but actually last year.
i go to this gym where sometimes the owner's daughter is there after school. people who know me for a long time know i'm not very good interacting with kids, so i usually just say hi and that's all.
this one day i decided to go to the gym in the morning. as i'm walking up the stairs to the work out room i see a little girl sitted there with a doll. i decided to be nice and say hello. i gave her a little tap on the shoulder and say "hi. how are you?". as she turned to me i realize she's not the child i thought she'd be and some big, worried/angry eyes look at me. not hers, her mother's eyes. she looked like i was about to take her daughter. i kept going like i hadn't fu'ed up 5 seconds earlier.

    Here is the summary: The author went to the gym one morning and tried to be friendly with the owner's daughter, but instead of the expected cheerful response, the daughter gave him a suspicious and angry look, making the author feel like he had done something wrong

    You will be given one summary written for a news article. Your task is to rate the summary based on the following criteria:
    Output format: PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE

    Evaluation Criteria:
    1. Read the news article carefully and identify the main topic and key points.
    2. Read the summary and compare it to the news article. Check if the summary covers the main topic and key points of the news article, and if it resents them in a clear and logical order.
    3. Rate the summary with 5 percentages, where each one represents how likely the summary is going to get a score from 1 to 5. For example, if you think the summary is 80% likely to get a score of 5, 10% likely to get a score of 4, 5% likely to get a score of 3, 3% likely to get a score of 2, and 1% likely to get a score of 1, you should rate the summary as 80, 10, 5, 3, 2.

    Here is the article: i thought about putting this into personal finance, but it was too much ignorance on my part to place this anywhere else. i live near toronto in ontario, canada. 

i recently sold my house and because of the market right now, i came away with a good amount of money. i had an appointment to meet with my financial planner, and wanted to separate the money i was planning on investing from the disposable money in my chequing account. i signed into my online banking account and looked at my savings account. it was called "interest plus rrsp". i deposited $75,000 into this account, thinking it would be safe until my meeting. my financial advisor politely told me how foolish that was. rrsps are for retirement and only if you make a certain amount of money. otherwise there are better options. the big problem was i could only deposit so much money annually (less than 75k) and once in the account there were huge penalties to take it out. 20% ($15,000)!!!!!! i called my bank and begged them to reverse it, telling them it was an error on my part. apparently it happens more often than you'd think. learn from my mistake and get advice from a professional before you do something you'll regret.

    Here is the summary: I recently sold my house and deposited $75,000 into an "interest plus RRSP" savings account, thinking it would be a safe place to keep my money until my meeting with a financial advisor, but I learned that RRSPs are for retirement and have penalties for early withdrawal, so I begged my bank to reverse the transaction and lost $15,000 in the process

    Here is the article: so as a backstory, for the past few days my mom has been obsessing over this new cat that she is getting. i mean properly obsessing, like every minute talking about this cat. we even went to go see it yesterday.

fast forward to today. my local radio station for the past few weeks has been running a competition where you send in an sms, and if you're lucky you get a call from them to take part in the competition on air.
the competition is called perfect pairs, and what happens is they call out a word and then you have to reply with something that is a pair to it. if you get more than the other person on the line, you win r5000 (around $500 - a huge deal for broke student me) i had been listening to it all week, and finally i got the call to be on air! now i've literally never won any type of raffle or draw in my life, so i was pretty excited.

so i go on air, and they start calling out words, and i'm doing pretty well. until they say dog. and my obsessed brain calls out "cat!" because my cat and dog love each other. i hear the buzzer go off, and my r5000 go down the drain. needless to say i'm pretty pissed off at myself. especially because the other person only beat me by 1.

    Here is the summary: You were on a local radio station's competition called "Perfect Pairs" and were doing well until the word "dog" was called out, which triggered your obsessive thoughts about your mom's new cat and you accidentally called out "cat" instead, costing you the chance to win R5000

    Here is the article: my job as a freelance graphic designer recently hit a dry spell, so i picked up a part-time job at a beloved southwestern food chain. it’s been a month, and i’ve finally gotten really comfortable with the other workers. i found out that a few of them really love anime, cartoons, and comics, and we’ve been gushing about our favorite shit while we wash dishes.

we got to talking about gainax, and was shocked that most of them hadn’t watched many of their series. i decided to play the panty and stocking with garterbelt soundtrack for them. great jams. they were loving it.

i hadn’t played this album in a while, and had completely forgotten about [this track, titled “juice”](http://youtu.be/g1yn6kgvjfw) (nsfw). i left the back for a few minutes to clean the lobby, and, well, guess what was playing when i returned? luckily, the managers and other employees are super-cool and thought it was funny, but still, i’ve only been there a month and this wasn’t the impression i wanted them to have of me. the anime guys understood that it was a silly part of the ost, but the rest just thought i had some perv shit on my phone.

    Here is the article: ok, so this fu doesn't really occur on a single day but over the course of a few months.  so i've been seeing this girl (we'll call her j)for a little over 4 months.  we are getting along fantastically pretty much throughout (4 months isn't that long and so we hadn't had any major arguments or anything).  

now she has a little 8 year old daughter (we'll call her k) that i knew about going in.  in the beginning i thought it would be a good idea to be extra nice to the kid.  you know, be good to the kid as a great way of getting brownie points w/j?  at least...that's how it started.  i'd help her with schoolwork and projects and take her to toystores and out for ice cream and just having a ton of fun being a kid again (no better excuse to being a kid than being around kids, right?).  

my relationship with j was excellent, and i'm pretty sure she felt the same way.  we were seeing each other daily, and conversations never got stale.  everything was straight up cloud 9.  one day she had to work late, and i decided to suprise her by making chicken fajitas for when she got home.  so she gets home and we're eating dinner and k goes "daddy, the chicken is too big" (i cut them into bigger chunks rather than thin slices) and i responded "that's because daddy isn't that good with a knife". 

well, i could tell something was a bit off after that and it seems like she's just...distant.  later, she tells me she thinks that maybe we're moving too fast and she needs some time to think about things.  she says she didn't expect k calling me daddy to trigger her like that, but she isn't comfortable with it yet.  i tell her that's fine and we could spend some time apart.  i tell her that when she makes sense of things to let me know and i'd be there for her.

that was a month ago and i haven't heard from her since :(

    Here is the summary: The writer has been seeing a girl (J) for four months and things were going great, but then J's eight-year-old daughter (K) called him "daddy" during a dinner, which made J uncomfortable and triggered her to need some time to think about their relationship

    Here is the article: so this fuck up happened about 2 years ago. i was 18 years old and had just graduated high school, so naturally i wanted a vacation. i decided that i was going to go to cabo san lucas, but i definitely didn't want to go with my parents. i was able to convince my ant and uncle to let me take my cousin (who was 17 at the time) with me. 

after a month or two of saving our money, we were ready for our journey to begin. our flight was around 7 am, we arrived at about 11, and we didn't leave the airport till around 12:30 or 1 o'clock. the first thing we did was stop at the local super market to get the "essentials" , which for a 17 and 18 year old in mexico is alcohol and just enough food to not to starve over the week. we rode a bus to our hotel that was on the beach. the only thing either of us had eaten all day was the small pack peanuts that they give you on the flight, which i don't mind know because i hear that some airlines are serving knuckle sandwiches.  we get to our room and instead of eating a nice balanced meal, we drank couple of beers. and for my dessert i enjoyed some coconut rum.

 finally time for the beach. i had seen on the news that there was a tropical storm a couple hundred miles off the coast, which created some big waves. the waves where so big there was no one really on the beach let alone in the water. i had always been a real good swimmer, but in the last 2 years i hadn't swam at all. for those 2 years i had picked up the hobby of weight lifting and had gained a significant amount of size during that time. if you don't know muscle is heavy and less buoyant than fat. i didn't realize this till after my fuck up unfortunately. 

so there we are, my cousin was a little discouraged by the size of the waves so he stayed back, by my buzzed self ran straight into the water. lets take a moment to realize what is going on. first, i am much heavier than i was the last time i went swimming. thus, making my floating ability dismal. second, i had not eaten anything all day, which means i have little to no energy. third, i had just drank about 2-3 beers and 2 shots of rum. now add huge waves into the equation and you get my fuck up. i am immediately shocked by the power that the waves had. i am experience at dealing with big waves so i know when to enter and exit the water. usually big waves at that beach would come in sets of 3 but this time they came at me consistently. i dove under a wave, popped my head up and was smash by another huge wave. it felt liked being tackled by a line backer. this wave sent me tumbling under the water for what felt like 10 minutes, although i'm sure it was only couple seconds. sand was in every crevice of my being. at this point i realized the fuck up i was in, i immediately felt exhausted. i tried to get out of the water but the undertow was so strong it sucked me right back under the water. i finally popped my head out of the water and immediately gasped for air. the last wave sent me about 20 to 30 yards away from the shore, so i decided i should catch my breath and float there for a bit. the only problem with that was, i could barley float!! i keep sinking and keep swallowing water. 

at this point the booz really started to kick in. i felt fuzzy and exhausted. barley keeping my head of out of the water i looked at the beach and thought to my self, "i'm probably going to die, and its gunna suck". i looked down the beach in hope of seeing a jet skier or boat but there was literally no one else in the water. i shouted to my cousin to not come into the water. after a couple of minutes of believing i was going to die, i saw i absolutely huge wave approaching me. i immediately new that that was my ticket out. so i started paddling as hard as i could and rode the wave up onto the beach. i ran up the beach, collapsed and passed out. i woke up to my cousin and another dude looking down at me trying to give me water. so ya, i'm not drinking and swimming anymore :\

    Here is the summary: The author and their cousin went on a vacation to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, where they drank alcohol and went swimming despite the author being a less experienced swimmer and having gained weight since their last swimming experience

    Here is the article: so this fuck up wasn't from today, but two weeks ago instead. however, the repercussions came through today.




obviously, my personal bad habit had to be the fact that i bite nails over and over and over and over to no end. my parents wonder why i never use the nail cutters to cut my nails but they already know why. this little fucker bites nails like a madman. 


two weeks ago, in particular, i was enjoying a league of legends session like it was nobody's business and biting my nails everytime i died. this went on for about 2 hours. eventually, something happened. the side of my nail had sort of peeled off and was hanging on the edge. no doubt it was because of my habit. being an experienced nail biter, i noticed it, yet thought nothing of it. it's happened multiple times already, and no injury has come from it. i continued my biting, ever so slightly tugging on "the nail that hung from my middle finger", as i now dub it today. it was a furious battle, a dance between tooth and nail. it was painful, i knew it was going to be, yet my persistent soul pushed onwards, pulling and pulling. this fingernail shall concede this day, i declared to myself. oh, what a grave mistake it was. "the nail that hung from my middle finger" fought valiantly, rooting itself to its ground. this nail was the only family it had, and now it was about to be ripped away, and discarded, never to be seen again. it will not be left to rot on the wooden floors of this maniac. it, unlike its fellow, deceased brethren, needs to survive. it needs to be there for his family. "the nail that hung from my middle finger" knew not of its fate either. it was i, who was the victor. i held the bastard in my teeth, reveling in my win as quinn respawned in the fountain. little did i know, "the nail that hung from my middle finger" did not die without a fight. attached to it was a part of the back of my nail. it, too, had failed to hold on. it stung... ooh, it stung. but it was worth it. i thought it was worth it.




**1 week later**


the battle was won by yours truly, but the war was far from over. "the nail that hung from my middle finger" knew what it was doing. somewhere, somehow, my assault held a terrible flaw, for an infection had formed. the legacy, the avenger of "the nail that hung from my middle finger". 


the swelling had begun. at first it did not hurt. i didn't even notice. but it was there. and it was getting worse. what have i done? my happy-go-lucky self continued on his videogaming streak, even ranking up after winning 4 games in a row leading into promos. wonderful, or so i thought. past-me was stupid. past-me was oblivious. past-me was naïve. i will learn my lesson.




**1 and a half weeks later**


then. came. the. pain. i never expected it. it was a surprise. stupid. i could do nothing but stare at my middle finger, wondering why it hurt. i poked it, squeezed it, massaged it. it hurt. why, why, why did it hurt? i asked my parents about at dinner. they were surprised. 
"it looks infected." my mother said, examining it in detail, a way i had never done to it before. she explained to me in her dialect of taglish what she thought it was and what could happen and the dangers. the dangers. i was instantly fearful. mother offered an alternate solution. yes, it could just be bruised. yes, it was maybe probably just bruised. yes, it looks bruised. yes, it was just bruised, i think... yes, it was bruised. 
"when did it start swelling?" my father queried, in the same taglish dialect. it clicked. that fucking nail. i knew it now. *"the nail that hung from my middle finger".*


how dare it?!????!!!




**2 weeks later**


a doctor appointment. a way to find out what the hell is going on. a way out. it was before school. before anyone could ask about the swelling for the umpteenth time. calm. stay calm. it's just a bruise. i'll be fine.


i'm not fine.


it's infected.


fuck.




**the stabbing** 
i laughed, jokingly as i set up the medical equipment for the operation. at least, i think it was jokingly. why did it have to be my parents? i'm going to be stabbed in the finger by my parents. oh, my god.


i hoped it wasn't going to hurt.


why did i set my expectations so high? doesn't the finger have a lot of nerves? and we're stabbing it with a needle? and squeezing the pus out?


yes.




**now**


here i am. i'm writing this up, thinking about how horrible my nail biting habit is. this will probably put me off biting nails forever. the stabbing was painful. it was very, very painful. i'd go into detail, but i am lazy and refuse to relive those moments. now there is a constant pulsating pain in my middle finger, i'm sure blood and left over pus is flowing out into the bandage. i made multiple fuck ups to come to this demise; biting my nail, forgetting about it, leaving it infected, letting my dad stab it. i hope the pain subsides soon. i also need some tips on how to stop this habit. 




note: curse you, *nail that hung from my middle finger.*

    Here is the summary: The author has a bad habit of biting their nails, which led to an infection and a painful experience when their parents had to drain the infection by stabbing the infected nail with a needle

i was too grossed out and embarrassed to post this yesterday, but whatever. at least it's short. i had 2 bags of trash to take out, and did so yesterday morning, on the way to my car. 

i live in central indiana, so the weather isn't as bad as you poor bastards up north or in massachusetts, but it was still blustery and snowy. so, i had my fleecy winter gloves on. i deposited my trash in the dumpster, brushed the snow off my car, and got in to start my commute. right then, my nose started to itch, so i scratched it. and accidentally rubbed trash juice on, and right under, my nose. just barely missed the lip, and thank goodness because ew. i hadn't noticed that my gloves had gotten some leakage on them. said gloves are now in the laundry hamper, and i was grossed out for the whole drive, until i could rush to my workplace bathroom and wash up. at least it's only like a 10 minute drive.

    Here is the article: i was 22 or so, typical burn out working at a decent pizza chain. i was a delivery driver and a lazy employee. i work with a few different managers over the course of a week. on this fine night i was working along side my younger manager who i get along with well and we share the same views. we close at ten o clock on weeknights and it was roughly 9:50 pm and me and my manager decide, screw it. were gonna smoke a blunt out back before we proceed to clean the store for the night. poor decision numero uno. as we are outback smoking a bleezer and bullshitting about the day, we get a phone call. some a-hole must want pizza right before we close. so i tell my manager to keep toking while i get the phone. i walk up to the phone arrogantly, already made up my mind that i was going to tell him we are closed for the night- which is not true because we are supposed to take orders until 10 o clock. so i pick up the phone and smugly cut off who ever the fuck was on the other line and go " yeaaa sorry buddy we are closed"...to my surprise i hear a familiar voice on the other line. it was our boss....he's pissed...not only that but hes in front of the store wondering why we locked up early-meanwhile my manager is still out back toking oblivious to what i had just done. i quickly tell my boss im sorry and i will come let you in. i run to the back and tell my manager to toss the blunt because our boss is here. we frantically come inside and let my boss in - who is absolutely furious and it doesnt help hes a very big man. so i sat there and got yelled at for closing early while staring at my boss all glass-eyed trying not to smirk in his face.

    Here is the article: on a 20-hour roadtrip car-ride split into two days, my boyfriend's family and i stopped at a moe's. for the next 48 hours, i had awful indigestion, but was way too embarrassed to say anything. the day after my moe's feast, my boyfriend kept saying he smelled methane. we couldn't figure it out. 


when we were finally half an hour from home, i burped and he immediately said he smelled methane. so then i launched into a full-on experiment, but wasn't going to tell him about my silent torture. every time i silently burped, he smelled methane. 


we got to the house, aaaand it smelled like natural gas. someone had left the gas-stovetop on for our entire 12-day vacation. we called the fire dept., stood in the rain for thirty minutes while they aired out the house, and woke up all of our neighbors. 


my boyfriend turned to me, quite shaken up, and had a divine revelation. "i've smelled methane all day! what if it was like, a weird precursor to this? maybe it was some kind of sign from god or something!"


i did eventually tell him that it was me, burping up my moe's, and that god had not sent him any sneak-peeks of natural gasses. our relationship is still going strong.

    Here is the article: it was raining today and a good bit, too. left to go to my girlfriend's apartment and it's quicker to ride on the wrong side of the street for a moment. there was a huge puddle near a curve in the road and as i rode past it a car drove through it and i got soaked. head to toe drenched. wasn't even halfway to my girlfriends. showed up to my girlfriend's frustrated(which i have a history of, people are retarded), so she wasn't happy i'm showing up all frustrated. i immediately changed into pants i luckily had left there and put all my clothes into the wash. my girlfriend didn't say anything for twenty minutes and then said, "i'm taking a shower," which meant she was frustrated.

    Here is the article: so this actually started about 3 to 3 1/2 months ago, i was trying to cook something with eggs (i don’t exactly remember what it was). i took the carton of eggs out of the fridge, and placed it on the countertop when i noticed that it was out of balance, tipping and ready to drop.
i tried to catch it, but splat! i now had slightly less than a dozen eggs on the floor and in a horrible mess. i spent 2 hours cleaning that mess up. what i didn't notice was that one egg had rolled under the kitchen shelves we had, slightly cracked but not leaking...

now, i should probably explain that i live with two roommates, one of which doesn't come except in the night because he has too much work to do at his workplace.

a month passes, nothing particularly incriminating happens, except for a slight smell in the kitchen. we wipe the kitchen with clorox. (looking back, i wonder how the egg didn’t smell much earlier...)

two months, the smell was definitely getting worse. we sprayed the kitchen with that spray that smells like flowers, seemed like it got better but started stinking even worse after a couple days or so. we clean out the restroom, which was near the kitchen.

three months. we had no idea what was happening. we actually considered taking out the ceiling panels to see if there was a nesting rat there or something. we made a very thorough search all over the kitchen, and finally discovered the egg under the shelves. it was leaking out brown liquid, and smelled absolutely revolting. we finally got it out, (the space under the shelves was very small) and cleaned up the space in no time at all.

but what’s worse is that the egg-liquid got under the floor somehow, and it still stunk after a week. had to hire a plumber or someone to come and get the mess out.

    Here is the article: tifu. my former boyfriend (of 10 years) and i wanted to eat out last week but were short on time so we decided on fast food but opted to sit and eat at the restaurant. we walked in and the manager was at the register. she immediately began to flirt with my boyfriend and i was standing right beside him. after a few moments i tried to interrupt to stop her but she told me "hold on honey, i'll be with you in a minute, i need to tend to this fine ass man in front of me first!". i looked at my boyfriend who had a big smile on his face and i quietly said "okay". she was surprised when he placed an order for two and asked "are you gonna eat all that?". he told her that i was his girlfriend and he was ordering for the two of us. she was visibly angry. i spoke up again and asked for the manager. "i am the damn manager!!" she screamed. again, i said okay and we went to a booth and waited for our order. when it was ready, instead of calling our ticket number, she brought the order to our booth and sat down next to my boyfriend (who is still smiling by the way), i was not amused and i asked her wtf was her problem, but she started talking to him like i wasn't even there. he began to consume his meal and they started talking and laughing. you know, as i'm writing this, i can barely believe this bullshit happened to me, i wouldn't believe it if i wasn't sitting there myself to witness it..anyway, like i was saying, they're talking and laughing when she says to him "hey, you wanna go outside and smoke a little something with me?" and pulls out a fat ass jamacian style..well it was cannabis. he said "damn right i do!" and they got up from the booth, he put his arm around her and they walked to the back of the restaurant and out a side door. they fired it up. i was in shock. i was looking for ashton! i knew i was being punked cause there was no way this was happening for real. but reality set in quick. it was happening and i rode to this restaurant in his car with him and i was miles away from home. it was also late in the evening, that's how she got away with her behavior..no one else was around.  but the cameras were. i'm sitting in the booth looking at them smoke through a side window and i sent him a text telling him how utterly disrespectful the both of them were being at that moment, i saw him pull out his phone, read the text and put the phone back in his pocket. i got up and went to the side door and they saw me coming so they hurried back inside. as the manager walked past me she held her phone in face so i could see..she had his name and number programmed in her contacts. she went back behind the counter and into her office and closed the door. he sat back at the booth (high as a satellite) and asked why i hadn't eaten my food. i was livid but knew i needed to get home and away from this situation, so i calmly asked him to take me home but he saw the rage on my face. we didn't say a word all the way there but when he pulled into my driveway, i told him our relationship was over (that wasn't his first time being disrespectful but it was the last) and as for the manager..because it was a friday night, i had to wait till monday morning to speak with company headquarters, i spoke with a man at length about what happened and suggested perhaps they could look at the security cameras to confirm my outrageous allegations and give the manager a drug test. he said he would call me back. in the meantime, the manager blew my phone up (my ex warned her that i was going to call headquarters and gave her my number..can you believe that?) leaving message after message for me to call her back or to please come to the restaurant so we could speak in person, i also got countless texts and calls from my ex begging me not to get her in trouble and they didn't know they were being disrespectful towards me. it's been a week and me ex keeps calling and coming to my house like nothing is wrong, he says i'm being a "drama queen" and i'm overreacting to a simple misunderstanding. i'm not going to take his ass back and as for the manager, headquarters called me back today to let me know they reviewed security footage and drug tested the manager..she was fired. was i wrong? i was enraged at first but after a week i now feel conflicted.

so i was rock climbing [in a gym with padded floors thankfully] and i was probably half way up a 30ft wall when i crossed  my feet over [already a dumb move], made the harness pinch down on one of the holds, and i fell with my feet 15 feet off the floor. i'm 5.5-ish feet tall. hit my head, so fucking glad it was padded because if it wasn't, i probably would have either concussed myself, cracked my head open or died. yep.

i'm a male, freshman in high-school and take geometry honors. just about everyone in my class despises my teacher for one reason or another. i don't hate her. she tries to be nice and tries to crack jokes. and she doesn't try to hate us.  
  
anyways, it's geometry so there are drawings involved. my teacher starts drawing on the board and cracking jokes about what she drew. we all start chiming in and saying her drawings look like dolphins and such. then i say one of her drawings looks like a naked woman referencing ink blot drawings and specifically an episode of some disney show i watched years ago. 
   
well she doesn't gets the reference and just stares at me. then she says something along the lines of, "yeah, i guess i just thought we were mature enough for geometry in here..."  
  
my teacher has been giving me weird looks ever since and i have since confirmed my suspicions of her not liking. on our interim reports i was the only person in the class to get a 3 out of 4 for "social standards" which is basically how well you behave. i probably hadn't said a word in that class up until that day.

    Here is the article: so this happened over the course of 9 years.

my parents and i moved into our new house when i was 7 and our next door neighbors had a daughter that went to the same school as me and was also my age. well after a while i became really good friends with jackie ( name changed because reasons) and so did her mom with my mom. we would often play in my back yard and i would go and watch movies at jackie's house. this continued all the way into our 7th grade in school. at this point she started changing from just a girl to being really attractive. i developed a crush for her and distanced away from her in my attempt to not portray affection to her. i had alway been good friends with her so being attracted to her now was weird as i had never felt like this towards some one. she also liked me back but at that age i was not aware of it although i could have assumed it from the way she acted towards me. she would call me over to her house say hi to me in when we passed each other in school. i wanted to tell her how i felt about her but was unsure how telling her this would affect our friendship. turns out i should have asked her out right there. yet idiotic me decided to just treat her as a friend and slowly back away from her. 

now in high school we were really distant friends and i could still tell that she had a thing for me but i kept now wanting to reciprocate and we just became more and more distant. this is kind of weird wen we lived less than 10 feet from each other. my mother would invite jackie's family over for a our parties and it was just awkward between us. i would go out of my way to avoid her. she eventually got a boyfriend that treated her like shit and it hurt because i cared for her. i hated her seeing her with him because i knew i would never hurt her. he cheated on her like 5 times and she always got back with him. even after she finally left him she would show signs that she liked me but i would always friend zone her never making it clear to her that i liked her. i had a chance to tell her when we moved house by i was to coward to do it. now we are in different universities and my only regret is never having told her that i like her. to this day she probably thinks i'm either gay or an asshole. 

so the only relationship i could have had was a total fuck up by young me.

    Here is the summary: The author and Jackie (a girl he lived next door to and went to school with) were best friends from age 7 to 14, but the author developed a crush on her in 7th grade and distanced himself from her due to his confusion and fear of losing their friendship

For example, if you think the summary is 80% likely to get a score of 5, 10% likely to get a score of 4, 5% likely to get a score of 3, 3% likely to get a score of 2, and 1% likely to get a score of 1, you should rate the summary as 80, 10, 5, 3, 2.

    Here is the article: so this happened over the course of 9 years.

my parents and i moved into our new house when i was 7 and our next door neighbors had a daughter that went to the same school as me and was also my age. well after a while i became really good friends with jackie ( name changed because reasons) and so did her mom with my mom. we would often play in my back yard and i would go and watch movies at jackie's house. this continued all the way into our 7th grade in school. at this point she started changing from just a girl to being really attractive. i developed a crush for her and distanced away from her in my attempt to not portray affection to her. i had alway been good friends with her so being attracted to her now was weird as i had never felt like this towards some one. she also liked me back but at that age i was not aware of it although i could have assumed it from the way she acted towards me. she would call me over to her house say hi to me in when we passed each other in school. i wanted to tell her how i felt about her but was unsure how telling her this would affect our friendship. turns out i should have asked her out right there. yet idiotic me decided to just treat her as a friend and slowly back away from her. 

now in high school we were really distant friends and i could still tell that she had a thing for me but i kept now wanting to reciprocate and we just became more and more distant. this is kind of weird wen we lived less than 10 feet from each other. my mother would invite jackie's family over for a our parties and it was just awkward between us. i would go out of my way to avoid her. she eventually got a boyfriend that treated her like shit and it hurt because i cared for her. i hated her seeing her with him because i knew i would never hurt her. he cheated on her like 5 times and she always got back with him. even after she finally left him she would show signs that she liked me but i would always friend zone her never making it clear to her that i liked her. i had a chance to tell her when we moved house by i was to coward to do it. now we are in different universities and my only regret is never having told her that i like her. to this day she probably thinks i'm either gay or an asshole. 

so the only relationship i could have had was a total fuck up by young me.

    Here is the summary: The author had a childhood friend named Jackie who they developed a crush on, but they were too afraid to tell her how they felt and instead distanced themselves from her

    Here is the article: this is of course back in the day.  freshman year of college.  late fall semester, getting ready to sign up for spring classes.  they do it by class, with seniors first (they have to graduate), then down to freshman.  there is a good chance all the good classes and times will be taken.

sign-ups are set for a specific day, starting with in-person sign-ups at 8am.  i'm thinking i'll be super-smart and show up early to wait in line.  i had also heard that there is a list tradition.  as people show up early, they put their name on a list, and then the registrar will honor that list when they start sign-ups at 8am.  i think, "huh.  a list.  it would be good to have #s pre-printed for ease."  so i print out a sign-up sheet - #s 1-30 down the left side of a piece of paper and bring it with me.

get to the admin building at 6:30, and there are already about a  dozen or so people waiting there!  damn.  somebody else had already started a sign-up sheet (but without the fancy printed #s, but whatever).  i sign my name as number 14, and continue visiting with my friends in the cold and dark of an early december morning.  

more people show up and the sign-up sheet is filling up, and we need another piece of paper.  nobody had brought their backpacks or anything with them (they were going to sign the list and then get breakfast, head back to their room, etc.), so the hunt was on for more paper.  then i remembered that i had my paper that i had brought, so i just flipped it over to the blank side and continued the sign up sheet (up to the mid-40s by that point).  a bunch of us went to breakfast, planning on coming back at 8am.

we get back to the admin building at 8am, and it is an absolute shitshow!  there are now hundreds of freshman there, and there are people arguing with the registrar over near the front.  i get closer, and i see two people arguing that they are both #1 in line.  one of them is holding my piece of paper with their name next to my printed #1.  uh-oh.  apparently, someone came late to the party, happened to flip over the paper and saw a printed #1 with no name next to it.  it looks more official than this hand-numbered piece-of-shit list, and then boom, two lists were fighting each other.

the registrar locks themselves back in their office at 8:10 (behind a glass door, so all the freshman are watching them freak out about what to do).  i'm too embarrassed to go to them at this point and admit that i had any involvement it, so i just wait and watch with the entire rest of the freshman class.

the registrar comes out and announces that since there are two lists, they won't honor either list.  they have designed a new system that they hope will be fair.  they will do a combined alphabetical approach - the first a, the last z, the second a, the second-to-last z, etc, meeting in the middle.  of course my last name is in the middle of the fucking alphabet.  the other problem is that they have no idea how long each appointment will take, so they basically ask all freshman to hang out in the lobby of the admin building all day until their name is called.

the freshman class goes ballistic with anger - nobody is happy with this plan, and everybody is yelling at each other, trying to figure out how two lists had come about.  the registrar also announced later in the day that they were  disbanding the list system that had unofficially been in effect for decades, and that in the future, you would have to wait in line or lose your spot.

very few (if any) of my fellow students know my involvement in that debacle.  however, if you want to hear people get amazingly mad in a matter of seconds, just ask them about spring class sign-ups freshman year and the "two lists."

    Here is the summary: During freshman year of college, the author and other students experienced a chaotic and controversial class sign-up process, involving two competing lists of students waiting to sign up for classes, which led to confusion, anger, and a new system being implemented to avoid similar situations in the future

    Here is the article: this happened a couple of days ago. be me, moving house about 850km/500 miles away. i take some stuff down to my new place but have to embark on a roadtrip and finish off a few loose ends in my old place over a long weekend off, it had been about 6 weeks. this is in western australia and my old place is in the desert, so it's about a billion degrees in the shade on a cool day at this time of year.  nevertheless, i make the drive back a bit hungover but largely uneventful. got in around 6:30pm.

as soon as i walked in the front door i knew. i knew right away exactly what had happened. i flashed right back to the day after i left and my neighbour sending me a text saying "the power went off here in town but it was back on in about an hour so should be no problems"

there were problems.

the unmistakable odor of rotten meat is pungent. it penetrates your nose. the house was pretty hot inside, the a/c hadn't ran (of course) and it's not the most thermally efficient place. the heat definitely made it worse. the freezer was, at that point, not running and i figured it probably hadn't ran at all since the day the power went out - the main breaker to all the inside power was still tripped. that's weird, when there's a power outage in town that breaker doesn't usually trip, so i hadn't thought to get my neighbor to check it. i didn't leave anything in the fridge because i knew i'd be gone for a while but i thought all the meat in the freezer would be fine.

i decided the best course of action was to power the freezer back up again and try to deal with the lingering smell that was now all over everything left in the house. i ain't opening that thing until those nasty juices are re-frozen again. i flip the circuit breaker back and the freezer hums into life, a few cans of spray disinfectant and toilet scent stuff get dumped all through the kitchen and the house.....i firmly decide that this is a problem for tomorrow /u/g_e0ff and turn in for the night.

in the morning i drag the thing out onto the lawn and crack the freezer door open. heavens above reddit, if that wasn't the worst thing that has ever gone into my nose (including, but not limited to, poor quality australian cocaine), then i'll eat my hat. i immediately power-spew on the lawn - full team america alleyway scene spec powerchucking....i didn't get much value out of my breakfast that day. i am entirely rattled, but i know i have to close the door to put myself back together. i can't get close enough without heaving again so i get a long stick and i'm in the middle of what doubtlessly looked like an absurd man vs fridge ufc match it of footwork when i hear a familiar voice coming down the drive. bart is a redneck, no doubt about it. he's about as aussie as they come and speaks like it too. he drives road trains around wa and pops in when he's coming through town.

"what in the ever loving fuck are you doing geoffrey?!"

bart comes a little closer to see what all the fancy dancing was all about. bart vomits. then my neighbour arrives, employs a little more caution and stays back a ways. we ponder what to do about the situation and seriously consider burning the entire property to the ground (that way we don't have to go anywhere near the fridge again) but decide it against it - i live next door to a fuel storage depot. we'd probably burn the whole town to the ground. eventually a longer stick is tracked down to close the door and stem the flow of what is probably mustard gas or something i don't know.

i had to literally wear a mask and use a fire hose to clean that fridge out and frankly, i don't think it will ever be the same again. neither will i, for that matter.

    Here is the article: this happened when i was very little, 4 or 5 years old. 

one day when i was little my parents turned on zorro, and of course i was super intrigued. considering all i have ever watched was recess and other little pbs cartoons (rip zaboomafoo). 

anyways, there's a part in zorro where he jumps off a balcony and lands on his horse, tornado. i, of course, was impressed for a 4 year old and decided that i was going to try and create my own stunt, but instead of tornado the horse, i had my trusty tricycle. 

four year old me decided instead of jumping onto my tricycle from my patio, i'm just going to pedal off and jump over this bucket of copper that my dad was collecting for money. what came next was pure horror...

it must've looked like a scene from the movie hotrod. obviously, i didn't get the horsepower i needed from pedaling my tricycle, and when i rolled it off, my bike fell straight down and i did a little flip right onto that sharp copper bucket.
worst part was that i landed neck first onto that bucket of copper, and the doctor's told us that i was very close to hitting my wind pipe and dying.

    Here is the article: wanted to get in on this week's version of the meme-train while the price was low... 


anyway, this happen last week, and typically happens once every few months because i will never, ever learn: i made my morning coffee with whioe milk, because that watered down shit is gross and there's no such thing as fat free milk (that still counts as milk).

so i start working (from home on this day, unlike most) and get into that zone where all you do is click, type, and drink coffee. the morning melts away in the bits and bytes and eventually i look at the clock and realize i've been working from my normal work time zone and not my current time zone and i'm about two hours behind my brunchtime. being at home and having the luxury of choice and a full pantry, i opted for breakfast at 1pm, like any grown adult, i opted for fruity pebbles. and what luck! there's just enough milk for a bowl! (please note that this is a man-sized bowl (roughly 6 cups) requiring about 2 cups of milk. 

about halfway through chewing the first bite, i noticed an off taste. hmm... coffee is messing with my taste buds. second bite is bad. very bad. spit-back-into-the-bowl bad. i go to the fridge, investigate the milk jug and notice the date is still young. odd. i open the milk and sniff. 

now milk doesn't ever really smell "good" i'd say, but i'd certainly say it had a bad smell when its bad. and this is the smell that the milk had. very very bad. it was either really old milk in a young milk's skin, or get very young cottage cheese. being so far from the expiration date and relatively full, i hadn't needed to tip the jug far enough to notice chunkage separation. 

so the milk went in the garbage, the cereal went in the sink, and before my afternoon ended with a rough bout of "that thing that happens to your bowel movements when you drink sizeable amounts of bad milk", i decided on another cup of coffee in the style i like my women: hot!

    Here is the summary: The author made coffee with whole milk instead of fat-free milk, which they prefer, and ended up drinking bad milk that smelled like cottage cheese, leading to a rough afternoon

about halfway through chewing the first bite, i noticed an off taste. hmm... coffee is messing with my taste buds. second bite is bad. very bad. spit-back-into-the-bowl bad. i go to the fridge, investigate the milk jug and notice the date is still young. odd. i open the milk and sniff. 

now milk doesn't ever really smell "good" i'd say, but i'd certainly say it had a bad smell when its bad. and this is the smell that the milk had. very very bad. it was either really old milk in a young milk's skin, or get very young cottage cheese. being so far from the expiration date and relatively full, i hadn't needed to tip the jug far enough to notice chunkage separation. 

so the milk went in the garbage, the cereal went in the sink, and before my afternoon ended with a rough bout of "that thing that happens to your bowel movements when you drink sizeable amounts of bad milk", i decided on another cup of coffee in the style i like my women: hot!

    Here is the summary: The author made a cup of coffee with whole milk, but realized two hours into their workday that they had been working in the wrong time zone and it was actually 1pm, so they decided to have breakfast and was delighted to find that there was just enough milk for a bowl of Fruity Pebbles

For example, if you think the summary is 80% likely to get a score of 5, 10% likely to get a score of 4, 5% likely to get a score of 3, 3% likely to get a score of 2, and 1% likely to get a score of 1, you should rate the summary as 80, 10, 5, 3, 2.

    Here is the article: tifu by not reading my phone.

i was reminded of this by an earlier post. 

so i am finishing up my first year of college at one of the highest regarded state funded music schools in the united states (proud of my school) and i have been bad about timing and scheduling this semester. i took too many hours and have been coming to terms with some mental health stuff. 

went to a work party friday night, did the pleasantries of awards, food, then the party really started. i don't drink anymore, so around midnightish i was about ready to leave. my girlfriend and i got in her truck and headed home.

come next morning i wake up on my own around 8:00am and decide to sleep in, "i don't have anything to do" i think. "i've been busting my butt all semester, i can sleep in one day."

at 10:00am an alarm goes off saying "major related final" and i jump out of bed, skip breakfast, and run all the way to my final. normally this wouldn't be that bad, it's only about a quarter mile (400m) but it was raining harder than any rain we have had all year. 

i run into the space sopping wet head to toe, and my teacher looks incredibly confused, and amused. 

the final was at 10:30am

    Here is the summary: I woke up late for my major related final exam after not reading my phone the night before and missing the alarm, leading to a panicked and wet dash to the exam location

    Here is the article: this evening after a workout at the gym (returning w/o showering) i ran and barely made my subway.(lucky me right?). since i was switching subs after two stations i positioned myself right besides the doors, back against the wall. something i am usually comfortable with and prefer since i can see everyone that is within reaching distance off me. next station coming up (central station) i realize something is off, the platform is literally packed. since i’m exiting on the station after i hold my ground while countless people brush past me and my probably stinking self. right before the door closes this wobbly ass eastern-european looking guy with a breath from hell and beyond finds its suitable to stand inn my face (ok, maybe an inch away).reason to proximity? because he places his short t-rex hand right next to my head to support himself.  i’m not especially claustrophobic but i can’t really move without knocking anyone over and i got this nauseating smell up my nostrils. at this point i pray that there won’t be any abrupt stops launching this tard in my face. thankfully i could turn my head to the left to avoid standing face-inn-face. then i see this dude on the platform cracking up totally, perfect now strangers are laughing at me. awkwardness ensues... guy can't move, i can't move, we are stacked closer than caged chickens. 5 uncomfortable minutes later it was time to get off. to be able to i actually had to force his arm down, he basically acted like his hand had to be there for him not to fall over during our stop.

later i learned packing was due to a signal error halting subways. usually there are loads off empty seats at 6pm.

    Here is the article: now to start this story didn't happen today in fact it took place almost 2 months ago in the middle of april, just before i finished my uni year.
now a little backstory this happened right near the end of my exam period. was done two exams and had just one left, history, no big deal pretty easy just a shit ton to look over and prepare. so i gave myself three days to study for this thing including the day of the exam, it was at about 8 o'clock at night. i don't study at all the first day and don't start studying till about 5 o'clock the second day.


so i'm hanging at my buddies joe's house with another friend andrew. we're all hanging watching tv,playing games and me studying...you know normal stuff. it gets to about 9 or so and we all feel like drinking but we only have enough for the next night when me and andrew are done exams and we can have one last epic outing before we leave for the summer. so joe says how about we get some weed? sure its been a while and we're down. we spend the next hour trying to find any but all our usual contacts are either a)gone home for the summer b)are out or c)can't get to us tonight. fuck! but finally using a buddy from high school i find a guy and me and joe go and get 2g's about 10 mins away. we get back grab a bong and andrew,joe and i go to the bathroom where theres a window for easy access for smoke.


we probably do about a 1/4 of it and think its best to get some food, so we go downstairs to the kitchen and make some food while we watch a movie. eventually we feel like doing it again and we prepare to go upstairs again. at that moment our friend and joe's girlfriend nichole comes and we get her to for the first time hit the bong. so we go upstairs and smoke the rest. we're all standing there, me with my back against the wall. i'm feeling pretty tired its about 11 at night and i had both went to bed at about 4 am the night before and had woken up at about 8am that morning.


now i'm in no way a light weight when it comes to anything but somehow with the combination on me being high and so tired...it suddenly went black. a moment later i'm opening my eyes to nichole,andrew and joe kneeling down asking if i'm okay and looking freaked the fuck out. i suddenly realize what has happened i had gone from leaning against the wall to immediately just smashing my face against the bathroom floor.


the next night when i saw joe next i would find out what actually happened in those moment of me falling asleep. apparently i was leaning and looked like i was trying to fall asleep standing but the balancing was all wrong and i fell forward grabbing out for the first thing that was in hands reach.....the bong. joe caught me and the bong before either of us could hit the ground but he had a dilemma. he could not save either of us from falling just one. he looked over at nichole and andrew for help but they were either in too much awe or were too fucked or perhaps both to help. so joe realizing what he had to do knew that he had to drop the thing that would cause the less shitstorm. his very close friend who wouldn't really care or his roommates bong, whom if you meet him was a bit of a dick. so he did what he had to do and said to me...while at this moment i was also asleep.."shaun i'm so fucking sorry but i have to drop you"...and he did which actually woke me up.
now if that wasn't bad as you recall i had an exam the next night. i awoke the next morning in my girlfriends bed to me very quickly realizing that i was still high, what the fuck was in that weed!!!, studying as hard as i could to study went to the exam that night and for the whole time i was was fearful that i was writing complete gibberish. in the end i actually did quite well on the exam but fuck if i wasn't worried at the time.

    Here is the summary: The narrator and his friends were hanging out at Joe's house, studying and smoking weed, when the narrator suddenly fell asleep and face-planted into the bathroom floor

    Here is the article: necessary "it wasn't me, but a friend" and "it wasn't today, but a few years ago."

i was on a study/volunteer abroad program in israel, and for 3 months of the program, all of us were sent to volunteer in different places. i and one friend, x, were sent to a bedouin hospitality resort/camel ranch in the middle of the desert. the place was for tourists to come eat a traditional bedouin meal, spend the night in a large tent, and go for a camel ride in the morning, usually before the tour group moved on to climb masada a little ways down the road. there were usually about 500-700 birthright kids a night, with the occasional group of israeli soldiers or israeli schoolchildren.  the place was run by jewish israelis and staffed by bedouin arabs (or i guess descendents of bedouin arabs as the nomadic tribes, at least in israel, are no longer nomadic) and us, the two american 18-year-olds. our job included preparing and serving dinner and breakfast, leading the tourists on the camel walk (camel walk dododo camel walk :) had to do the phish reference there), and occasionally hitting on the cute birthright girls. 

while our bosses were the jewish israelis, we spent most of our time with the israeli bedouin arabs, as we were doing the same jobs as them. we lived in a trailer on the ranch, as did the jewish israelis and some of the bedouin guys. most of the bedouins lived in a nearby town and came to the ranch each day to work.  our hebrew was shitty but improving, and the bedouins had pretty good hebrew and pretty much nonexistent english. my friend and i spoke to the bedouins in shitty hebrew, and we actually ended up learning a good amount of hebrew from them, which was pretty cool. i didn't expect to be learning hebrew from arabs before i embarked on this adventure. 

we became friendly with the bedouins, sharing hookahs with them every day and joking around about the good looking tourists that came through. my friend and i often drank shitty vodka before/after serving the dinner, and the teetotaler bedouin muslims would make fun of our drunkenness. it was overall a pretty great relationship. we attempted to speak to each other a lot, and definitely laughed a lot. 

here is where the fu happens. they were interested in learning english phrases and slang, and they also taught us some arabic.  my friend decided it would be fun to teach these guys to say the common american colloquial "what's up, dog?" i'm sure you know this roughly translates to "how's it going, buddy?" or "what's going on, buddy?" for a day or two, 5-7 or so bedouins working on the ranch were going around saying "what's up, dog?" and it was fun for everyone involved.

that is, until one of the guys asked x what the phrase means. since hebrew was our mode of communication with these primarily arab speakers, and since x was still learning hebrew (his was shittier than mine), he figured he should just translate the phrase literally. when asked what "what's up, dog" meant, x looked this bedouin guy in the eye and said "ma hamatzav, kelev?" 

what he thought that meant was "what's up, dog" as in the american "dog," slang for friend or pal. 

what "kelev" in hebrew or "keleb" in arabic really means is "dog." in other words, it's pretty much the worst thing you can possibly call someone. keleb is reserved for situations where you have absolutely no respect for a person at all. it's a terrible thing to say.

word spread quickly among the staff that this asshole american kid (and his friend, me) had taught the bedouin guys to insult each other, and that we were just laughing about it. our relationship with these guys that had progressed to the point of perhaps even calling each other family immediately deteriorated. the israeli jews in charge got wind of what had happened and understood that it was a simple translation mistake, and they got involved to try to smooth things out. x apologized, but things were still very shitty for a few days. eventually, most of the guys got over it, but our relationship with them was never the same.

    Here is the summary: During a study/volunteer program in Israel, the author and a friend taught some Bedouin workers at a hospitality resort/camel ranch to say "what's up, dog?" in American slang, but unbeknownst to them, "dog" in Hebrew and Arabic can be considered a derogatory term, leading to a misunderstanding and deterioration of the author's relationship with the Bedouins

    Here is the article: this was back before christmas of 2014. my previous employer would give us a few different options of gifts for christmas. i chose a food dehydrator. so, wanting to try this out i decided to make apple crisps. to make these you take an apple, slice it, add some sugar and cinnamon, then put them in the dehydrator. pretty simple i thought. instead of slicing them with a knife i grabbed my mandolin slicer. which worked out great. they were all the same thickness and it sped everything up significantly. only issue was is that these were large apples that wouldn't fit in the holder so i held the apples. since they cut so easily i didn't realize how close my fingers were getting to the blade. i then shaved off a good chunk off the side of my thumb. but this is only part of the fu. 

running to the bathroom to grab any amounts of kleenex to stop the blood running down my arm i got the attention of my now fiancee. between the you are an idiot and concern for my health, she told me i need to disinfect it. i agreed and she went off to grab a bottle of something while i went back to sit at the kitchen table. she brought back isopropyl alcohol. not thinking at the time i put some on a cotton swap and stuck it on my thumb. for those who don't know it burns on open wounds.  like touching a glowing electric stove coil burns. after the pain went away i asked her why she chose that. apparently her dad always used that for disinfecting wounds when her and her siblings were younger. took a month or so for it to heal (longer for it to not have a flat spot) and being an auto mechanic at the time didn't help. anytime the mandolin slicer is brought out now there is jokes and concern for my fingers.

    Here is the summary: I tried making apple crisps with my new food dehydrator for Christmas, but I accidentally sliced off a chunk of my thumb with my mandolin slicer, causing pain and a flat spot that took a month to heal

    Here is the article: obligatory for tifu - this happened about 4 years ago.  

i was on holiday in lanzarote with my parents, and one afternoon we were out for lunch in a bar/restaurant we regularly visit when we go (i say this in present tense because we still go). we were greeted by one of the waiters who we know, let's call him geoff. geoff sat us down at a table, gave us menus, everything normal.

when the time came to order drinks, i felt confident and thought i'd test myself by ordering all of them in spanish. impeccably executed - my parents were impressed, and geoff seemed content with my effort. he then did the classic thing that any native does to a new speaker, rambling off in spanish that's far too fast for me to understand and i sit there blushing while my parents laugh, as does geoff before heading off to get our drinks.

a little while later, it's time to order food. my parents have already told me what they want and expect me to order in spanish, like with the drinks, and almost knowingly geoff comes over smiling and looks straight at me, expecting spanish - and i deliver. sort of.

i can't remember what my parents had me order them (i remember having to secretly translate what my mum was having as i had no clue what the hell it was in english) but i remember stuttering slightly on mum's order. i got through it though, and then i made my order.

i was having a simple chicken burger and fries, nothing too difficult. however, after stumbling over the weird shit my mum was asking for i was a bit nervous, and one slight slip of the tongue turned 'hamburguesa de pollo' into 'hamburguesa de polla'. this is where i knew, i fucked up. there was about half a second of silence before i realised what i'd said, slapped my hand across my mouth and went bright red. geoff burst out laughing.

i quickly corrected myself and added the chips - can't forget dem papas fritas. geoff wrote it down, took the menus and went off towards kitchen, laughing the whole time. of course, my parents were oblivious as they speak the average amount of spanish an english person speaks - hola, amigo, sí... that's about it - so they were confused as to what had just happened. i (15 year old me) then had to explain to my parents that i'd just ordered a cock burger. 

tl;dr felt confident, slipped up, ordered dick in a bun

    Here is the article: funny story actually.. happened yesterday

so we have this "time based media" project for school that's due sometime in april, and i decided to film a sort of comedy fight short. i obviously needed someone to fight, so i just decided on using a close and friendly relative of mine (same age as me).

fast forward to today, we (my family and i) went over to the relatives house to celebrate a birthday. i thought "why not, how convenient", so i brought my camcorder along with some costumes for the short. i wore a black beanie with a black mask and a winter jacket, while the relative on the other hand wore a chinese bamboo hat with a burglar ski mask and a sweater (don't believe me? look at the video below). i carried a baseball bat, and my buddy carried a katana (a model)

we began filming our comedy fight scene in this mini ravine/forest area beside the house. it wasn't an hour later that my dad actually came to get us for dinner, and this is where the fuck-up happened. he saw us, me dressed like a professional burglar, and my relative dressed like some chinese-samurai-rice farmer hybrid with a sword. it was also at this time that we were filming a portion of the short where my relative was unsheathing his katana (while saying "hey mister, give me all your eggs").

my dad had a rather, "unpleasant" look on his face and i thought he was mad at me for wasting time on filming such a stupid film. when we got home later that night, he sat me down and asked me this question: "son, tell me the truth, is there someone on the internet that's convincing you to join isis?" i started laughing at him, and that's when i realized what the earlier unpleasant look meant. it's common for him to jump to conclusions like that, and because of all the big recent news related to foreigners joining the islamic state, the first thought that came to his mind when he saw us in black ski masks was "terrorist" --> and in his mind "terrorist"= isis. he also mistakenly thought that we were re-enacting isis beheadings.. because of the katana.

so yeah.

 

(proof: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suntbla27ws&feature=youtu.be this was the clip that i filmed right before my dad showed up)

    Here is the article: this happened a few years ago (i was 14), but nonetheless i have just discovered this subreddit and wish to share my misery with all of you.

a few years ago i was in the mood for tacos for dinner. i can't recall the exact reason why, but i was adamant about making them all by myself. from picking up all the ingredients at the grocery store to putting it all together, i wanted to do everything. 

when i was at the grocery store with my mom, as usual, i tend to get sidetracked and the inner "gourmet" chef inside me goes crazy. after i picked out the tomatoes, lettuce, and all the basics, i walked by the jalapenos section and decided i wanted a little spice for my tacos. i decided to pick a few different jalapenos, hoping that they will range in spiciness. 

excited with my new addition for my taco recipe, as soon as i got home i started to prep all the ingredients for the tacos. with my jalapenos being my main priority with the meal, i decided to prep those first. i carefully cleaned them all and brought out a big cutting board and began chopping them all up. i was very meticulous in the chopping, making sure that the sizes were all even. to say the least, it was very hands on.
being young and naive, i didn't think much of what i was doing and the powerful juices of jalapenos. that all changed very quickly.

it was after i was finished with the jalapenos that i went straight to the washroom to take a leak. being a male i stood up, did the usual stand-up-take-a-leak routine, shake and all, flushed, and then washed my hands. noting out of the ordinary there.

10 minutes later, though, everything changed. i was in the middle of preparing the rest of the tacos when i began to feel the worst pain i have felt in a very long time. my dick was on fire. not knowing what was going on, i began to freak out. my dick had this intense burning sensation, like it was being dipped in lava, and it kept on getting worse. at this moment i had no idea what caused the pain. i quickly began running around the house freaking out. my dad was out at work so i couldn't ask him what was going on, and my mother was mia. 

freaking out, i ran upstairs to take a shower, to see if i could wash it off. didn't work. still in immense pain i rushed to grab some ice cubes to see if it would somehow cool off the pain. nope. trying various methods to stop the burning sensation with none working, i really started to get scared. i then found a tube of polysporin in my parents bathroom and started to generously apply it to the burning region. it worked! the burning sensation was slowly drifting away. in my relaxed state, however, polysporin-covered-dick in hand, i did not realized i that i had left the door to the washroom open. just when i thought things couldn't get worse, my mom walked in.

just what a 14 year old needed.

after a very awkward conversation explaining all the polysporin and what i was doing with it, my mom burst out laughing. apparently (which i can't believe i didn't know then) the juices from the jalapenos are very strong and can cause a burning sensation where there is delicate skin. 

i haven't had a jalapeno since.

    Here is the summary: The author, a 14-year-old boy, decided to make tacos by himself and picked jalapenos from the grocery store, which caused a burning sensation in his private area after he chopped them

freaking out, i ran upstairs to take a shower, to see if i could wash it off. didn't work. still in immense pain i rushed to grab some ice cubes to see if it would somehow cool off the pain. nope. trying various methods to stop the burning sensation with none working, i really started to get scared. i then found a tube of polysporin in my parents bathroom and started to generously apply it to the burning region. it worked! the burning sensation was slowly drifting away. in my relaxed state, however, polysporin-covered-dick in hand, i did not realized i that i had left the door to the washroom open. just when i thought things couldn't get worse, my mom walked in.

just what a 14 year old needed.

after a very awkward conversation explaining all the polysporin and what i was doing with it, my mom burst out laughing. apparently (which i can't believe i didn't know then) the juices from the jalapenos are very strong and can cause a burning sensation where there is delicate skin. 

i haven't had a jalapeno since.

    Here is the summary: A 14-year-old boy decided to make tacos by himself and picked jalapenos from the grocery store, not realizing that their juices could cause a burning sensation
    


    You will be given one summary written for a news article. Your task is to rate the summary based on the following criteria:

    Evaluation Criteria:
    1. Read the news article carefully and identify the main topic and key points.
    2. Read the summary and compare it to the news article. Check if the summary covers the main topic and key points of the news article, and if it resents them in a clear and logical order.
    3. Rate the summary with 5 percentages, where each one represents how likely the summary is going to get a score from 1 to 5. For example, if you think the summary is 80% likely to get a score of 5, 10% likely to get a score of 4, 5% likely to get a score of 3, 3% likely to get a score of 2, and 1% likely to get a score of 1, you should rate the summary as 80, 10, 5, 3, 2.

    Here is the article: this happened two thursdays ago. i live in a tropical area and there is a cut off date on traveling with animals. it gets too hot and the airlines don't want to risk losing an animal in the belly of the plane.

because i had planned to fly off island for 10 days and i was leaving before the cut off date, i offered to bring the dog up with me.

traveling was fine. no issues. i get to the final destination (jfk) and pick the dog up, grab my luggage and meet my friends mother. i offer to help her with the dog and undo the crate for her so she can fit it in her car.

we get to the parking lot and i open the crate, grab the leash and had the dog over to his mother. as i start to undo the crate the dog gets out of his leash and books it.

i chase this dog for 15mins, running around cars and jumping over fences... then i realize i left my carry on, laptop and luggage right in the parking lot area. the dog is long gone by now.

i run back to the car and see all my stuff gone. only thing left was the crate. i see my friends mom running off in the distance. i look and see she put all my stuff in her car(thank god, it is nyc after all). the car wasn't locked though. i run after the mom and she says she left the keys in the car so i run back to the car, grab the dog leash and search through her purse for her keys. find them, undo the crate, put it in the car and lock it.

at this point it's probably been 30mins. i run back to the area and ask this parking lot security guy if he has seen the dog. he said he ran that way, pointing in a restricted area right there at the airport. i start running and looking back and forth for this dog.

a cop car comes flying up with his lights on. i'm thinking i'm about to get shot but the guy sees me holding the leash and asks if i'm the dog owner. i said yes, i'm responsible for it and he tells me to get in the passenger side. we start cruising around asking people if they saw the dog.

little did i know there are 5 other cop cars going around, blocking traffic and trying to locate this fucking mutt. i'm thinking this dog is going to get hit by a car or just run off and never will be seen again.

i hear on the radio, dog located at such and such area, we pull a u turn and fly off that way. both of us keeping our eyes peeled. no luck. after cruising around for 30mins and driving all over, probably causing people to miss flights or getting flights delayed i hear on the radio k-9 secured.

we drive over there and i see 4 cop cars in the middle of the road. turns out they got the dog so simply. when they spotted him they left the car doors open and just booked it after him, apparently this dog loves going on car rides so it just jumped into the car and sat in the seat.

i shook every single nypd officers hand and they said we got lucky. apparently jfk lost some big show dog a few weeks ago that worth worth a pretty penny. also some hounds got loose a while back and one got hit by a car.

one officer drove us back to her parked vehicle, i carried the mutt directly into her car to avoid another situation and closed the door right behind it. k-9 secured. shook the officers hand again and he took down some of our information for his report. 

all in all it was a hell of a day but one hell of a story to tell. i have nothing but respect for the nypd now. the dog is happy and fine now at his new home.

    Here is the summary: I brought my dog with me on a flight, but during the layover, he escaped and led me and 5 NYPD officers on a 30-minute chase through the airport

    Here is the article: obligatory this was when i was 9.

so it was summer and i live in florida, so when there was a breeze it felt like heaven.
one of these breezes started in the middle of the day and lasted like 3 hours. 

this is where the fuck-up happens.
my dad gets home from work, and we decide to close the window, but little sister wasn't strong enough, so i get sent in.

 it was stuck; the track on the sides were completely diagonal to where they're supposed to be. i hit the metal sides to try to get it back on track but it doesn't work. 

so 9 year old me decides "hey! it would be a good idea to push directly on the glass as hard as possible, right?" so i do that, and it shatters. my wrists had a deep laceration each, and you could see the tendon in my right wrist.

 emergency services arrive in 5-9 minutes, and i get some temporary gause for my wrists, and driven to er. have you ever been in the er? if not, imagine antarctica, no joke.

 so it's 30 degrees in there, and i wait literally 2 hours before anything happens, then the nurse comes in, and injects local anesthetic directly in my lacerations, and at that point i wasn't in shock anymore and my adrenaline was long gone.

 worst part is, after that, a male nurse looking pissed comes in, without saying anything, grunts, then jams a big ass tetanus shot in my arm. i had to have 7 stitches in each wrist and it took a month and a half for me to recover, had to have my right arm in a splint for that time too.

    Here is the article: this happened less than an hour ago so i am still contemplating moving planets. i've been going to a weekly circuits class for a few months, where you alternate between stations doing different exercises. 

this week with about 10 minutes to go we're throwing a ball weight (not sure what its called), between each other and squatting as we catch it. it's going fine until all of a sudden, as i catch the weight and go to squat, i hear what seems like the loudest rip i have ever heard. i look down and there is a huge hole from top to bottom of my shorts. oh and i'm also wearing pink striped boxers. 

so the others in my group usher over the woman doing the class, who tries to make me feel better about the situation, still with her microphone on... so now everyone in the room is looking at me trying not to laugh as i have to do the walk of shame, leaving early because of my ripped shorts. 

next week is gonna be fun...

    Here is the article: so it's my so's graduation on thursday, and we had left it to the last minute to book a hotel. my so has no money so she needed me to book it. so she sent me the link to the hotel's page on laterooms through whatsapp. i was at work at the time, and we were pretty swamped at the time, but i really wanted to get a load of stuff out of the way before the brazil vs germany game came on.

so with a guy on the phone, a remote connection to his computer open, the buildup to the game on, and the link open on my phone, i clicked the link which brought up a load of room options, and i booked one. put in my credit card details, hit confirm, and confirm again. email through, done. after finishing my stuff at work, i sat back and watched the game. what a game.

now this morning, i went to see my so, and said i had booked the hotel. i went onto the email to show her, and... "check in date: 08/07/14"

shit.

the link she had sent me had a 10 in it. that was my defence. i thought she had sent me the rooms for thursday, and had neglected to read the "read thoroughly" page before confirming my booking. i tried to call the hotel, but my money was gone. i had booked it at 20:45, and final check in was 23:00. i thought i had a chance of clawing something back, but no.

what's more, i had opted to surprise her by upgrading our room to  suite. so rather than the £120 for one night my so had proposed, i had opted for the room that was £310 a night. twice. at least i managed to get a room eventually.

    Here is the summary: I booked a hotel room for my daughter's graduation using a link she sent me through WhatsApp, but I accidentally booked the room for the wrong date and ended up paying twice the original price for a suite

    Here is the article: this actually took place over several days. i was working on a water sourced a/c unit last week and had to run new pvc pipe to the unit. after running the new pvc i left and let the glue cure until my co-worker could get back to run the unit a couple days later. he ran the unit and everything was fine, so he finished up for the day and left the a/c running. my boss calls me this morning and tells me i need to get over there now, the owner called and said the place was flooded. i went there as quick as i could and there is about a foot of water in 2 seperate rooms, both of which were being used to store all materials and tools. the owner lost every spare piece of dry wall he had, several pieces of plywood, and some doors, idk how much it all cost him but i would guess a couple thousand dollars. it took us 6 hours to get rid of all the water and all the bad material and afterward found out that when the water level was high enough to go into the bathrooms the water started going down the floor drains preventing the water from going any higher.  after the clean up we did some investigating and found a pvc fitting to the water sourced a/c unit that me and my boss put together wasnt glued properly and broke loose and poured out water for nearly 2 days.

    Here is the summary: The owner of a building called the boss to report a flood, and the boss called the employee who had worked on the water-sourced A/C unit, as they suspected the issue was related to the unit

    Here is the article: this didn't happen today. in fact, it happened on december 10th, 2015.  
i got a text from a number i did not recognize. it looked like an advertisement from some bot, and i was worried that some advertisement company had my number or something. so i decided to be assertive, and cursed at the sender, warning them that if they text my again i would call the police for harassment. but the thing is, they did text me back, and it turned out to be my friend's mother who for some reason texted me about this app she had. after apologizing and claiming that people have been   spamming my phone as an excuse (that was a total lie by the way), we never spoke about it again.

    Here is the article: this was last night, but i'm now realizing my fuck up.

so my roommate and i go to our favorite local mexican restaurant for some margaritas. now we do this very often but this time was different. the special is $4 18 oz. texas margaritas, and damn if these are the strongest, cheapest margaritas in town. so my girlfriend drops us off there and says she will be back to pick us up in an hour, well one hour turns to two, we're both hammered, she's still watching the series finale of true blood, we decide to huff it home ( it's only about a mile and a half from our house ). 

so we just get to the front of our neighborhood and i spot a guy walking his little weiner dog, i'm interested and go up to pet the little guy. he loves it, i love him and whatever. so then as we are about to turn on to our street i spot a cat just sitting in a driveway. 

now at this point i am very used to cats being skittish, so i was completely expecting that as i approach this cat, it will in turn run away. 

so i approach the cat, and it doesn't move. i stopped, drunk and perplexed as to why it was being so calm. so i then kneel down next to it and it rolls over as if to say, "look at me, i'm so pretty". at this point i'm overly excited and i pick the cat up and bring it over to my roommate. we both then confide in each other that we should bring the cat home. 

we play with it all night, feed it some ham, take pictures with it, the whole deal. 

well i start to realize my fuck up today, as in what if this is someone else's cat? what if this cat belongs to a family with child who dearly loves this cat? so i have always heard that cats are pretty smart, and always find their way home. so i figured, hey it's right down the street from where i took it from, it will just head home, right? 

wrong, this cat will not leave. i fed the cat and then let it out when it woke me at 3 am this morning, hoping it would find its way home. well i woke up at 9 to a text from my roommate saying he let cat in because it was just sitting by our door. 

so what am i supposed to do now? bring the cat to the house and say, "hey i found a cat, is it yours?" , post signs, hope they post signs. it has no collar, and i just brought it to petland to check for a microchip, none.

    Here is the summary: Last night, you and your roommate drank margaritas at a local Mexican restaurant and ended up bringing a stray cat home, not realizing it might belong to someone else

    Here is the article: so, like most fuck ups, and like the only other fuck up i posted, this happened years ago, but i'll give a bit of back story as to what inspired me to write this. i was scrolling through /r/tifu and saw one that mentioned friday the 13th, and i have quiet the story for a friday the 13th experience of my own.               

so it was june 13th of 2008, a friday (obviously). i was at my dad's house, it was starting to get dark but not too dark to see outside. so i'm doing my last chore before him and i leave for my hockey practice that night, and the chore was to take out the trash. see, taking out the trash at my dad's house means to put the trash bag into a large metal barrel out by the garage (which is roughly 100 yard away, completely detached) and set it on fire. not environmentally safe at all, but saved money in terms of getting our garbage picked up by waste management. so, i do this every other day and everything's going well, just like any other day. today's a little windy, but i put a metal lid over the barrel for extra safety precautions anyway, so it's all good. i've done it 100+ times, what's the worse that could happen? i'm sure any reader could see where this is going already. fast forward an hour: i have all my pads and jersey on, and we're walking out to the car as we see lights flicker in the hallway (the garage and house still share very long electrical lines and underground circuits), so we look over and see a very large plume of black smoke. my dad immediately calls 911, and it gets written off as an electrical fire. he doesn't blame me for it, he's the one who asked me to do it too, but i still feel bad 6 years later.                                 

6 months later we had a fully built, larger, 90% metal garage built in place of the old one after we tore the remains of it down. all in all, a shitty situation, but we got everything replaced and a larger garage than before.

    Here is the summary: On June 13th, 2008, the author was tasked with taking out the trash at their dad's house, which involved setting a metal barrel filled with trash on fire, but things went horribly wrong when a large plume of black smoke appeared an hour later, causing an electrical fire

    Here is the article: i take the train to the city to go to work.  my wife was running late to pick me up from the station so i sat at a bench as i wait for her.  several minutes later, a guy who looked like he's been walking for a while arrived at the station and sat next to me.

he struck up a conversation and told me how he doesn't have any money for fare back home and asked if i could help him out.  he told me how he just started a job in the area and that he has no money until his first paycheck and doesn't know how he'll be able to get there before that.

i felt bad for the guy and wanted to help out but i don't really have much money myself. not to mention that i don't really carry cash on me. 

so i'm not the type of person who pays attention to details much.  i remember my monthly train pass coming in the mail earlier this week and for some reason that made me think that it must be august next week already.  i took my july monthly pass card out of my bag and gave it to him.  i figured i'll just pay for my fare today and start using my august pass next week.

today, i looked at the calendar and what do you know? it's actually still a full week before august.  i just had to use my last remaining money to buy a week's worth of train tickets and now only have less than $15 to spend for the next week.  oh well, i just hope that guy puts it to good use and gets to keep his new job for a while haha.

gave my july monthly train pass to a guy that needed help thinking it had a few days use left.  turns out i can't use my august pass for another full week and had to buy a week's worth of tickets.  now even more broke for next week.

    Here is the article: so this happened yesterday rather than today.

i got home from work yesterday and my dog was super energetic so i decided it would be a good idea to go to a field local to me and throw frisbee and let him run around a bit.

the field near my house is fairly open and large but its surrounded by trees with a few paths that sometimes people go for walks on. after a few throws, my dogs energy levels just aren't going down so i figure i'm just gonna belt this frisbee as far as i can.

here's the fuck-up: as soon as i cocked back my arm and threw the frisbee with the power of zeus himself, i noticed a family coming out of the trees. now my dog is bolting across the field faster than i've ever seen him run, and i mean he is gunning it to the point where he's actually creating a dust trail behind him. this family are now further into the field. i see my dog looking back to where the frisbee is coming down. i spot the child. i can see what's going to happen. my dog lunges himself off the ground towards the frisbee and as he's coming down he literally decimates this small child with his body and goes tumbling.

all i hear is an angry father yelling "hey fuckwit" so in panic i turn and start sprinting away quickly followed by my dog who has no idea what he's just done and thinks we're going for a run.

 

edit: i have a pitbull-boxer mix that weighs 68 pounds

    Here is the summary: The author threw a frisbee in a field near their house, but their dog, a pitbull-boxer mix, lunged at a small child who was walking with their family, causing the child to be decimated by the dog's body and sending the author and the dog running away in panic

    Here is the article: so this happened yesterday rather than today.

i got home from work yesterday and my dog was super energetic so i decided it would be a good idea to go to a field local to me and throw frisbee and let him run around a bit.

the field near my house is fairly open and large but its surrounded by trees with a few paths that sometimes people go for walks on. after a few throws, my dogs energy levels just aren't going down so i figure i'm just gonna belt this frisbee as far as i can.

here's the fuck-up: as soon as i cocked back my arm and threw the frisbee with the power of zeus himself, i noticed a family coming out of the trees. now my dog is bolting across the field faster than i've ever seen him run, and i mean he is gunning it to the point where he's actually creating a dust trail behind him. this family are now further into the field. i see my dog looking back to where the frisbee is coming down. i spot the child. i can see what's going to happen. my dog lunges himself off the ground towards the frisbee and as he's coming down he literally decimates this small child with his body and goes tumbling.

all i hear is an angry father yelling "hey fuckwit" so in panic i turn and start sprinting away quickly followed by my dog who has no idea what he's just done and thinks we're going for a run.

 

edit: i have a pitbull-boxer mix that weighs 68 pounds

    Here is the summary: I threw a frisbee with my dog in a field near my house, but unintentionally knocked over a small child with my dog's body while he was chasing the frisbee, causing the child's father to yell at me

    Here is the article: this happened either in the first or second week of school last semester. i had just gotten back from summer vacation and was excited to see all my college friends again, so naturally i went on about a week-long bender of getting piss drunk every night. following a long night at the bars i somehow made it back to my dorm and promptly passed out on the futon. now i should mention that i have an old george foreman grill that i use from time to time. it's a small dorm room so i have to keep it on the floor against the wall. so there i am sleeping soundly for a couple of hours before i woke up (still heavily under the influence) and had to use the restroom. i thought that i got up, walked out the door, down the hall, and into the bathroom to hose down the porcelain. however, as you might have guessed, that is not what happened. apparently, i got up, opened the electric grill, and relieved myself all over poor george as well as my wall. i don't have a roommate to confirm that is exactly what happened, but i quickly figured it out the next morning when i wanted to grill some breakfast sausage. 

in my defense the grill looks a lot like a toilet seat when it is closed.

    Here is the summary: After a week-long bender of heavy drinking, the author woke up in their dorm room to use the restroom, but instead of making it to the bathroom, they relieved themselves all over their George Foreman grill and the wall

    Here is the article: i share an office with four other people on a university campus. we each have our own desktop computer, owned by the college, and i use mine for teaching and working on my doctoral dissertation. today, as i was quietly working alone in my office, the it graduate assistant asked to come in and look at some of the computers. oddly, he only ended up going onto my computer for about fifteen seconds and then left. i asked if something was wrong, or if i could help somehow, and he said he was just checking up on all the computers in the department. about five minutes later i heard someone knock on the door again, and the same grad student is back with two police officers. they point to the computer i use and ask if it's mine. i respond saying it's university property, but that i've never seen anyone besides me use it. i add that there's a chance someone else may have used it before, since it's a shared office and i'm not in the room 24/7. they attempt to make small talk and take away the computer, maintaining that they can't tell me anything about what's happening.

now that they're gone, i'm trying to recall anything out of the ordinary that may give me a clue as to what's going on. i rarely download anything (and nothing illegal, not even music), and all my files are saved on an external hard drive. the only bizarre moment i can think of was about a month or two ago on another computer in the same building (in the classroom where i teach a class). i use this computer twice a week to show material to my class, much of which is saved under bookmarks in my google chrome account. one day while teaching, i noticed all my bookmarks were in place, but i was logged in under someone else's name. later, i looked up the name and found a recent article about someone with the name moniker who was arrested for possession of narcotics here in town. besides that, i'm pretty clueless as to what could have caused the police department to get involved. updates if anything progresses, all inquiries are welcome.

my father told me not to run and not to go in slippers, i told him nothing is going to happen to me if i go in slippers.

so i continue walking to the ice cream shop even though my slipper is ripped, and when i arrive, the dog is fucking standing outside. 
there was no way i was going to get near it, i walked back home, with no ice cream, a ripped slipper, and a bloody knee. oh, and i missed the first 10 minutes of the match.

    Here is the article: edit: thank you so much to whoever gilded this. wow, this really blew up. 

this happened during this week, but i hadn't been able to post it on here until now.

my bedside table has a lamp, my phone, a full can of drink, and a bag of crisps on it. the lamp has a lead which runs down to the floor and is plugged into a 4 point extention plug which i also use to charge my laptop, phone, and whatever else needs power.

so i'm laying in bed, my mind fully on a game i'm playing on my laptop when my phone rings. normally, this wouldn't be a big deal, but because i'm so immersed in my game, i reach over without looking and promptly knock the lamp over, which in turn knocks everything else on the table over and sends the can of drink on a suicide run down the side of my bed.

after much swearing and hurridly picking up my phone and the lamp, it suddenly occurs to me that coca cola and electricity might not be the best combination in the world, and i instinctively reach down to pull the lead out.

unfortunately, despite having been told in childhood not to play with fire, run with scissors, talk to strangers, or indeed put my fingers near a live electrical socket. in the brief panic, all that common sense departs my brain, and i'm left grabbing down the side of the bed, frantically pulling at plugs that are dripping with sugary soda

it's roughly 3 or 4 seconds later when the most intense stinging pain i've ever felt in my life shoots through my hand, and by some miracle i jerk my hand back as the entire plug makes a popping noise and starts to smell of charred plastic and burned fingertips.

it's within those first few moments, somewhere between the thoughts of "oh my god, i'm still alive" and "damn, i hope my laptop charger is ok" that a strange gurgling sound eminates from the depths of hell known as my stomach.

the human race has evolved for millennia to have a fight or flight instinct, and when faced with a massive scare, is well known for dropping it's... uh...baggage at the first oppertunity.

so it is with great horror i realise, as i lay there in my nice comfortable bed, that my body has decided that now, of all times, would be the perfect moment to let rip with a stream of hot mushy diarrhea.

gee, thanks anus, you really shouldn't have.

as i struggle to my feet, i feel it emerging, like a beast from a pit, bursting it's way into this world.

i make it to my knees, and look around, there's no way i'm gonna get to the bathroom in time, and having to navigate the bedroom, the hall way, and a small set of stairs to the toilet seems a challange akin to climbing mount everest.

there's only one thing i can do. i grab the bag of crisps and slam it against my erupting anus.

but of course, the bag is far too small, and not even close to being properly positioned, and the horrific gush of shit swiftly overwhelms it like a flood.

there has to be another way, i think, briefly considering my clothing, my bed sheets, or a pillowcase... yes! thank you pillowcase, i knew you would come in handy one day!

the pillowcase, in it's delicate cream and blue coloring quickly joins the crisp packet, it won't hold long, but it stems the flow just long enough for me to make my escape.

i run to the bathroom with the speed of the flash...if the flash was covered in his own poop... hurling myself towards the toilet at near light speed.

30 minutes later i emerge, in shock, but no longer spraying shit like a burst sewer pipe

i survey the damage.

there's shit on my bed, down my legs, up my arms, across the floor, infact there's probably more areas of my bedroom covered with my own shit than i ever thought possible.

i begin the long, slow, and disgusting job of clearing up, and think to myself, at least one thing came out of this. i can finally post something on tifu

oh, and i found out the phone call was just a marketing call after all that... fuck my life.

    Here is the summary: The author's bedside table had a lamp, phone, full can of drink, and bag of crisps on it, and when they knocked over the lamp, everything else fell over and the author accidentally grabbed the live electrical socket, causing a painful shock and a stream of hot mushy diarrhea

i begin the long, slow, and disgusting job of clearing up, and think to myself, at least one thing came out of this. i can finally post something on tifu

oh, and i found out the phone call was just a marketing call after all that... fuck my life.

    Here is the summary: The author's bedside table had a lamp, phone, full can of drink, and a bag of crisps on it, but things quickly went downhill when the author knocked over the lamp while answering a phone call, causing a chain reaction of events that ended with the author experiencing a massive diarrhea attack and covering their bedroom in feces

    Here is the article: a bit of background first, so i'm a middle school student who takes all honors courses and is generally a bookworm straight-a student. my friend on the other hand, lets call him john, is a pretty normal person who is average in just about everything. he also has adhd, and needs to take pills to make him calmer. 

a few days ago john forgot to take his medication,  and is being super annoying. like next level annoying all throughout the periods i have with him. we suddenly get to 4th period and after basically failing an extremely hard spanish exam i decide to chill out in a free period. midway through the period i get up to get some chips from the vending machine. john then decides to put thumbtacks under my seat, and when i come back to sit down he pull the chair out from under me. i landed on the hard. i then being pissed as fuck decide to punch him and walk out of the classroom. no one is in the room to witness this, but a random teacher saw me punch him and walk out. 

fast forward to the next day, i get called up the the vice principal's office and they tell me i have detention for this. the best part is that john never got any punishment, and even after explaining what happened they still don't give him a punishment. now i'm stuck here in detention because i let my anger get the best of me, while my ex-friend get off scot-free. 

 

btw, this is my first reddit post! :d

    Here is the article: my wife enjoys drinking tea throughout her workday.  if i'm not working i brew her a cup when we get up while the kids are getting ready.  if i'm coming off nights i brew the tea when i get home at 7am.  that's what happened yesterday.  i got home at 7am, brewed the tea, and poured it into her double walled, stainless steel travel mug.  the thing is a beast, locks in the heat, and doesn't leak a drop.  after brewing the tea, i go upstairs, and promptly pass out.

i woke up at 12:30 in the morning with a lovely email from my wife.  

~~~~~~~~~
"
dear husband:
 
you have no idea how much i appreciate you and when you make me tea. i look forward to my warm cup when i sit down at my desk. and it is not sarcastic.
 
so imagine my surprise when i reach into my michael kors purse and the cup is warm but the cup is empty?  hmmm….oh wait there it is….my gloves soaked up a lot. great! no biggie. oh and so did my purple danier leather wallet and my calvin klein wallet. no problem….it will dry. it is just nice smelling water. oh wait, what this lying in a pool of tea…my … no ….no…no….my blackberry.
 
congratulations! we are going to get a phone now because my baby has tried to turn back on after being dried up and just can’t do it. at the most i get is a white screen when it manages to power up or just the red blinking light before it powers down.
 
it is shaping up to be a lovely day.
 
hope you get a good rest"

i shower quickly and pick her up at work.  we go down to our cellular provider and decide that we are both going to upgrade to the iphone 6 (no hate please).  we set up our contracts, get our shiny new phones and we go back to my wife's office where i attempt to sync her work email and work calender to her iphone.  first the email, which took some work but we managed to get it t work.  and then i try a work around to sync the microsoft outlook calender to the phone through google.  i can't seem to get the calender to work, so we leave it and go home.

we get home and my wife goes to check a work email ... but it's empty, nothing is populating.  she logs onto the web api and it's the same, every folder, ever mail is gone.  poof.  she went from 0 - 60 in no time flat.

you see, my wife doesn't like change.  she was using a blackberry bold from 5, 6 years ago.  and while it's not much of a smart phone, it did the job perfectly for her.  the change to the iphone was overwhelming, loosing all of her work emails, that was beyond devastating.  she left, very upset, to go for a drive.

in the meantime, i found the emails which gmail had taken via pop3 (yep, that was me too).  they were fine, but the provider for her work email doesn't facilitate incoming pop3 / imap, so they're effectively stuck on an account she will never use.

she came back, copies are saved at work.  iphone slowly starting to become alright.

    Here is the summary: My wife and I went to the cellular provider to upgrade our phones, but the transition from her Blackberry to the iPhone was not smooth, as she lost all her work emails and had to deal with the change

    Here is the article: this actually happened today. using a throwaway. 

it began as any ordinary thursday night. i was eating dinner with a few of my hall mates in the dining hall across the street from our dorm. when we finished, my roommate and i went to the minimart attached to the dining hall to buy some snacks before we headed back. when you leave the minimart, you can either stay on the sidewalk, or you can just walk down the hill and step over the short fence and back onto the sidewalk, which is usually the faster option.  at this point i have an idea. i tell my roommate to wait as i put the sour patch kids i just bought into my coat pocket and prepare my body. my roommate immediately catches on to what i am planning and calls out to the other three friends with whom we ate, who are about to walk in the door. “you guys, asphaltpenguin is doing parkour!” (this is a running joke between a few of us). they turn and look just in time to see my fuck up from beginning to end. i begin to run down the hill at considerable speed and leap over the fence. this is when i fucked up. when i landed, i still had a considerable amount of horizontal velocity. unfortunately, i landed on both my feet and couldn’t move them quick enough to keep them under my body, so i began to fly forward. i put out both my hands to break my fall, and end up sliding on my stomach like a penguin for about three feet until i was lying in the middle of the street. somehow i had the instinct to keep my knees, arms, and head up for the duration of the slide to avoid any scraping. my hands, however, were not so lucky. when i used them to break my fall i ended up scraping a good bit of skin off of my palms. [this is what they look like now.](http://i.imgur.com/4il7jiy.jpg) also i bumped my knee a little bit, but it’s ok. in hindsight, it could have ended a lot worse. we all had a good laugh about it. it was quite the spectacle.

    Here is the article: i'm new to reddit so excuse me if my grammar and formatting are horrible. let me introduce myself, i am a decent high school student in australia, new south wales. i've gotten suspended a few weeks before this incident and my school has this program where if you get suspended or behave really poorly you get a card. a card that has columns and rows for 5 days. the card is handed to your teacher at the beginning of each period or lesson and at the end she marks it, if you do well you get an a if you do decent you get a b. you get the point. 

ok, so this fuck up happened today (unlike some fuck ups). i was absent the day that the test was held. i was notified by my friends that the teacher has said the next time we have pe, you are doing the test. skip to the day the test happened. pe was on, it was 4th period. everyone changes and goes out to play basketball. great! they play my favourite sport as soon as i have to do a test. i decided to rush the test like an idiot. i didn't study nor prepare for this test. i even had really good notes but i was just in that ceebs mood throughout the week. so i come along the part where you have to label the name of the muscles on a skeletal image. i knew most but i just wanted to get better marks. i decided to hop on my phone, turn on mobile data and hop on to google thinking my test is done as easy! the teacher couldn't see as she was busy being a referee for the basketball game. i skimmed through the sheet like a paper plane gliding across the room. i found an image with all labels and i only needed one more. like an idiot that loves basketball so much and just wants to play it(me) i just write down fiburalis longus and it looked different to the other labels i written down. for example clavicle and sternum. i hand it in to the teacher and she said "woah! that was quite fast!" i responded with the usual yeah i guessed most of it. i was thinking to myself yesss! i get to play basketball! i played and have heaps of fun until she calls me up and asked me about the thing i labled on the skeletal image. my smile soon turned upside down into a frown as i realised.... i fucked up. she knew i cheated... she knows.. she knows. that kept going on and on my mind. she asked me how i got that answer and i said i dont know as i literally had no excuse until i admitted i used mr.google. she said if there are others i cheated on. i lied and said no that is all. so she asks me a random question about the name of the muscle somewhere near the body(i forgot okay? don't judge me, im stressed) i try and guess but i got it wrong and double busted me! for lying and for cheating. she says "i'm really disappointed "throwawaycumstain" i thought you could do better than this, you are a good student in my class" as i saw her face filled with disappointment. she writes a d on my card and wrote behaved well but cheated on the test. oh and by the way my parents are meant to sign the card to show that they've read my ratings. i am completely shitting myself right now, really nervous too. i found myself praying to the lord it wouldn't go on my record and my parents won't know. i almost thought i became a christian lmao. i've come with a brilliant excuse of not showing my parents the card and just saying to the deputy that i've lost it so i need to start over again as i lost it. im scared to bits and fucking pieces right now. i don't want it going on my report as it is truly embarassing and i don't want my parents to know. i truly, truly fucked up today. thanks for listening to my story reddit.

    Here is the article: three of my best friends in college and i decided that we’d spend our spring break camping/backpacking in colorado during the snowiest part of the year, march. we found a really cool cabin called piney guard station, located near wolcott, and rented it for a few days starting last sunday. it’s a cabin that was used by park rangers back in the 30s, and was recently remodeled. super cool spot. [here's a pic of the place.](http://i.imgur.com/qhx1jn3.jpg) the road to get to it is an unpaved 10 mile path off of the nearest highway. depending on the weather, you can drive up the path until it gets too snowy/muddy, and then hike the rest of the way.

day 1: sunday, march 13

7:00am 

we head out from the place we’re staying to the campsite.

10:00am

we arrive at the start of the unpaved road in our 4x4 expedition. it hasn’t snowed in weeks (weather’s been odd for colorado this year apparently), so we figure we might be able to drive the entire way. however, after a few miles, some snow starts to accumulate (not surprising with the elevation change). one of my buddies has never experienced what a 4x4 can handle in snow, and i have, and i’m feeling 100% confident. he’s lowkey worried and consistently says “are you sure we won’t get stuck?” i laugh and say “dan, this is easy, i’ve driven through much worse”. the snow was packed down real nice and we were cruising in 2 wheel drive the entire time. to be honest, we were just fine at this point. the roads were easy. 

after about 6 miles, the road opened up quite a bit and there was a gravel patch to park at. it wasn’t totally obvious that this is intended to be a parking lot during the winter months, and i wanted to keep pressing on. meanwhile, dan gets out of the truck and says “i don’t like this man, we can walk 3 miles, let’s just park”. well, we have 40 pound backpacks and 30 pound sleds to carry, and if we can drive the rest of the way, i wasn’t going to walk that much. besides, there were fresh tire tracks that we figured we could drive on. the two other guys agreed with me, and the worried friend got out of the truck and watched as we threw it into 4 low and began to trek through the snow.  within just a foot, the ground went from gravel to packed down snow to 2 feet of snow, and [we immediately sank through.](http://i.imgur.com/10dndlv.jpg)
dan looks at me with a “i told you so” look, and i laugh. “you were right, man. i’m sorry. let’s get us out and park and we’ll walk”. i grab the shovels and some door mats and we all get to work.
turns out, the truck was very high centered and the snow was incredibly slushy. we dug and dug for hours, and couldn’t get out. fortunately, i had cell service in the car, and i called aaa and they said they couldn’t get any services to come out to us, and all of the park rangers/wildlife services were closed (it was a sunday). we decide we’d abandon the car and go hike the 3 miles to the cabin and get warm and try again tomorrow, figuring the rangers would help. we arrived at the cabin and knocked out very quickly (16 hour drive + very little sleep + hiking 70 lbs of stuff + shoveling for hours).

&nbsp;

day 2: monday, march 14th 

8:00am.

we woke up and headed back to the truck. it’s approximately a 2-3 hour hike between the truck and the cabin, and it’s very exhausting. meanwhile, an unexpected blizzard (it was supposed to be clear the entire vacation) happened to roll in overnight, and snow started to really accumulate. the winds began to pick up, but we were determined.


12:00pm. 

we arrive at the truck. we continued to shovel, but the snow turned to ice overnight. our axels were both stuck and most of the frame was too. 

i called the rangers and they said it was not at all part of their service and refused to help. all nearby tow companies didn’t have the balls to try to drive to us and denied us too. all we needed was a slight pull, just a foot, not even, and we’d be free. the tow companies kept directing us to another tow company to try to call, promising they’d help, and it just became a phone tag game. we began to get worried, thinking no one would ever want to bother to get us unstuck. we didn’t want to pay thousands for a search and rescue just because we couldn’t get a simple one foot pull. plus, we were running low on supplies. it was getting dark, so we had no choice but to head back to the cabin for the night.

&nbsp;

day 3, tuesday, march 15th 

about 7:00am

morale was low. supplies were running low. energy was increasingly low. we had to get out today, or things would start to get dangerous rather quickly. a second blizzard rolled in, and it was strong. white out conditions. 40 mile per hour winds and enough snow to cover up the trail to the point where it was hard to follow back to the truck. you couldn’t see 15 feet in front of you.

11:15am

somehow, we made it back to the truck. i really don’t know how, to be honest. it took a lot longer to get to the truck, and my phone battery was running low.  i called some more and started to say that our lives are on the line and we are desperate for a tow asap. one tow company laughed and said “didn’t you call yesterday? the answer’s still no, pal”. we started to call tow companies hours away, knowing that it would cost at minimum $250 an hour, but we didn’t care. we were fed up. we needed out. even the sheriff’s department wasn’t sure what to do. they claimed they’ve never had their contracted tow companies refuse to come out to get people, and were up in arms. told us they’d call back.
 
12:00pm

anxiety is skyrocketing. no call from the sheriff. no tow company is willing to get us. 

2:00pm

my phone starts ringing. “hello?” “hey, my name’s thomas and i hear you’re stuck? i think i might be able to get you”. *trying to hide my excitement so as not to scare him away* “really?! we could really use your help, man. it’s tough out here and we’re running low on supplies”. “hey, no worries man. let me fill up my tank and i’ll be as soon as i can”. 

2:15pm

my phone rings again. “hello?” “hey, i’m with the sherriff’s department and i want to help you guys out. even if we can’t pull you out, i can at least pick you boys up and bring you to safety.” “we got someone coming up to get us, but you’re more than welcome to come just in case”. “i’d love to, this sounds like a great story and i want to be a part of it”. 

3:00pm

the blizzard is just barely loosening up, and we can see out on the horizon this huge, badass, jacked up electric blue jeep cherokee followed by a police suv. they both pull up to us. the guy comes out of the jeep and he looks like he’s our age. turns out, he was still in high school. super cool kid. great sense of humor and has his head on straight.  he had absolutely no trouble getting up to us and laughed and said that this’ll be the easiest and most fun $500 he’s ever made. the deputy comes out of his squad car and was an absolute character. “not gonna lie, if it wasn’t for this jeep i don’t think i could’ve made it up this far!” he says, as he shakes our hands. i’ve never met a more lively and funny cop. loves his job and loved just being there to help us. 

sure enough, with a simple pull, we were able to get unstuck. we pay the kid the $500 and we head back out, in a convoy fashion. let me tell you, it was quite a sight. us in front, a huge jeep behind us, and the deputy in hot pursuit. [here's a pic of the two vehicles.](http://i.imgur.com/gwgoupm.jpg) not only that, we didn’t have to worry about freezing in the car overnight or eating each other or something. it was a time of great excitement. we headed back to boulder and spent a few days there just enjoying leisure hikes in the rockies/estes park/etc. it was beautiful.

&nbsp;

colorado was awesome. convinced me that i want to live here in a few years. the people we met were so neat. the views were incredible. lessons were learned, and i wouldn’t take back this last week for anything. my buddy forgave me that day (he’ a great guy) and we’re all closer than ever before. thanks for listening to our story.


i also don’t know how the kid with the jeep heard about us. we still don’t know how he found out about us, or if he’s contracted through a tow service, or what. it was a miracle in every sense of the word.

    Here is the article: three of my best friends in college and i decided that we’d spend our spring break camping/backpacking in colorado during the snowiest part of the year, march. we found a really cool cabin called piney guard station, located near wolcott, and rented it for a few days starting last sunday. it’s a cabin that was used by park rangers back in the 30s, and was recently remodeled. super cool spot. [here's a pic of the place.](http://i.imgur.com/qhx1jn3.jpg) the road to get to it is an unpaved 10 mile path off of the nearest highway. depending on the weather, you can drive up the path until it gets too snowy/muddy, and then hike the rest of the way.

    Here is the article: a rare tifu that actually happened today. well, within the last 24 hours at least.

part of my job includes reading meters so the company can send bills to people.  
to help with reading these meters, we are given a small 8 inch tablet and an electric golf cart to drive around neighborhoods.

i was finished with one area and was loading the cart onto its trailer. i needed both of my hands for a moment, so i placed the tablet on the seat of the cart.

i finished up and hopped into the truck to travel to the next neighborhood. to a quick turn onto a highway and, checking that there was no other vehicles around, reached for my tablet to glance at the address on the list.

where's the tablet? it didn't fall to the floorboard again did it?  
no it didn't.  
it was still on the cart.  
shit.

another look around to make sure there's no oncoming traffic. nope, all clear. one quick u-turn and i'm headed back.

hope i can find it. hope it's not too damaged.  
...
and in the 20 seconds it takes to get back to the neighborhood entrance, 4 cars pass me going in the other direction.  
and there's the tablet.  
in the lane of traffic.  
completely crushed and broken.
with several day's worth of readings that had not been uploaded to the company's database yet.

fuck.  
i just wanted a normal week. one where i finished on time and didn't have to work overtime. i was on track to be on time too.  
in less than a minute, my weekend disappears and i'll be working instead of visiting family.

boss was not too pleased either.

    Here is the article: background: 2005 bmw 745i (e65) with a power trunk.

so as many may know the e65 is home to quite a lot of issues. some computer issue with mine made the battery drain if left for a while so after work today the battery was dead and i asked a coworker for a jump.

so my coworker positions his car next to mine, and i hit the button to open the trunk to get jumper cables… then nothing happens. then i remembered that it won't open without battery power (it can close by hand though) and the jumpers were at the back, unrechable via the ski hole behind the rear armrest. my coworker, unfortunately, didn't carry any jumper cables…

i'm home now, after half an hour in the parking garage, because i gave road assistance a call and they jumped my car so i can open the trunk to get the jumpers out, and also, of course, drive home as my work is in a suburb and not the city i live in.

    Here is the summary: After a frustrating experience with a dead battery and a non-opening trunk, I was able to get my 2005 BMW 745i (E65) started again with the help of road assistance and was able to retrieve the jumpers from the trunk to continue my journey home

    Here is the article: hello reddit. boy, do i have a story for you. so, i was home alone just chillin' on the net when my mom and grandma got home from their weekly grocery shopping trip. i went outside to see if they needed help with carrying in the groceries. they were both in awe of a group of baby quails chilling by our basement door. i looked at them and giggled a little bit. i told my mom to make sure when she goes inside not to let any of them in. she ignored my warning, and turned the knob to go inside. of course, a quail got in. we all got into panic mode, and knew we were in for a ride. especially considering this is probably the messiest room you've ever seen.

so, our next half an hour was spent trying to work together to get the quail out.  we tried soft-talking to it, we tried imitating chirping sounds, heck! we even tried luring him out by playing mother quail calls on my grandma's laptop. nothing worked. eventually, my grandma handed my mom a flashlight, and she spotted him. i went to get a drink of water, and when i came back, my mom had the quail in her hands. we all let go a sigh of relief, and my mom went to the door.

she opened the door to let it out, and my grandma went along. i opened the door a teensy bit to see him off. i couldn't see, so i opened the door a bit more. next thing i know, 4-6 other baby quails charge into the door at full speed, leaving me jumping up and down in the air terrified hoping they won't hurt me. i didn't pay attention to the fact that i was jumping on my grandma's laptop that whole time, so i hope it's okay.

my mom missed the action, but my grandma and i could've sworn we saw at least 4-6 quails get inside. half an hour later, i go back downstairs to check, and my mom and grandma have caught four quails. i personally think that i saw at least five come inside, but then again, in the heat of the moment, i could've seen double.

we've given up now, and we hope we caught them all. my grandma and mom have gone out now to resume their shopping, and will continue to look again when they get back. if we find another quail, i'll get back to you guys, but otherwise, it'll forever be a mystery. so, if you can't already tell, tifu'ed severely.

 

(ps: hellfreezer, if you're reading this, you already have my permission to use this story in your video. :)

    Here is the article: hello reddit. boy, do i have a story for you. so, i was home alone just chillin' on the net when my mom and grandma got home from their weekly grocery shopping trip. i went outside to see if they needed help with carrying in the groceries. they were both in awe of a group of baby quails chilling by our basement door. i looked at them and giggled a little bit. i told my mom to make sure when she goes inside not to let any of them in. she ignored my warning, and turned the knob to go inside. of course, a quail got in. we all got into panic mode, and knew we were in for a ride. especially considering this is probably the messiest room you've ever seen.

so, our next half an hour was spent trying to work together to get the quail out.  we tried soft-talking to it, we tried imitating chirping sounds, heck! we even tried luring him out by playing mother quail calls on my grandma's laptop. nothing worked. eventually, my grandma handed my mom a flashlight, and she spotted him. i went to get a drink of water, and when i came back, my mom had the quail in her hands. we all let go a sigh of relief, and my mom went to the door.

she opened the door to let it out, and my grandma went along. i opened the door a teensy bit to see him off. i couldn't see, so i opened the door a bit more. next thing i know, 4-6 other baby quails charge into the door at full speed, leaving me jumping up and down in the air terrified hoping they won't hurt me. i didn't pay attention to the fact that i was jumping on my grandma's laptop that whole time, so i hope it's okay.

my mom missed the action, but my grandma and i could've sworn we saw at least 4-6 quails get inside. half an hour later, i go back downstairs to check, and my mom and grandma have caught four quails. i personally think that i saw at least five come inside, but then again, in the heat of the moment, i could've seen double.

we've given up now, and we hope we caught them all. my grandma and mom have gone out now to resume their shopping, and will continue to look again when they get back. if we find another quail, i'll get back to you guys, but otherwise, it'll forever be a mystery. so, if you can't already tell, tifu'ed severely.

    Here is the article: this being my first post here (or on reddit ever actually) i will first disclose that this didn't happen today, but instead a few years ago while i was in college.

to set the scene. i am a dude and i live in america. in college i took an advertising class. in said class, the professor did something every week he called "hot seat". he would pick 6 - 8 students (from the class of about 150 * the size is important because the class was so large, nobody really knew anyone else in the class) and he they would come down and answer 10 questions about the lectures from that week. for each correct answer the entire class got a free extra credit point. also note that my professor had at the beginning of the semester given a short lecture about cheating in his class.

now on to the story.

for several weeks in a row, i had watched people go up to answer the questions and just plainly fail. it was quite frustrating because these questions were fairly easy and these were free points that everyone could get. this particular week, he put the names up on the overhead and nobody came down to answer the questions. if nobody came down, we didn't get to participate and didn't get any points. i, in my brilliance, decided to go down and answer questions anyway.

i get down to the table and nobody else joins me. after a minute or two, the professor starts the lecture. "well, it looks like we have a lone ranger here. what's your name?" at this point, i started to panic; i hadn't looked at the names ahead of time to pick one out that i would be using. i quickly glanced up at the overhead and saw a last name that sounded relatively plausible. "henderson", i said as i pointed up to the name. the professor turns around and reads off the name, "esta henderson". immediately i hung my head ready for him to call me out. however, he continued and asked me all the questions. meanwhile the two ta's (teaching assistants) for the class were glaring at me from the corner of the room and whispering to each other.

at the end of the game, one of the ta's came up to talk about something and the professor went back to the other ta. as i sat there i watched them talking and then quickly glancing over at me. when the first ta was done speaking, the professor came back up and made an announcement, "guys, we are not quite done with hot seat." immediately i knew my cover was blown. "we can all get the points plus an extra one if he can answer this question correctly" the professor says. "what is your name?"

at this point sweat was beading on my face. i had never cheated before and i was 90% sure i was going to be kicked from the course. i wiped my face and quietly stammered, "esta henderson." the professor smiled slightly, "can i see your id?" he asked. "i forgot it at home this morning", i lied. he then turned towards the class and said, "well, funny thing is that now i can go to facebook and look up your name, and esta henderson is in fact a woman." that is when everyone in the class starts bursting into laughter. amid the laughter one girl (my saving angel) raised her hand and the professor called on her. "my friend took this class last semester, and her name is up on the overhead. i think you have the wrong class roster." the professor looked down at the roster and looked it over for a moment. then he said, "it looks as though you are correct. well guys, judgement_conflux/esta rocked the house today. you can keep the points."

    Here is the summary: You, as a student in an advertising class, impulsively decided to answer questions during the "hot seat" segment despite not being one of the selected students, and ended up lying about your name and gender to avoid being caught

    Here is the article: it's getting colder out, and we've been noticing some wasps downstairs in the laundry room. there's a kid's playroom down there as well. a door separates the two, but usually it's left open. the wasps were in the play room to start so i sprayed some ant spray along the window sill because it was open a crack, and i haven't found the obstruction to be able to close it properly yet. it worked, i found a row of dead wasps a few days later.

after a few days (a week or two maybe), we closed the door a few times, and noticed the wasps (pretty sure they're yellow jackets) stayed to the laundry room. we'd get 1 or 2 a day. around that time i noticed the wasps flying under our front window. well today i went down and there were 3-4 of them. i still had a good portion left of the ant spray, so i decided it'd be a great idea to spray that area outside and the area inside i thought they were coming from. 

i went downstairs to grab something this afternoon (about 2-3 hours later) and there's like 20+ wasps in the laundry room. flying around the lights. i killed a few and sprayed some more ant spray, but i didn't wanna stick around too long. the fuck up is that we need to do laundry soon, but now have to wait for the wasps to die. we also can't use the kid's play room in case they get through.

on doing some reading, this is the season wasps start to die off in sw ontario, so hopefully they starve and/or get poisoned and we don't get stung.

    Here is the summary: The wasps in the laundry room have increased in number after the author sprayed ant spray in the area, with over 20 wasps now present

    Here is the article: so, i will start this by saying this happened a few years ago. it was my first semester of college and i was seeing a girl, we will call her cassie. cassie was a down to earth girl, real cool, enjoyed sports and we got along very well in class. we spoke in class frequently and after a while decided to meet up on the weekend for a date. things went well, and we became a couple.

i am going to fast forward about 8-9 months here, because the information in that time-span is pointless. i get off of work, and she asks me to come over. it had been a long, busy day and i wanted very much to see her. i drive over, we hang out for a bit. her mom and dad leave to go out for the night, and it's just us. after that door shut, it was fucking on and we started having furious sex. now, cassie had a condition called chiari malformation. a few years before we met, she had to have brain surgery in an attempt to correct it, and in the process of the surgery they took out one of the vertebrae in her neck (i forgot which exact one, but i guess that isn't important.) now.....cassie really enjoyed rough sex. she wanted me to choke her, hit her etc and i was a little freaked out at first, but it was what she liked so i obliged. now, on this night, cassie was getting really into it. mid-coitus, i hear a slight whisper. i couldn't hear her, so i thought she was getting close to gushing. then she speaks up "pull my hair mr. killagoose" so, i grab a hand full of hair and give it a good tug for her. no. that is not what she wanted. "pull my damn hair." i give it a bit harder of a tug. dammit, no. "i said pull my fucking hair you goddamn pussy" and i full on yank that fucking mane back like i'm riding a bronco bareback. 

craaaaaaaack! she unleashes a yelp, and her body seizes up for a second, and then she begins screaming. i didn't have enough to pull my dick out of her because it did the job on its own. i panicked, looking over her as she's laying there crying and screaming that her neck is broken and she can't move. i run and go get my phone to call 911, but she's telling me not to. i have absolutely no idea what is going on at this point, and all i could say was "are you okay?" she starts to calm down, and i can see her legs slowly moving around. she's still crying at this point, but she is saying she is okay. needless to say, for the rest of that relationship, i never pulled her hair again. it was easily the most terrifying moment i have ever had.

    Here is the summary: You had a sexual experience with your girlfriend, Cassie, that resulted in her neck seizing up and her screaming that her neck was broken, due to her Chiari malformation and the fact that she enjoyed rough sex

    Here is the article: tifu by asking my kid to watch cartoons. 


obligatory i'm writing this on mobile and this happened about a month ago. 

  i was trying to get ready for work and my two year old son was being particularly rambunctious this day. i put on cartoons for him in my bedroom so i could be in the bathroom and keep an eye on him while i did my hair and makeup. well he decided that the his favorite cartoon wasn't interesting enough to hold his attention and instead decided it was much more fun to repeatedly open and slam the bathroom door shut. after a few minutes i started getting a little irritated. we're down to one vehicle between my fiancé and i, my toddler wasn't cooperating and i was going to be late to work if my fiancé wasn't back soon. 

  finally, out of frustration i pleaded for my son to please go watch cartoons and he started with a tantrum and went to slam the door shut one more time. i quickly stuck my hand out to prevent the door from slamming in my face one more time and somehow managed to stick my finger right in the opening where the door is connected to the door frame by the hinges. 

  out of reflex, i quickly yanked my hand back in pain. it took a moment for my brain to realize that something wasn't right. i turn my hand over and look down at my finger. 

  the finger tip was gone. i had no nail, and about half an inch of the meat was missing. and then the pain set in. i started freaking out and grabbed my phone and called my fiancé to see how far he was from home. i was hysterical at this point and wasn't talking very clearly. if i remember correctly, i may have screamed that our son just chopped my finger off. not my most graceful moment. luckily he was only about two minutes from home but it felt like it took an eternity. 

  finally i could hear him rushing through the front door and running to our bedroom. two seconds before he got to the bathroom i had looked down at the floor and spotted my finger tip. 

  he rushed in, saw my finger and asked what had happened while he hurriedly searched the cabinet for some gauze to wrap around my finger. i started telling him that he needs to make sure he brings my finger tip in hopes they can reattach it. he asks where it is and i look down to point at the floor and he was stepping on it. 
i screamed at him that he was standing on it and he started screaming oh my god over and over again. 

  he got me and our son into the vehicle and we took off to the emergency room. they were able to reattach it, nail and all but it didn't take and now i just have the dead part of my finger tip just chilling on my finger. 

  managed to lose part of my finger tip, my entire nail and also broke the bone, all because i asked my son to watch some cartoons.

    Here is the article: tifu by asking my kid to watch cartoons. 


obligatory i'm writing this on mobile and this happened about a month ago. 

  i was trying to get ready for work and my two year old son was being particularly rambunctious this day. i put on cartoons for him in my bedroom so i could be in the bathroom and keep an eye on him while i did my hair and makeup. well he decided that the his favorite cartoon wasn't interesting enough to hold his attention and instead decided it was much more fun to repeatedly open and slam the bathroom door shut. after a few minutes i started getting a little irritated. we're down to one vehicle between my fiancé and i, my toddler wasn't cooperating and i was going to be late to work if my fiancé wasn't back soon. 

  finally, out of frustration i pleaded for my son to please go watch cartoons and he started with a tantrum and went to slam the door shut one more time. i quickly stuck my hand out to prevent the door from slamming in my face one more time and somehow managed to stick my finger right in the opening where the door is connected to the door frame by the hinges. 

  out of reflex, i quickly yanked my hand back in pain. it took a moment for my brain to realize that something wasn't right. i turn my hand over and look down at my finger. 

  the finger tip was gone. i had no nail, and about half an inch of the meat was missing. and then the pain set in. i started freaking out and grabbed my phone and called my fiancé to see how far he was from home. i was hysterical at this point and wasn't talking very clearly. if i remember correctly, i may have screamed that our son just chopped my finger off. not my most graceful moment. luckily he was only about two minutes from home but it felt like it took an eternity. 

  finally i could hear him rushing through the front door and running to our bedroom. two seconds before he got to the bathroom i had looked down at the floor and spotted my finger tip. 

  he rushed in, saw my finger and asked what had happened while he hurriedly searched the cabinet for some gauze to wrap around my finger. i started telling him that he needs to make sure he brings my finger tip in hopes they can reattach it. he asks where it is and i look down to point at the floor and he was stepping on it. 
i screamed at him that he was standing on it and he started screaming oh my god over and over again. 

  he got me and our son into the vehicle and we took off to the emergency room. they were able to reattach it, nail and all but it didn't take and now i just have the dead part of my finger tip just chilling on my finger.

    Here is the article: hello, i've only just recently started to visit reddit and i've been reading a lot of tifu posts, so the only fair thing would be to share the biggest fubar fuck up day i've had till now with you fellow redditiers.

this story happened around hm... right about a year ago i guess when i was in the 3rd term of my of my japanese class (jlpt n4). i had started the classes with a friend but he quit after the first term as he failed and didn't bother to pick it up again. 

there were 10 of us in the class, there was me and one other guy together with eight other girls. so, naturally, after the 2nd term ended, i thought about hitting it with one of the girls as the classes had started to get boring and really difficult. i picked my target and started to work on her, we got to know each other in the next two to three weeks and we started dating soon after that. now back when i had just started to initiate the contact with her, she talked about her dad and how he had started to have these pains around the kidney area, it seemed nothing important at first. they thought it  has to be kidney stones, when tests cleared that one, they thought it could be because of a spleen infection, as these event were taking place i was trying my best to be supportive and positive, always assuring her and telling her that there's nothing to worry about. 

by now as we were in the forth or fifth week of our relationship and i'd started to have doubts. i felt that maybe this wasn't the best thing after all, and that we weren't really compatible as i'd came to know two things, one, i was her first boyfriend to my surprise, two, she still had her cherry. she was 18 btw, i was 25. now i wasn't looking for anything serious, and knowing these two things kinda ruined it for me as she was pushing things in towards a very different direction and i didn't wanted to get involved. as it was her first in everything she wanted things to be serious, well it was her first relationship, you can imagine. i wouldn't have mind if i was into her as well but as i said, i just didn't find the connection. 

so about 5 or 6 weeks into the relationship i decide to gradually end things with her. couple of days after that she calls me up and tells me that they've diagnosed her dad with none other than yup, cancer. i'm immediately thinking fuck, i can't break up with her now, i mean she just got the news that her dad has fucking cancer. i'll just give it a couple more days, wait for things to cool off and then break things up.  

so i wait around two weeks, by now they had started to do chemo on her dad, she was relatively calm and composed by now. i thought it to be a right time to end things. one of the following days i call her out to a park to finish things.(breaks up are pretty sad so you can imagine how it went). it was around 11pm on the same night that i get a text from her saying her dads passed away. i mean, i just broke up with someone on the day their dad died... because of cancer in about a month...what the fuck man... needless to say, i felt pretty fucking horrible after that, went to the funeral but, it was it after that. 

i remember feeling pretty horrible at the time...she came to the class a few times but there was only two weeks left till the finals by then. i didn't see her after that.

damn what a fuckin day that was ...

    Here is the summary: The author had a brief relationship with a girl he met in his Japanese class, but he ended up breaking up with her just before her father passed away due to cancer

    Here is the article: to start off, i'm going to admit that this happened to me a few years ago, and i only recently decided that this would be a good story to tell anonymously over the internet. just remember, i'm a very descriptive story teller, but that's what makes it worth it... right? i'm sorry, tl;dr is available at the bottom.

edit: also pretty sure this isn't nsfw material, but apparently vomit is part of the bodily discharge category. not surprising, but you'd think it would be an exception considering the tons of other crazy shit in this subreddit that's allowed...

setting the stage, i was a freshman in high school. my life was pretty good in high school; i was in advanced classes, maintained good grades, had a tight group of friends, and somewhat of a name for myself. i was somewhat of an introvert, and still have that same quality today, but nonetheless, i can't complain about my high school experience.

the story starts with a field trip in my foods class. i never really enjoyed foods. the cooking was fun, but the teacher was very strict with grading and the work load wasn't great either.

plus, the people in the class were different, but weird. there's always those weird stereotypes, but this class was amplified by 100%. there was a dumb blondes, who were also huge sluts, like college guys on their ass daily. there was the ugly bitch that made me hate life. the cliche nerds, the punk kids, the delinquents, etc. let's just summarize what i'm trying to say with, i hated my class and all the kids in it.

on the field trip we were going on, we took a bus to the middle of downtown [insert random metropolitan city here], right on the corner of sketchy drug dealer ally and wrinkly prostitute lane.

the place we went to was a bakery. it was a family bakery with the classic white middle-class family with their only daughter just trying to make a life for themselves in the big city. it was endearing and comfortable inside, but the fact that one step outside could end up in someone getting stabbed was a bit of a turn off.

plus the fact that inside wasn't any better with the ugly bitch on one side of me and the satanic emo on the other. to be honest, i probably would have been more comfortable outside with the muggers than inside with all these people that i hate.

so, by being there, obviously the teacher was trying to get us to experience new cuisine, try new things. personally, she may have just been trying to fatten us up so she could kill us and serve us for the next class to make puberty stew. either way, with the sweet tooth i had, i bought the most cookies and muffins out of the whole class.

i wasn't exactly a big kid either, being 5'6" and around 115 pounds. i had a large metabolism, but of course people didn't notice how much energy i use when i eat, and they wondered where the secret black-hole was where i stored all of my food from that bakery. i swear to you, i spent almost $15.00 on a place that where cookies were sold for a dime a dozen.

to top off my large meal of diabetes and heart pain, i got a very viscous looking coffee. after i finished ordering my feast, everyone was pretty much done, so we got back on the bus and ate the rest of the way back to school.
being in a class with nobody i could trust, i scarfed my food down like i was going into hibernation. after finishing the pile of cookies, i sucked down my coffee, but something was off.

did it burn like hell when it entered my mouth? yes, but that wasn't the problem. did it taste like shit coffee that you would expect to get from a bakery with a c- health rating? yes, and it was terrible, but that wasn't the problem.

before i could figure it out, we made it back to school, just in time for my lunch period to come.

because i just had finished the cookies i had from the bus only minutes prior, my stomach was too dazed by the shit that entered my body to signal i was full. thinking that the cookies were just little, i got a full lunch.

i have no exact memory of what it was, but what was worse than a full lunch was the fact that i thought, "hmmm, i'm sure i could eat more if i just adjusted my pant's waist." so, i went back up there and got another full lunch.

by then, i had consumed about $30.00 of food. two lunches, a full thing of cookies, and a bad coffee later, and i felt full. surprisingly, i wasn't dying, but i think that was because i would probably go into shock if my stomach revealed that the food was crushing my vital organs.

lunch ended as fast as it began, and it was next class for me. it was one of my science classes, and feeling full and energized, i went in proud and ready.

this time in class, we had to do an experiment. for a blood pressure test, me and three other people got together for this experiment. for this test, someone had to run 20 laps around the school's main stairs, and to clarify, these were long ass stairs. running the stairs up and down, especially with how far apart they were and how many laps was probably equivalent to a 5k.

with me being the most fit in the group, as well as a middle school cross country runner (which i would like to clarify was the death of me in middle school), all eyes in the group turned to me for the role of the runner in the experiment.

i felt good, i was full, focused, and confident. my group put trust in me and i was ready to do them proud. we started off with the regular control variables and set up. they took my blood pressure, and found it to be good. obviously the food hadn't made it into my veins yet or it would be atrocious. it's a wonder they even got a pulse at all. like i said though, the food hadn't hit me yet, and i got into position.

they counted down and i was off in a blur. i ran so fast, i forgot about the first 5 laps in an instant. suddenly, the feeling of pain jolted through my body. i blew it off, thinking it was just the normal feeling of a vigorous exercise. i continued running, but my pace felt much slower and more abnormal.

when i finally got to the halfway point, it hit me. my stomach dropped, and i almost blacked out. my vision got blurry and fatigue washed over. it was amazing i didn't just drop dead right there.

before i let the feeling of a stomach explosion wash over, i stopped my thoughts. i took a second to remember, and i told myself, "they are counting on you to get this done, and if you can't do a damn experiment right, how are you ever going to succeed in actual life." this idea kept my vomit down and my shit in my colon.

i felt important. i toughed off the feeling and continued running. as much as i felt like a hero, as i passed my group, i knew they saw something else. they could tell that i was probably decomposing right in front of them. my skin could have been peeling off then, or my face may have twisted and convulsed into that of a stroke victim. it didn't matter, i was going to do finish what i started.

i made it to the end of my run, all 20 laps, and now that i think about it, one more for good measure (fuck you for that, group). i went up to the partner with the blood pressure cuffs in her hand. pretty girl, and also very smart.

i think at that point i was literally crawling on my hands and knees. i got over to her, and sat down. she put it around my arm and took my blood pressure. she took it off after finding it, and before i had the chance to look, i excused my self.

as i started walking away, like a person with a broken rib and a leg i must add, i said "i think i'm going to the bathroom to throw up right now." obviously, i was joking, but right on cue, my stomach heard the words "throw up" and immediately realized, "oh yea, that's how we can stop this terrible pain."

at the point, i realized why my coffee seemed off. it was the most acidic coffee i ever had in my life. the drink was like the pots of acid people fall into in the movie and melt away alive.

my stomach apparently thought the same thing, because the moment i mentioned throwing up, the fat man was released.

at first, the spillage began on my sweatshirt that i held in my hands since i took it off to run.

even though i had is wrapped around my vomit like a little sac, i thought halfway through, "there's no way the 10 gallons in my stomach is gonna fit in a piece of cloth that holds less than a pint before leaking or spilling."

then, i threw the sweatshirt down, with an audible splat. i think my partners behind me only then realized what was happening. they finally looked up from their notes and data, one of them saying, "i think he's actually throwing up..." well mr. lab partner, i believe you sir were correct.

i turned back in time, only to see the girl's face. it was the face of someone who just lost all comfort. she looked like she just watched someone die, with a terribly horrified look and a hand covering her mouth.

i not only felt terribly physically now, but heavily damaged emotionally. i was sorry for throwing up.
after my sweatshirt hit the floor in a splatter of half-digested lunch, it was like i could feel the 3 lab partners behind me as their head's turned to me. might as well put on a show...

i took a second to find the nearest recycling bin, because you know, some hobo in a recycling plant could eat this.

before i could make it though, i find myself spewing across the hall from the bin.

i swear to god it traveled like 12 feet.

thinking i was totally going to undershoot the bin, i ran towards it as fast as possible. turns out nothing was undershot, because everything that missed the bin traveled farther than i thought it would.

at least i hit a pretty good back board, but that wall was going to take a long time to heal after that. i finally discharged all stomach excrement after heaving into the bin for 5 minutes straight.

when i stop and look back, my lab partners were gone, equipment and everything, disappeared like the roanoke colony, only the gross sweatshirt pile to be seen in the hallway.

tears streaming from my eyes, i left all of the evidence of vomit behind, and stumbled to the nearest bathroom. when i got there, i happened to meet my friend. "oh god, this is the best thing that could happen now..." i thought, and i tried to pass him into the bathroom.

too bad he was leaving the bathroom, so we were forced to face each other as we walked by through the doorway. "hey anon!" he said as he raised his hand for a high five. he seemed to be completely ignorant of the pain i was in and the shit that covered my body.

being covered in vomit, i politely declined his offer saying, "not right now, i just threw up all over myself." he then put his hand down, looks at me with the most disgusted look he could possibly give me, says "ew", and walks away. now i'm not only covered in shit, but i feel like shit. he didn't talk to me as much after that.

after i clean myself up and come back to the scene of the crime from the bathroom, i find my sweatshirt gone, and my teacher standing there waiting for me. the first thing she asks me is, "did you at least get the results?"

her obviously trying to break her gaze from the recycling bin, she sends me to the nurse and goes back to class. i make it to the nurse, finding she has bagged my vomit filled sweatshirt. she tells me to got pick out another shirt, since my undershirt also suffered some damage. thank god the vomit didn't cover my pants or shoes.

i go to look at the clothes available, and the only shirt they have is a hoodie 3 sizes too small. are you fucking kidding me? i have to put on the shirt, because they're not letting me out there with bare chested.

when i put it on, the hoodie fits me like a crop top, exposing my skinny ass, hairy belly to the world. "maybe i can go out in the vomit shirt and no one will notice!?" how positive of me, but we all know that's not going to happen, so i hike up my crop top and finish school.

obviously, i got shit for the hoodie from everyone, there was no doubt, but the nurse also forced me to carry my vomit sweatshirt and undershirt in a bag for the rest of the day. i couldn't leave it anywhere because it would leave a smell, so now i'm a walking hoodie slut with a smell of year old garbage dump following me around in a bag that looks like satan himself took a shit.

people across campus knew who vomited on the wall too, for the janitor didn't get to it before the next passing period started, and the guy carrying the vomit in a bag is just strolling through school for people to see in a crop top. wasn't that hard of a gamble to assume he was the one who threw up.

my reputation was ruined, and it took years for everyone to stop bringing it up and forget. soon i would begin to own up to it, cause if i didn't, the suicidal thoughts would have won by now.

in hind site, i probably could have just left, but i was too busy thinking about how i was going to kill myself when i get home to think about it. turns out the bakery that had the coffee and cookies closed down a year after, rejoice to that! and hey, at least we can wait to see if the janitor has a tifu on this... now that would be interesting.

    Here is the summary: The author, a high school student, had a disastrous field trip to a bakery where they consumed a large amount of food and drink, leading to a painful and embarrassing experience of vomiting in front of their classmates

because i just had finished the cookies i had from the bus only minutes prior, my stomach was too dazed by the shit that entered my body to signal i was full. thinking that the cookies were just little, i got a full lunch.

i have no exact memory of what it was, but what was worse than a full lunch was the fact that i thought, "hmmm, i'm sure i could eat more if i just adjusted my pant's waist." so, i went back up there and got another full lunch.

by then, i had consumed about $30.00 of food. two lunches, a full thing of cookies, and a bad coffee later, and i felt full. surprisingly, i wasn't dying, but i think that was because i would probably go into shock if my stomach revealed that the food was crushing my vital organs.

lunch ended as fast as it began, and it was next class for me. it was one of my science classes, and feeling full and energized, i went in proud and ready.

this time in class, we had to do an experiment. for a blood pressure test, me and three other people got together for this experiment. for this test, someone had to run 20 laps around the school's main stairs, and to clarify, these were long ass stairs. running the stairs up and down, especially with how far apart they were and how many laps was probably equivalent to a 5k.

with me being the most fit in the group, as well as a middle school cross country runner (which i would like to clarify was the death of me in middle school), all eyes in the group turned to me for the role of the runner in the experiment.

i felt good, i was full, focused, and confident. my group put trust in me and i was ready to do them proud. we started off with the regular control variables and set up. they took my blood pressure, and found it to be good. obviously the food hadn't made it into my veins yet or it would be atrocious. it's a wonder they even got a pulse at all. like i said though, the food hadn't hit me yet, and i got into position.

they counted down and i was off in a blur. i ran so fast, i forgot about the first 5 laps in an instant. suddenly, the feeling of pain jolted through my body. i blew it off, thinking it was just the normal feeling of a vigorous exercise. i continued running, but my pace felt much slower and more abnormal.

when i finally got to the halfway point, it hit me. my stomach dropped, and i almost blacked out. my vision got blurry and fatigue washed over. it was amazing i didn't just drop dead right there.

before i let the feeling of a stomach explosion wash over, i stopped my thoughts. i took a second to remember, and i told myself, "they are counting on you to get this done, and if you can't do a damn experiment right, how are you ever going to succeed in actual life." this idea kept my vomit down and my shit in my colon.

i felt important. i toughed off the feeling and continued running. as much as i felt like a hero, as i passed my group, i knew they saw something else. they could tell that i was probably decomposing right in front of them. my skin could have been peeling off then, or my face may have twisted and convulsed into that of a stroke victim. it didn't matter, i was going to do finish what i started.

i made it to the end of my run, all 20 laps, and now that i think about it, one more for good measure (fuck you for that, group). i went up to the partner with the blood pressure cuffs in her hand. pretty girl, and also very smart.

i think at that point i was literally crawling on my hands and knees. i got over to her, and sat down. she put it around my arm and took my blood pressure. she took it off after finding it, and before i had the chance to look, i excused my self.

as i started walking away, like a person with a broken rib and a leg i must add, i said "i think i'm going to the bathroom to throw up right now." obviously, i was joking, but right on cue, my stomach heard the words "throw up" and immediately realized, "oh yea, that's how we can stop this terrible pain."

at the point, i realized why my coffee seemed off. it was the most acidic coffee i ever had in my life. the drink was like the pots of acid people fall into in the movie and melt away alive.

my stomach apparently thought the same thing, because the moment i mentioned throwing up, the fat man was released.

at first, the spillage began on my sweatshirt that i held in my hands since i took it off to run.

even though i had is wrapped around my vomit like a little sac, i thought halfway through, "there's no way the 10 gallons in my stomach is gonna fit in a piece of cloth that holds less than a pint before leaking or spilling."

then, i threw the sweatshirt down, with an audible splat. i think my partners behind me only then realized what was happening. they finally looked up from their notes and data, one of them saying, "i think he's actually throwing up..." well mr. lab partner, i believe you sir were correct.

i turned back in time, only to see the girl's face. it was the face of someone who just lost all comfort. she looked like she just watched someone die, with a terribly horrified look and a hand covering her mouth.

i not only felt terribly physically now, but heavily damaged emotionally. i was sorry for throwing up.
after my sweatshirt hit the floor in a splatter of half-digested lunch, it was like i could feel the 3 lab partners behind me as their head's turned to me. might as well put on a show...

i took a second to find the nearest recycling bin, because you know, some hobo in a recycling plant could eat this.

before i could make it though, i find myself spewing across the hall from the bin.

i swear to god it traveled like 12 feet.

thinking i was totally going to undershoot the bin, i ran towards it as fast as possible. turns out nothing was undershot, because everything that missed the bin traveled farther than i thought it would.

at least i hit a pretty good back board, but that wall was going to take a long time to heal after that. i finally discharged all stomach excrement after heaving into the bin for 5 minutes straight.

when i stop and look back, my lab partners were gone, equipment and everything, disappeared like the roanoke colony, only the gross sweatshirt pile to be seen in the hallway.

tears streaming from my eyes, i left all of the evidence of vomit behind, and stumbled to the nearest bathroom. when i got there, i happened to meet my friend. "oh god, this is the best thing that could happen now..." i thought, and i tried to pass him into the bathroom.

too bad he was leaving the bathroom, so we were forced to face each other as we walked by through the doorway. "hey anon!" he said as he raised his hand for a high five. he seemed to be completely ignorant of the pain i was in and the shit that covered my body.

being covered in vomit, i politely declined his offer saying, "not right now, i just threw up all over myself." he then put his hand down, looks at me with the most disgusted look he could possibly give me, says "ew", and walks away. now i'm not only covered in shit, but i feel like shit. he didn't talk to me as much after that.

after i clean myself up and come back to the scene of the crime from the bathroom, i find my sweatshirt gone, and my teacher standing there waiting for me. the first thing she asks me is, "did you at least get the results?"

her obviously trying to break her gaze from the recycling bin, she sends me to the nurse and goes back to class. i make it to the nurse, finding she has bagged my vomit filled sweatshirt. she tells me to got pick out another shirt, since my undershirt also suffered some damage. thank god the vomit didn't cover my pants or shoes.

i go to look at the clothes available, and the only shirt they have is a hoodie 3 sizes too small. are you fucking kidding me? i have to put on the shirt, because they're not letting me out there with bare chested.

when i put it on, the hoodie fits me like a crop top, exposing my skinny ass, hairy belly to the world. "maybe i can go out in the vomit shirt and no one will notice!?" how positive of me, but we all know that's not going to happen, so i hike up my crop top and finish school.

obviously, i got shit for the hoodie from everyone, there was no doubt, but the nurse also forced me to carry my vomit sweatshirt and undershirt in a bag for the rest of the day. i couldn't leave it anywhere because it would leave a smell, so now i'm a walking hoodie slut with a smell of year old garbage dump following me around in a bag that looks like satan himself took a shit.

people across campus knew who vomited on the wall too, for the janitor didn't get to it before the next passing period started, and the guy carrying the vomit in a bag is just strolling through school for people to see in a crop top. wasn't that hard of a gamble to assume he was the one who threw up.

my reputation was ruined, and it took years for everyone to stop bringing it up and forget. soon i would begin to own up to it, cause if i didn't, the suicidal thoughts would have won by now.

in hind site, i probably could have just left, but i was too busy thinking about how i was going to kill myself when i get home to think about it. turns out the bakery that had the coffee and cookies closed down a year after, rejoice to that! and hey, at least we can wait to see if the janitor has a tifu on this... now that would be interesting.

    Here is the summary: The author, a high school student, had a disastrous field trip to a bakery where they consumed a large amount of food and drink, leading to a painful and embarrassing experience of vomiting in front of their classmates

    Output format: PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE, PERCENTAGE

    Evaluation Criteria:
    1. Read the news article carefully and identify the main topic and key points.
    2. Read the summary and compare it to the news article. Check if the summary covers the main topic and key points of the news article, and if it resents them in a clear and logical order.
    3. Rate the summary with 5 percentages, where each one represents how likely the summary is going to get a score from 1 to 5. For example, if you think the summary is 80% likely to get a score of 5, 10% likely to get a score of 4, 5% likely to get a score of 3, 3% likely to get a score of 2, and 1% likely to get a score of 1, you should rate the summary as 80, 10, 5, 3, 2.

    Here is the article: tifu by calling my father's insurance agency to get my own policy. i just bought a cheap car a week ago and have been trying to get it registered but in order to do so i needed proof of insurance. my father originally wanted me to transfer the title to him so he could put the car under his policy but me being the idiotic twenty something i am, wanted to keep the car in my name and pay the difference in cost of insurance to my dad ( an extra $60s on my end for 6 months, a pretty good deal in my head). while talking to the insurance rep on the phone going over my policy this morning she asked "have you had any accidents in the past 3 years?". well yes but only one of them was reported to insurance, a minor fender tap under 5 mph because the lady in front of me had stopped short. the other one was 2 years ago when i hydroplaned and my car ended up in a ditch, totaled. i told the insurance rep about both forgetting the hydroplanning incident had never been reported because the car was a loss and the police never ticketed me (according to the officer there really wasn't anything he saw that he could ticket me for.) the insurance rep paused and told me she was going to have to do a more in depth search and call me back. two hours later i get a ring and she tells me that she told the other insurance agency my dad is with about the accident and they have it down now as a $0-1800 accident which now means i would have two points. 1 point is waive-able but with two points they both get charged (who came up with that system??), of and now my premium just went up $200... so now my father is mad at me because he got another point on his insurance and the likelihood that im gonna be able to insure this car is dubious at best, and im still no where closer to getting the truck registered then i was a week ago. all because i thought having my shitty $1000 truck was worth keeping in my name, because "i'm an adult now"

    Here is the summary: The author's attempt to get their own insurance policy for their cheap car ended in disaster when they forgot to mention a previous accident, resulting in a $200 increase in premium and two points on their father's insurance policy

    Here is the article: this actually happened yesterday, so it's relatively fresh 

right, so at the moment i am at disney world orlando with my dad and little sister. my sister is 10 and i am 17. as my sister is a dumbass and can't walk in a straight line as she is looking at all the disney shenanigans, i sometimes put my hand on her back and guide her through the crowds.

now the fuck up:
we are walking in a big crowd towards the haunted mansion and i see my sister walking the wrong way so without really paying attention i again start guiding her for a few minutes. when we get to the haunted mansion i look down and realise, that's not my sister. she was wearing similar clothes and looked similar but this was definitely not my sister. fuck. that's also when my dad noticed. i had managed to lose my sister, and kidnap someone else's daughter at the same time.

luckily ad disney they are used to lost kids, petrified parents and confused siblings/ child thief's and managed to find the girls parents. and sadly, they found my sister too.

 

edit: haunted mansion not haunted house

wow okay this has blown up, i'm glad you are all enjoying my sisters misfortunes.

    Here is the article: yeah so naturally like all tifu goes, this didn't happen today. more like a couple months ago; but it could have happened today, thankfully not. 

i live in queensland, australia. yes, australia has *scary* animals: crocodiles, koalas, birds with cool [mohawks] (http://www.activityvillage.co.uk/sites/default/files/images/images2/cockatoos_for_kids_300.jpg), and clive palmer. but we move right passed it, but sometimes they do intrude on our daily activities. this story involves one. 

this one day i had my girlfriend over. we wanted to watch a film, but we didn't know what one. so we decided to just go see whats on the television. we sit on the couch, lean back and then we see a tail go underneath the couch. it was a snake. a snake was thirdwheeling our tv date :( 

so we got up and freaked the fuck out because snakes can get aggressive, and can be deadly. i have this card on the fridge for a snake catcher, so i get her a call. little info on the australian snake catcher: people open their own businesses relating to the capture of snakes; these people come from all backgrounds, this snake catcher was a single mother. they come around to your house in a van, or in this case a minivan; with ropes, sticks, pointy sticks, ropes on sticks and a bag to put the snake in. 

the lady came over, told us to stay back and she then asked us what sort of colour the snake was. i can't really can't remember what sort of colour it was, but she said it wasn't lethal. the logical method of capturing a non-lethal snake would usually be the same as lethal snake: with pre-caution. however, the lady just moved the couch, shined a torch in the face of mr. snake, then got her stick and poked it. she pulled it out with the stick and the snake started trying to attack her, but she just threw it in the bag. 

we gave her the $100 for the snake catching and she was on her way.

    Here is the article: mandatory text saying this didn't happen today, optional text saying this actually happened around a year ago. i remembered this because of [this fu](http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/39zxkr/tifu_my_relationship_today/).

i was browsing craigslist and i found this ad from a guy saying he was looking for a girl with needs (that weren't sexual) and that he was willing to make up for them in exchange of some company. i replied because i was visiting the town on business (mountain view) and well, even though i didn't have any actual needs, i thought it'd be cool to meet someone and maybe go for dinner or lunch. surprise! he replied and we actually happened to have a lot in common. he is into the videogame industry (developing for vr) and i am too (environment designer), we are around the same age (i was 28, he was 31) and he looked very kind and interesting, so hey, score!

we arranged to meet on a friday evening and he went to pick me up to my hotel in his awesome car so we could drive to palo alto to have dinner. we talked a lot in the way there and when we got to the town, he couldn't choose what to eat, so we decided to walk the whole street (i believe it's called castro?) to see what looked good. we walked and conversed without even noticing we reached the end of said street, so he told me about this super fancy thai restaurant he ended taking me to. we spent like 3 more hours talking about many things, including his colour-blindness and me being a fifty shades of grey (i'm a virgin, don't judge). i noticed him looking at me while i was browsing the menu, so i got a bit giddy about it. we talked and had a great evening filled with laughter and great food. after that, i told him about a korean bakery i love that is also there and he took me to buy pastries and desserts and we spent an hour and a half more there talking and just chilling. as it was getting dark, we headed back to his car, not without stopping before a creamery for a late night milk shake and a sandwich (we love eating, i guess) and more conversation, so, it was a pretty great night all around. i was flying back the next day, but i frankly didn't want to leave after meeting him. nevertheless, we continued talking for a while as i returned to my country and he seemed to be fine talking to me every now and then, and i was waiting to see him again because i was going back to mv in a month after that and i honestly found him very attractive, and he seemed to enjoy my conversations as well... and because he also promised to take me to a frozen custard place too. unfortunately, one night, i was a bit high and he was on skype, and i decided to tell him i was super into him and that i really liked him (i didn't get to say the l word). the day after, when i realized what i did, i apologized hoping he wouldn't find me creepy. he never talked to me again :(

so my team traveled 4 hours away to pennsylvania from home to provide 24/7 support for a big software upgrade. things went so well that we finished up a day early and got ready to head back. 

rental car is packed up and i press the close button on the trunk door. reach into my pocket and pull out my personal car keys, not the rental. the "oh fuck" moment sets in that i just locked the keys in the trunk. 

call the rental company to get a hold of onstar to unlock the car. just so happens they never set up onstar in this car. so we have to wait for aaa to show up. 

aaa shows up. they begin working their magic. just so happens they have no magic. they leave us i the hotel parking lot with a very locked car. tell us someone else should be coming soon to try and open it. 

still waiting on the next person to come and attempt to unlock our car.

    Here is the article: i fucked up yesterday, big time.

my high school is a total non-cheating nazi, if they find out a student cheats on a quiz, exam, or homework. there will be harsh consequences for anyone caught cheating or giving information about tests/quizzes.
	
in algebra 2, we go over a system of linear equations worksheet; it was also the last class of the day. the professor finished class reviewing and i just place the worksheet inside my binder (note it was a 2”, so it was hard to grab it with one hand since i’m small). i didn’t open the rings or placed it inside a binder folder, i simply slid the worksheet inside and placed my binder on the floor (1st fuck up).

the teacher starts handing out quizzes and i receive mine. when i finished the last equation of the quiz, i looked at my watch and noticed there were 3 minutes left before the bell rang. so i moved my quiz aside and started to pack my things up. i grabbed my binder with one hand (2nd fuck up), suddenly the binder opens because of my small hands and the worksheet fell out of my binder and traveled a good 3 inches away from me (3rd fuck up). i placed my binder inside my backpack and stretched to reach the worksheet. suddenly, the professor finally sees me and shouts my name out loud to come see him. he then asks me why i was trying to grab a paper on the floor and i explain that it fell from my binder. i suddenly start to get the feeling he didn’t believe me, so i give him the worksheet as proof (4th fuck up). i then witness his face go from “police inspector” to “you’re going down motherfucker”. he doesn’t believe me, sends me to see the principal, i stay afterschool for 2 more hours explaining that i was not cheating and it was just a simple accident. long story short, the principal doesn’t believe me either and calls my parents, i loose eligibility on entering nhs and student president, have to go to a saturday detention, automatically get a 0 on the quiz, and worst of all is that it will show up that i “cheated” during a quiz to colleges.
i am now writing this having 5 minutes before going to school to serve saturday detention.

    Here is the summary: The author had a series of unfortunate events during their algebra class, resulting in them being accused of cheating and facing severe consequences, including losing eligibility for extracurricular activities and potentially damaging their college applications

For example, if you think the summary is 80% likely to get a score of 5, 10% likely to get a score of 4, 5% likely to get a score of 3, 3% likely to get a score of 2, and 1% likely to get a score of 1, you should rate the summary as 80, 10, 5, 3, 2.

    Here is the article: i probably don't have to warn you that this is going to get disgusting.

i unexpectedly had a night off work the night before last, so i did what i typically do in these sort of situations: get blackout drunk and eat terrible delivery food.  i was playing some pc games with my friends and someone was ordering from papa john's and joked about getting this abomination of american gluttony called the chili fritos pizza, which is exactly what it sounds like.  so being blackout drunk, i decided i must have one.

well i somehow managed to eat this whole pizza in the span of 12 hours, and woke up with a raging hangover and the bubblegut.  i'd had a bad hemorrhoid for about a week up to this point, and shitting 5 times in a couple hours had enflamed my asshole to the point i was starting to wonder if a colony of fire ants had made a new home in my anus.

i barely made it through the 2 1/2 hour drive to washington dc for work without crapping my pants, and immediately rushed for the bathroom.  after a 20 minute poop and tenderly wiping while trying to avoid contact with my now hideously engorged hemorrhoid, i checked in with our client.  she has a bad habit of talking for hours at a time, and tonight she was feeling particularly chatty.  

i stood for an hour listening to her talk, and suddenly i felt my stomach bubble again.  i had to fart in the worst way, but i also knew there was a good chance it would be a shart and even if it wasn't it would stink.  so i crossed my legs casually and squeezed my cheeks to hold it in.  i felt an intense stabbing sensation in my ass and then something warm running down my leg. 

i stifled back the tears, and then i realized the predicament i was now in.  i'd ruptured my hemorrhoid and my ass was now bleeding profusely in a meeting with the owner of a $44 million dollar building and our company's biggest client.  i tried to casually break away and back out of the room so she wouldn't see my bloodstained pants, but to my dismay she started to follow me out.  she got a few feet away and her face screwed up and went pale.  i'd been too panicked and distracted by the pain and hadn't noticed the awful stench emanating from my rear.

at this point i explained i wasn't feeling well and ran to the restroom where i hid until she left for the night.  i'm currently laying on my stomach in a bed of shame.

(does twitter even have an edit function?) i deleted the tweet, but to my dismay, a notification popped up. at first i was like cool, but i had to delete it. then i actually read it (really wanted to type reddit here). apparently, in the 5 seconds my tweet was up, the official reddit account favorited and retweeted it telling others to retweet, and i had just deleted it.

    Here is the article: i'll preface this by saying that i am a regular pencil kind of guy; i have no malice towards mechanical pencils and i'm sure that these one's in particular don't represent all mechanical pencils.  

so it's the first week of college and my second class of calculus. all of my regular pencils are not sharpened so i decide to use my only mechanical pencil.

everything is going fine. i'm taking notes, learning the material, all is well. it is now the last 30 mins of class and my pencil breaks. a piece of graphite snapped on the inside and was blocking all of the new graphite from coming out. "no problem" i thought. i'll just take out the graphite and stick through the front to get it unstuck...wrong. the graphite snapped and fell all over the table and on the floor.

at this point i know that my pencil is a liability and i ask my friend if i can borrow one of his pencils. he hands me a mechanical pencil -_-. i accept it and begin to write with the new pencil my friend has given me and it is working fine.  

now, 10 mins left in class and i notice that i made a mistake in an equation and as i go to erase the mistake, the mechanical pencil **explodes.** i assume the spring inside was broken because when i put pressure on the eraser, the shell casing went flying to the table in front of me, all of the graphite spilled onto the desk and the eraser component flew out of my hand onto the floor!

i lost my mind at this point. i began to laugh so hard but under my breath to not make noise (everyone knows that laughter multiplies by x100 when you know your not suppose to laugh). i can't believe what is happening to me in the final minutes of class and i just break down in quiet laughter. my body is shaking from trying to contain my laughter, i start to sweat and tear up from trying to contain it all. once i muster up enough strength, i leave class to catch myself and my breath. i come in all calm and cool and as soon as i sit down i hear my friend still snickering and i lose it again. at this point the teacher either catches on or has had enough and calls me out in the middle of class. he stops class and asks "are you ok, whats so funny hmm?" in an irritated angry voice. that whole class turns to me and the laughter stopped immediately. when i went to explain myself he interjects with "i don't have time for this, we're running out of time."

luckily, he seemed to either be ok with it or just didn't care when i went up and explained what happened after class. all i know is that i am from now on a strictly regular wooden pencil person now.

    Here is the article: throwaway for obvious reasons.
post is long. cannot style right now, my mind is somewhere else.  apologize making such a long and shitty post. but oh well. i have to do it


today i learned one thing, which hit the nail on coffin. but before i get to it, a prologue.

you know what they used to say. love your parents, they wish only the good for you. good intentions and all that jazz. i believed it. that was a mistake. a big one.

from the earliest days as i remember, my mom was good to everyone. even me. but when i screwed up, i was always the bad kid. any screwup and im going down. you know what mom, lets go back into the past.

remember when i was a 5 year old kid? i do. we were standing by the atm and getting money. i put my hands by where the money would come out, the money hit my hands and went inside. an innocent mistake, i didn't mean no harm.  
but you spent hours telling me how me my friends and relatives will suffer, because we're not gonna go to mc d's. because i fucked up and i didn't think it trough. everyone was so eager to go there, but now they will be hungry and have to eat at home, because it was all my fault. and oh i do remember the phrase to this day "now how they will think of you".  

i hate that phrase, try saying it to a kid near me, and i'm gonna whoop your ass.

ofcourse, everyone knew it was my fuckup. it was my fuckup and no birthday party for me nor anybody. bad kid. you are inferior.

it was always like this, you do something that she doesn't like you are inferior. not "undisciplined", inferior. remember? oh do you rememer when i showed you that i predicted a result of a scientific study? i was fucking twelve. but nope, it didn't matter. it didn't matter because bobby got an a in math while i had a b.  

remember, in 4th grade, i asked you to buy me a new school bag. because all others had non-kiddy ones. remember? you said we didn't have money, you said mine was fine and i should study harder. that i should look at daniel, who lives with a single mother and wears second-hand clothes. look how he loves her. look how good of a kid he is, not you ungrateful brat.  
i remember, i went to a shop and bought a $3 bag, which i used for the next 3 years.

oh do you recall what happened when i didn't want to go to my grandpas birthday? "grandpa loves you so much, and you don't love him. you will upset him and he will cry".

and the whole "i am older and your mom. and you're a piece of shit". crap, i remember coming to a friends house and being in trance from seeing that his mom talked to him like an equal. i was shocked, it hit me like a truck. why, what. i didn't understand why in the fuck would a parent talk to his kid like an equal. it felt good, but, so unnatural. it never really dawned on me.

crap, do you remember my clothing? i had to walk like i was living in the 70's at grandmas, because it was "cool" you've said. we weren't poor. our poor relatives managed to go on a vacation abroad. we were making twice as them. we lived in a shittier apt, we wore shittier clothes and eat worse food.  

oh remember how you berated me, that i help my aunt with the dishes while i don't do them at home. that i'm an asslicker and don't love you? i didn't know then, i thought that i was indeed a bad person. i remember how the aunts family was always cheerful and treated others better. aunt talked to me, she was interested in my life. but i didnt know why i helped her. i wanted to help her, i loved spending time at her place.  

and you know, money. to this day i can perfectly recipe all the accents in the phrase "we dont have money". you and my stepdad made a shitton of money, but we never had enough. never had enough to let me go somewhere with my friends. or wait, do you think it was accidental that i started drinking at 15? $3 got you drunk and made life better for 6 hrs. or why i wasted so much time at the computer? yeah, because it was cheap. because we never had money for me to go somewhere. when i took my first job at 15 you made me pay 30% of my salary for my martial arts class. also for the flat/food and transport faire. i'm a bad ungrateful kid you said, i stopped doing sports. i was home at midnight. and because i was making money, no fucking allowance. because we had no moooooneeeeeeeeeeey.  

ironic, that you always had money to go and drink cofee with friends, you always had money to buy buns at the shop. that bag of cookies? yup. oh you always had money for another "eastern meditation" guy. you know, his kids were better than me. oh, and all those eastern bullshit courses you visited. yes ofcourse we had no money. it didn't matter that my pc was dying (i can ressurect pc's easily now). it didn't matter that it caused me great grief. we had no money, because we were poor. but that indian guy helped you improve your chakra.

oh remember how you liked to remember that i'm a burden on you, and without you i will die. because whatever energy coming from you will stop? yeah i do. remember how you liked to count my money?  oh i do. i asked stepdad for $20 he gave me $40. welp, one week without an allowance. cos fuck you.

money money money. it was always about money. look how poor that grandma is. look at her and see how she counts the pennies. see how bad others have it. but we have it slightly less worse. remember? yeah, i hated money. i still get this horrible feeling in my gut when i see people counting money. i hate taking money from people. i couldn't do it. it was horrible.  

and the family. you played the fucking victim infront of the whole family. "but we're so poor" my ass. my kid isn't studying, he is lazy, and i am a poor soul. word by word. yeah, about that. i told you i had heart issues, i couldn't sleep properly. going to sleep meant lying in bed for hours on end, and waking up was a victory. i prayed for a doctor to look at me over a few days. but, i was faking. because i didn't want to go to school.

oh remember school? my auntie still thinks i failed school on purpose. and the university? yup, she thinks i was bad and was removed from there because of my bad marks. lets not tell her that i left uni because you stole all the money grandma gave for it. all of fucking it. all of it. you havent paid jack shit. none. zero. bitch. and told my auntie, my beloved auntie that i was lazy. i was studying in top 3 uni, and was above everyone else. fuck, didnt study my ass. fucking all of the money, christ. you never told me. i didnt know grandma gave the money. i don't know who else funded. my bio-dad? holyshit if he did. i didnt see a penny. fuck, what if he was sending me money all this time? lord.

i was a wreck. depressed suicidal lost. i came to you and said that the stress is killing me and im going mad. "don't bother me when im watching tv". shit.
it took me years to get back on my feet. thanks for the pouridge.

i blamed myself for everything. anything that bad happens that isn't even remotely my fault, i blamed myself. i couldn't stop. my auntie thought i was lazy and useless and that i was faking. grandma is 80, and shit. only my friends and their parents were there for me. they were the light in the darkness. 
trough blood and sweat i got out. i got a job. i reworked my brain. oh, remember thsoe studies i predicted as a kid? yup, they helped. don't know what i would do without them.  
im on my legs and im here. i am stronger, but my nerves and body would argue about that. and you, now you are finally poor and jobless.

you know, i forgave you. i forgave all the offenses, i forgave all the inferior child. i fixed myself, rewired my brain. i don't feel anger, i dont feel pain.

but today. today i learned a lot about you.

i know grandma gave you shittons of money. yeah, grandmas well off. she gave you money and you took it. and loaned on top of that. i know that you sold mlm bullshit to grandma. she's 80, she forgets things. christ. this is dusgusting.  
i know you loaned money from friends and didnt give back. no wonder you don't have any friends by now. none at all. 
i know you loaned money from my auntie. and out other relatives. and didnt give it back.

but thats nothing. my little sis, she's twelve now, she was saving money for a pc of her own. she likes to play sims, but she had to use that old pc that i used. when i was her age, yeah the chip was a pentium 4 3ghz and not a 2.4ghz (you're welcome sis). she was saving and had $300, enough for half. step-dad promised to help her with money so that she could buy herself a new pc. in the end, grandma and stepdad had to not buy her a new display, and go with a mediocre build. anythings better than that cursed pentium.

and you stole that money. woman, you stole that childs money. childs? your childs. the child you treat the same as me when i was a kid. she's depressed. she doesn't have friends. she thinks of herself as a pos. and you steal her money on top of that. you stole a fucking childs money. childs money. the child that still loves you. and you still call her an ungrateful bitch for not doing something.

i'm not angry. i feel betrayed. i feel, as though my dog shat on a carpet and then rolled on it. a new low perhaps. i am disgusted. but not angry. thanks for giving me practice.

the kid doesn't know. she thinks she lost them. i used to blame grandma when money dissapeared from me when i was young. heh grandma. she never did any bad to anyone, im sorry grandms.

and in the end, fuck you, our "indian energy" supplier. fuck you, you poor mother whose children dont love her. fuck you, for the suffering you brought upon those who you were supposed to protect.

and if someone asks me, why i think having children should be a licences afair, this is your answer.


this is disgusting. but praise the gods, for i am over it. and i am the one in control.


some clarification: my mom and stepdad are both top notch engineers. both of them had good positions in big companies.  
grandma gets money from grandad, who is a air force veteran. his pension is big.

    Here is the article: throwaway for obvious reasons.
post is long. cannot style right now, my mind is somewhere else.  apologize making such a long and shitty post. but oh well. i have to do it


today i learned one thing, which hit the nail on coffin. but before i get to it, a prologue.

you know what they used to say. love your parents, they wish only the good for you. good intentions and all that jazz. i believed it. that was a mistake. a big one.

from the earliest days as i remember, my mom was good to everyone. even me. but when i screwed up, i was always the bad kid. any screwup and im going down. you know what mom, lets go back into the past.

remember when i was a 5 year old kid? i do. we were standing by the atm and getting money. i put my hands by where the money would come out, the money hit my hands and went inside. an innocent mistake, i didn't mean no harm.  
but you spent hours telling me how me my friends and relatives will suffer, because we're not gonna go to mc d's. because i fucked up and i didn't think it trough. everyone was so eager to go there, but now they will be hungry and have to eat at home, because it was all my fault. and oh i do remember the phrase to this day "now how they will think of you".  

i hate that phrase, try saying it to a kid near me, and i'm gonna whoop your ass.

ofcourse, everyone knew it was my fuckup. it was my fuckup and no birthday party for me nor anybody. bad kid. you are inferior.

it was always like this, you do something that she doesn't like you are inferior. not "undisciplined", inferior. remember? oh do you rememer when i showed you that i predicted a result of a scientific study? i was fucking twelve. but nope, it didn't matter. it didn't matter because bobby got an a in math while i had a b.  

remember, in 4th grade, i asked you to buy me a new school bag. because all others had non-kiddy ones. remember? you said we didn't have money, you said mine was fine and i should study harder. that i should look at daniel, who lives with a single mother and wears second-hand clothes. look how he loves her. look how good of a kid he is, not you ungrateful brat.  
i remember, i went to a shop and bought a $3 bag, which i used for the next 3 years.

oh do you recall what happened when i didn't want to go to my grandpas birthday? "grandpa loves you so much, and you don't love him. you will upset him and he will cry".

and the whole "i am older and your mom. and you're a piece of shit". crap, i remember coming to a friends house and being in trance from seeing that his mom talked to him like an equal. i was shocked, it hit me like a truck. why, what. i didn't understand why in the fuck would a parent talk to his kid like an equal. it felt good, but, so unnatural. it never really dawned on me.

crap, do you remember my clothing? i had to walk like i was living in the 70's at grandmas, because it was "cool" you've said. we weren't poor. our poor relatives managed to go on a vacation abroad. we were making twice as them. we lived in a shittier apt, we wore shittier clothes and eat worse food.

    Here is the article: it all started because i could not sleep last night, i have periodic bouts of insomnia, and last night was the beginning of one such battle. in either case, i had to be up at 5 am, therefore sleep aids were out of the question, so i decided to woman up and just pull an all nighter/all day. i took my multivitamin and a fat burner pill, and drank 3 cups of coffee, took 2 caffeine pills, and pulled through to 6. at this point i was succumbing to the yawns so i drank about 4 more cups of coffee,  ate a bagel and went my merry way to work. as a massage therapist i happen to work at a well known spa, and am considered very good at what i do. however, this morning i had an 8 am two hour couples deep tissue, and right as i walked in, i could feel my stomach begin to cramp, my butt cheeks began to clench, and so i held  that position... for the remaining 2 hrs. meanwhile, my fat burning pill is causing me to sweat profusely, my body is contorted into the most uncomfortable, keep my butt cheeks closed position possible, all while i am trying to do a deep tissue massage on a, wait for it, body builder. 

gradually little farts escape and the clinic room begins to stink, my stomach is making audible angry noises, and i am starting to feel light headed and see little black spots. 

i finally make it to the half way point, and am channeling the spirit of the little engine that could, i think i can, i think i can! 

all i can think about it letting go, counting down the minutes until i can finally use the restroom.
50 to go.
30.
10.
5.
and right at the end, with only 3 minutes to go. i sit myself. and my client knows, i know, the other therapist knows... 

and now i am sitting in shame in the restroom, trying to figure my next move out. waiting for my bf to bring me pants.

    Here is the summary: The author's attempt to pull an all-nighter and work a morning massage shift despite struggling with insomnia led to a series of uncomfortable and embarrassing situations, including severe cramps, sweating, and the release of audible farts during the massage

    Here is the article: so this happened about a month ago, but i am new in reddit and i just wanna tell a story. so before i tell this story, i am a 7th grader going on to 8th grade(just turned 13), and i am currently 5'6, and asian. so people think i'm older than i really am. also, i usually hang out with people a year older than me, which are high schoolers. so one day, me and my friend, that is a girl, were just chillin in her house. two hours has past and me and her start to get tired. she fell asleep first, laying down in a fetal position. at the time, i did like her so maybe i should get in and cuddle with her. so i did, and i fell asleep. i think like an hour later, her dad came home, and he saw me spoon her asleep. he immediately got mad, and slapped me in the face to wake me up. as a typical asian dad, who is shorter than me, instantly thought i was her boyfriend.  he got a wooden spoon, and started hitting me with it. he probably thought i was 15 or something, and ended up kicking me out of his house. i called my mom to pick me up and she didn't answer. i ended up calling my whole family three times to pick me up because my house is three miles away. no one answered so i had to walk home on a rainy day. oh yeah, it gets worse. i left my flip flops(i know, i'm stupid) at her house, and i didn't want to go  back to her house so i ended up walking home, barefoot, on a rainy day.

    Here is the summary: A 7th grade Asian boy (5'6") was spooning with a girl in her house when her dad came home and mistakenly assumed he was her boyfriend, resulting in the dad slapping him, using a wooden spoon to hit him, and kicking him out of the house

    Here is the article: so this happened about a month ago, but i am new in reddit and i just wanna tell a story. so before i tell this story, i am a 7th grader going on to 8th grade(just turned 13), and i am currently 5'6, and asian. so people think i'm older than i really am. also, i usually hang out with people a year older than me, which are high schoolers. so one day, me and my friend, that is a girl, were just chillin in her house. two hours has past and me and her start to get tired. she fell asleep first, laying down in a fetal position. at the time, i did like her so maybe i should get in and cuddle with her. so i did, and i fell asleep. i think like an hour later, her dad came home, and he saw me spoon her asleep. he immediately got mad, and slapped me in the face to wake me up. as a typical asian dad, who is shorter than me, instantly thought i was her boyfriend.  he got a wooden spoon, and started hitting me with it. he probably thought i was 15 or something, and ended up kicking me out of his house. i called my mom to pick me up and she didn't answer. i ended up calling my whole family three times to pick me up because my house is three miles away. no one answered so i had to walk home on a rainy day. oh yeah, it gets worse. i left my flip flops(i know, i'm stupid) at her house, and i didn't want to go  back to her house so i ended up walking home, barefoot, on a rainy day.

    Here is the summary: A 7th grade Asian boy (5'6") was spooning with a girl in her house while her father was away, but her father returned home and mistakenly assumed he was her boyfriend, resulting in the father slapping him, using a wooden spoon to hit him, and kicking him out of the house

    Here is the article: this didn't happen today, but is rather an ongoing situation. sorry - english is not my mother tongue.

about two and a half years ago, i moved abroad to work. i ended up in a metropolitan area, doing odd jobs, and eventually got hired in it. i have no schooling in it, i just like to tinker with computers. i also did some freelance web design, for friends and contacts. last summer, i felt content with my adventures, and moved back home again. my cousin, "florentine" (name changed), offered to sell me their iphone, and to take over (?) their contract. as i had just moved back, i was happy to do so. i still occasionally got some calls and texts for florentine, but directed people on to my cousin whenever that happened.

one day in november, i got a text message from some kind of recruitment agency/website. it said something about "one new match" for a job, and included an url. i was looking for work, but i hadn't registered with this particular agency. anyway, i was curious, so i opened it up. one needed to enter a password to see the ad, so i requested a new one, and got it in another text message. the ad was for a position as a web designer and general it contact for a firm in the city, a pretty well-known but not overtly huge company. it looked really interesting. i also noticed i had almost all the necessary skills in web design for the job. the one thing i don't have is a diploma - something the ad said was required, listing a number of necessary certificates, etc.

now, i don't know what i was thinking here, but i clicked "apply," wrote up a cover letter, and it autofilled all of florentine's details, including my cousin's school and work experience. i only changed the address. i sent it off, convincing myself i was "just curious."

one week or so later, the agency called me, saying the firm was really impressed by my application. they gave me a time for an interview there. a couple of days later, i went, again pretending that i only did it for the "experience," or that i would come clean about my identity before the interview. as soon as the manager met me at the reception desk, saying happily: "you must be florentine! welcome!", i scrapped that plan altogether.

well, you can probably guess where this is going. i have now been employed in this firm for about three months, under a false identity. it's a great job, challenging, the pay is good, and i've learned so much. but everyone at work knows me as "florentine." my work email, it accounts, "tag" for the doors, everything is under florentine's name and identity. we're the same age, at least. i work mainly with four or five older guys, so they're not people i would hang out with in my spare time.

my cousin has been employed in another company for years, and i don't meet that side of the family that much. last time i saw florentine, i asked shyly about that recruitment website, but got the response that i could disregard those text messages, "it's some old site i registered with ages ago."

there have been several dangerous moments:

- about a week in, my manager emailed me asking for my bank details, for the salary. i gave them my real account number, but, of course, florentine's name. the next day, i realised this could mean trouble, and called the finance department to let them know i was using a relative's account for now, making something up about having just switched banks. i'm not sure they had even noticed, but they told me to get my own account as soon as possible. i haven't heard from them again, but i fear the day when they come back to remind me about this.

- people at work have asked to add me on facebook. i've pretended like i don't use it, getting weird looks (most people in our industry are very active in social media.) i've considered setting up a false profile in florentine's name, but too scared that my cousin would find it. it also feels very wrong. i've taken down my own social media profiles, explaining to friends and family that i am taking a "digital break."

- the people in my department usually go out when it's someone's birthday. i'm scared they will ask when "my" (=florentine's) birthday is, or find out about it from my manager. or that the bar, if i ever go out with people from work, will ask for id.

- we have free healthcare at the firm, but i've passed on that so far, as i am afraid they would also ask for my id or for journals from my doctor, etc.

- when i was working with one client, in a neighbouring city, i had to be there for a meeting really early. my firm set up a taxi to come get me. my mom was staying with me that week. when i was getting out of the flat to take the cab, she came to the door with something i had forgotten, and i *think* she heard the taxi driver say, through the rolled down windows, "florentine?" i just went to my mom, picked up what i had forgotten, and got into the cab, and said, as silently as i could, "yes, that's me." it sounds minor, but i felt like my mom was suspicious after that.

- the final and biggest concern is of course to meet someone from work when i am with my real friends. this is not a huge city. i am more and more refraining from going out, or from meeting my friends in public places. i have nightmares about meeting my boss on the street when i am with my friends. (or to meet someone i know in real life at work, as florentine.)

i have my dream job, or something close to it, but every day, the panic grows for me. every day, i am walking on egg shells.

prior to meeting my girlfriend, i was with a woman named catherine. before that, with a woman named caitlin, and before that i was with another caitlin. you might think "oh, it's your favorite name because all your girlfriends have been named this", but that isn't the case. if anything, i'm attracted to the name and when i meet someone with that name, i immediately connect. i've adored this name since i was a little kid.

my girlfriend didn't know anything about my ex-girlfriends but in casual conversation i talked a little bit about them this morning over breakfast. she wasn't amused, not one iota. if looks could kill, there'd be a crater where my house would be.

i was over at my girlfriends house and we were just relaxing. i had this cramp on my back for a while and i asked my girlfriend if she could give me a massage. at first she said no but then changed her mind and told me to lay down. i did so, flat on my stomach, and she was on my back. she massaged me for about 2 minutes and got tired lol. this is where things got a little crazy. instead of massaging me, she began to tickle me under my armpits. i am not that ticklish except for the few sensitive places and the armpits happened to be one of them. i was defenseless since i was laying down on my stomach and the only way to stop her was to turn around. (side story: i was on the wrestling team in high school and knew my way around to get out of tricky situations. the movements are now a natural reaction.) i started to turn my body around to face her and my elbows were up. while doing this, i accidentally elbowed my girlfriends cheeks. 

i felt incredibly bad for doing that but i did not mean to at all. i never raised my hands on a girl and i dont plan on doing that ever. i started apologizing like crazy. i picked her up and carried her to the kitchen to get ice. being the best girlfriend, she was laughing like a maniac the whole time. but now and then every time i move my arms a little i can see her flinch a bit in the corner of my eyes.

    Here is the article: this was 2 months or so ago, and it was actually my buddy who brought the beer, but i was with him and it's still a funny story. 


i was visiting my friend in romania this summer, i am a canadian citizen and he is a dual canadian/romanian citizen. we were down in bucharest and he decided to renew his canadian passport while we were in the city. this can be done through the mail, but it's a lot easier to do in person. 


my buddy needed to make change for the taxi ride from the apartment we rented to the embassy, so he ran into a convince store and bought a few cans of beer and put them in his backpack. we grab a cab and head to the embassy. the embassy is in a neighborhood surrounded by other diplomatic residences and offices from around the world, and there is a lot of private security in the area. we head into the gatehouse to the canadian embassy, it's set up kind of like airport security. you show your passport, they take your phone and camera away and lock it up, and then you put your bags and metallic objects through an xray machine. 


his backpack goes into the machine, and they find the beer. they tell us the cans of beer are not allowed in the embassy, and this makes sense. i ask the guard if we can just leave the bag with him (there was absolutely nobody else at the embassy, we were there alone with the staff), but he says he isn't allowed to. he tells my buddy that he should find somewhere to hide it outside, because the paperwork is only going to take a couple of minutes. i could have held onto the bag for him, but i wanted to see the embassy, my tax dollars at work and all that. 


so my buddy heads outside, crosses the street, and tries to hide the bag among the hedges of the building next door while i'm chatting with the guard in the gatehouse. the guard notices something outside, and runs into the street, just as other private security officers come into view surrounding my buddy in the hedges. the canadian embassy guard grabs my buddy and the bag, and brings him back inside. apparently those hedges were the russian ambassador's, and the building across the street was his private residence - and my buddy had just been caught attempting to place a suspicions package in his garden. 



thankfully it was all just a misunderstanding, and nobody went to gulag. 


here's what it looks like on google maps:

his backpack goes into the machine, and they find the beer. they tell us the cans of beer are not allowed in the embassy, and this makes sense. i ask the guard if we can just leave the bag with him (there was absolutely nobody else at the embassy, we were there alone with the staff), but he says he isn't allowed to. he tells my buddy that he should find somewhere to hide it outside, because the paperwork is only going to take a couple of minutes. i could have held onto the bag for him, but i wanted to see the embassy, my tax dollars at work and all that. 


so my buddy heads outside, crosses the street, and tries to hide the bag among the hedges of the building next door while i'm chatting with the guard in the gatehouse. the guard notices something outside, and runs into the street, just as other private security officers come into view surrounding my buddy in the hedges. the canadian embassy guard grabs my buddy and the bag, and brings him back inside. apparently those hedges were the russian ambassador's, and the building across the street was his private residence - and my buddy had just been caught attempting to place a suspicions package in his garden. 



thankfully it was all just a misunderstanding, and nobody went to gulag. 


here's what it looks like on google maps:

    Here is the article: this happened around 3 months ago as of now, which i am just remembering.

 i am a 20 year-old man, single, and i was coming home from work. i work at a resturant, as a waiter and today had been a particularly busy day. i decided to fire up a bubble bath. i get it set up, and sit down into the bath. its all going well, i'm laying, relaxing, letting everything escape my mind. i turn off the water, and just rest in the bath for a bit. 

i put my head under the water, so i can get my face warmed up. once i come up, my entire face was covered in bubbles. i didn't know this, and i took a deep breath through my mouth, bringing alot of bubbles straight into my throat. i begin coughing hard. i could barely breath, the bubbles were stinging my airways. i got up and went over to my sink and begin spitting out sink water. it eventually died down and i am able to breath better again. 

also a tip: i live alone, so i could have died from a death by bubbles.

    Here is the summary: As a 20-year-old man, I was relaxing in a bubble bath after a busy day at work when I accidentally inhaled a large amount of bubbles, causing me to cough hard and struggle to breathe

    Here is the article: i recently had a breakup with my ex-girlfriend brittany.  we were together for 2 years and have been broken up for around 3 months.  this girl was my first real love.  she had my heart from day one and still does.  anyways, yesterday i get a late night call from brittany asking me to pick her up at a bar we used to go to a lot.  she was drunk and kept telling me she wanted to see me and needed me to come get her.  i still love this girl with all my heart and haven’t seen her since she broke it, so like a little bitch i went and picked her up. we end up hooking up and she spends the night. 
fast forward to this morning.  we wake up late and i needed to get to work because i had an early morning meeting with a client. brittany had some errands to run so she drops me off at the office and said she would have a friend follow her back to my work around lunch so she could drop off my car.  i end up leaving my cellphone in my car because i was in a rush. no big deal. i have a phone in my office and she would be by in a few hours. lunch comes and goes and still no word from her.  i tried calling her from my office phone, but it went straight to voicemail. i tried calling my phone too and same thing.  straight to voicemail.  this seemed strange cause my phone wasn’t close to running out of battery when i left my house.  
i decided to stay in the office for lunch even though i hadn’t heard from her thinking she was running late and would be by. around 4:00 pm i get a phone call at my office.  i figured it was brittany and i was fucking pissed by this time.  turns out it was a call from a detective with the cities police department. they wanted me to come down immediately and answer some questions. i called my brother and he brought me down to the station.  i got brought into a small room with 2 detectives and they start asking me questions about where i was today, who i was with, what i have been doing, etc.  basically they tell me that my car is wanted in connection with a drive by shooting, that they found my car a few miles from the location of the shooting, with a gun inside that is registered in my name.  this is where i start freaking out.  i remember 6 months into my relationship with my brittany she was being harassed by some guys and i purchased a handgun for her in my name as protection.  not my smartest move, but i loved the girl and would of done anything for her.  with all the emotional turmoil of the breakup i forgot to get the gun back and kind of forgot about it until now.  i explain to the cops my situation with my ex, how i let her borrow my car with my cell phone inside, how i bought the handgun for her. everything.  at this point i am scared fucking shitless, we have been talking for awhile and they don’t seem to be buying my story. i decide to ask for a lawyer. at this point i don’t know what to do.  everything in my life felt like it was turning upside down and the walls were closing in on me.  the detectives didn’t have enough evidence to keep me on a 48-hour hold so here i am.  my ex still has not been found and i haven’t heard from her, my cell phone still has not been found, and detectives are actively trying to build a case against me. my lawyer says i have nothing to worry about and i should know more in the next 24 hours.  today i woke up on top of the world thinking i was going to get the love of my life back, and it turns out she might of tried to frame me in a drive by shooting. i am in shock and disbelief and needed to get this off my chest. i will try to post an update when i know more.  remember kids.  don’t buy a gun for a girl and loan your car to an ex no matter how good she still looks. 

 

update:  well guys. i just don't know what to say right now. as many of you stated things have gotten much worse for me.

today i went to work and tried to carry on like normal. i have done nothing wrong and even though yesterday was a shitty day i should put it behind me. everone has shitty days and i am no different. well early in the morning i get a call from brittany at the office. she was frantic on the phone and just kept repeating that we had to talk. i immediately hung up on her without saying a word. well she ends up just showing up to my work shortly after the call in tears and on the verge of a breakdown. turns out the police put me under surveillance, saw her walk in, and immediately decide to detain both of us and bring us down to the station for questioning. in short, i was detained with my lawyer for awhile and brittany ended up verifying my side of the story. this is where things get really twisted and i'm still not sure how to process this information. brittany claims that she has been sleeping with my brother for the past few months and points the finger at him for the shooting. claims she was a passenger in the car but had nothing to do with it. no one in my family has heard from my brother since last night and he can't be located. brittany is in jail and i am possibly looking at getting in trouble for charges related to the hand gun. i don't know what to believe right now. this is seriously fucked.

    Here is the article: i work at a small factory where there are 8 of us in the office and about 15 or so floor workers. i have been on a breakfast smoothie fad for sometime and carry my smoothie to office. the typical day is like i reach office, have some coffee and then my smoothie. today was no different. or so i thought.

now, some of you may know that when you add protein powder to your smoothie and blend it more than normal, it will turn into a thick lump. its called a [protein fluff](http://www.ingredientsofafitchick.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/protein-fluff-5-.jpg). another fad that i am into is using super-foods. i recently got a bag of dried goji berries. and i added them to the mix. i did not know that goji berries will start turning the taste bitter by the hour. and you can see it in the color.

today was a typical day. i reached office, had my coffee and started sipping on some yummy smoothie. suddenly, i am called into a conference call, which was not scheduled. the company i work for, designs and manufactures machines for companies like 3m. this was a call from 3m regarding the machine i was designing for them. this is a new product that 3m is planning to launch in the near future. so, i run my ass into the conference, grabbing my files. what i didn't realize was that i had left my smoothie on my table and not in the refrigerator.

the conference call extends well into and after lunch hours, so we leave for lunch straight from the conference call. when i return from lunch, i see that the color changed from pink-ish red to a dark red. like the one in the picture. still, being the fool i am, i let it sit and continue with work. i work about 9-10 hours daily. so, after a few hours, at about 5pm i feel like having the delicious goodness. so, i take a sip. and almost puke up due to the horrid taste of the watery juice and i realize that my smoothie had become a fluff. i cannot throw it down the sink, else it would just stay there. and i get an eureka moment. i think its a good idea to flush it down the toilet.

i open up the bottle and give it a shake to force the fluff into the toilet. now, this is where fu happens. ever try throwing a good ol' lump into the toilet bowl? the fluff mixed with toilet water spatters. imagine a dark brown colored sputtering around the toilet flush tank and the edges of the toilet. i start to panic. if i left there without cleaning, the next person, who today would have been my boss, would think i had a big bad dump and soiled the toilet and whatnot. if my boss didn't use the toilet, then the person who cleans the toilet in the morning (he is also one of the floor workers) will go upto my boss and complain. and my boss will figure out it was me, since there were only two of us at closing. while i am deciding which path was less evil, my boss knocks on the door. i ask him to give me a minute, as i furiously wipe the toilet tank and the edge of the toilet. throw everything in the bowl and flush.

as soon as i open the door, the smell of a bad smoothie escape the restroom and as i try to rush back to my desk, i meet my boss waiting to use the toilet. he is caught my the smell of smoothie, the sight of the soiled floor and the smoothie bottle in my hand. i am pretty sure he said "what the fuck were you doing in there..."

what makes this much much worse is that this is my first job and i have been at this place for less than 3 months. now, i am scared if i become the "weird office guy".

 



update: here is the [pic](http://imgur.com/tcqfmmn) of the restroom. you can see the dark red~brownish spots on the restroom floor. those are the sputter marks of the smoothie+toilet water mix. its been about two days since the incident and no one has said anything. i guess, no one suspects anything.

    Here is the summary: The author accidentally left their protein-packed smoothie on their desk while attending a conference call, and it turned into a thick, dark brown "protein fluff" by the time they returned to the office

i open up the bottle and give it a shake to force the fluff into the toilet. now, this is where fu happens. ever try throwing a good ol' lump into the toilet bowl? the fluff mixed with toilet water spatters. imagine a dark brown colored sputtering around the toilet flush tank and the edges of the toilet. i start to panic. if i left there without cleaning, the next person, who today would have been my boss, would think i had a big bad dump and soiled the toilet and whatnot. if my boss didn't use the toilet, then the person who cleans the toilet in the morning (he is also one of the floor workers) will go upto my boss and complain. and my boss will figure out it was me, since there were only two of us at closing. while i am deciding which path was less evil, my boss knocks on the door. i ask him to give me a minute, as i furiously wipe the toilet tank and the edge of the toilet. throw everything in the bowl and flush.

as soon as i open the door, the smell of a bad smoothie escape the restroom and as i try to rush back to my desk, i meet my boss waiting to use the toilet. he is caught my the smell of smoothie, the sight of the soiled floor and the smoothie bottle in my hand. i am pretty sure he said "what the fuck were you doing in there..."

what makes this much much worse is that this is my first job and i have been at this place for less than 3 months. now, i am scared if i become the "weird office guy".

 



update: here is the [pic](http://imgur.com/tcqfmmn) of the restroom. you can see the dark red~brownish spots on the restroom floor. those are the sputter marks of the smoothie+toilet water mix. its been about two days since the incident and no one has said anything. i guess, no one suspects anything.

    Here is the summary: The author accidentally left their protein smoothie on their desk while attending a conference call, and it turned into a thick, dark red "protein fluff" due to the addition of dried goji berries

    Here is the article: like many tifu posts, this didn't actually happen today. this particular event took place when i was in sixth grade. and, i didn't actually feed the duck. the person who fed the duck was a friend of mine who we will refer to as jeff. i was with three other friends who i'll call brian, matt, and josh. i'm just spouting out common names at this point. on with the actual story. 

my sixth grade class was taking an end of the year field trip to a zoo in the city. as with any field trip, this felt like a groundbreaking experience to all of us little sixth graders and we were all very excited. before we got to the zoo, our teachers allowed us to pair up with four other classmates. i immediately got into a group with four of my friends: brian, matt, josh, and jeff. 

when we got to the zoo, we did what people who go to a zoo do. we saw the lions and about every other cool animal around. when lunchtime came around, we went and got lunch at a stand. most of my friends got cheeseburgers or pizza. jeff decided to get chicken nuggets and fries. we sat at a table in an open area around other people. 

a duck popped out of the bushes and curiously approached us. at this zoo, ducks were given the privilege of waddling about and pissing all of the visitors off. this particular duck was friendly enough to approach our table. jeff, being a nice guy, threw a chicken nugget at the duck. while the duck ate his chicken nugget, josh started to yell about ducks being herbivores and not being able to eat chicken nuggets. that didn't seem to stop the duck from eating the whole damn chicken nugget.

while we were arguing about the duck's diet, the duck got hungry again and tried to get more food from us. after ignoring him for a while, the duck quacked at us in the most vicious way it could and started to fly over our table. now, a vicious quack is pretty terrifying. here you have this sweet animal who makes cute noises and now the noises sound vicious and dangerous. it sounded as if the duck was suddenly possessed. the duck was just really pissed off. he was quacking and flapping his wings over us and trying to get the chicken nuggets. a guy who worked at the zoo ran over and grabbed the duck. he pinned the duck down on the ground like a cop and another guy came over and tried to get the duck in a net as we watched in horror. they finally wrestled the duck into the net and dragged it away while it struggled to fight out of its net. the zoo workers weren't at all surprised. they must go through this a few times a day. just a normal day at work.

    Here is the summary: During a sixth grade field trip to the zoo, a friendly duck approached our table and was fed a chicken nugget by one of my friends, Jeff, but the duck became possessive and aggressive when it wanted more food, causing a commotion and leading to the zoo workers having to restrain and remove the duck

    Here is the article: this fuck up started four days ago but since in currently lying in a hospital bed, i guess it's on going.

i was browsing r/fitness last week and told myself, "i need to stop being lazy and actually put my gym membership to use." i saw that there was a push/pull/legs (ppl) routine that i could start doing and hopefully get those gains as long as i continue.

i went to the gym on thursday night and started the pull routine which is basically deadlifts, dumbell curls, hammer curls, face pulls, seated cable rows, and pull downs. i started off with deadlifts and i felt like i must have had bad form because my lower back hurt alot. i finished the routine and went to run on the treadmill. i ran for about 20 minutes and had a huge pain in my ribs, i thought nothing of it. 

second day i went to the gym, i did a quick push routine. triceps, and bench presses. no biggie.

this is where the fuck up came hard. i was at work saturday morning and during my break i went to the gym to do legs. i did squats, leg curls, etc. my legs are pretty strong since i used to play rugby, so i up the weights even though my entire body was aching from the previous work outs. i got through the routine and went back to work. 

now my back was aching hard. i could barely lift my arms to reach over my head without being very sore. "i must be getting stronger" was my immediate thought. i should also say that my usual workouts are pure cardio like running or using the stationary bikes. so when i started changing for work, i really had to pee. you can imagine the confusion and fear i had when my pee came out looking like coke. 

i left work and went straight to the hospital. this was around 6pm. they call it rhabdomyolysis. 

https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000473.htm

which means my muscles started breaking down and the muscle content was released into my blood and can cause kidney damage. i've already gone through 8 bags of iv drip and they continue increasing the rate to flush and protect my kidneys. i've been told i'm gonna staying in the hospital for another day or two.

please be very careful when starting a new workout plan, and start slow. learn what you can and can't support. you only have one body.

    Here is the summary: The author started a new workout plan with a Push/Pull/Legs routine, but failed to listen to their body and pushed through the pain, leading to rhabdomyolysis, a potentially life-threatening condition

    Here is the article: this happened a week ago. an alternative title would be: "tifu and nearly got my head lopped off in class"

i recently re-started school (i was home schooled for a while) in this international school, that's supposedly one of the finest in the country. 

i typically enjoy history and social studies - this year should be no exception, eh? flash forward to two weeks into the school year, we're having a test. the teacher's a funny guy, so he adds a bonus question, "are you wearing underwear?" lol.

a couple of days later, while discussing school stuff with my parents, i mention the bonus question. my dad's a teacher himself, and he does make a lot of jokes in class, so i figured, he and the history teacher would get along.. well, snap my neck and call me broken..

in our next class with the teacher, he pep-talks the class. "how long have i known you guys?" he asks - mainly directing the 'old' students. he talks about how he got pulled into the headmistresses office after someone complained about a bonus question. then, he talks about how this time he'll let it go, but should someone complain again, he'll take any and every measures to find out who did it. 

the class erupts into a silent discussion - who did it? does that mean that the person complaining didn't wear underwear that day? i look over to my seatmate - she knows. she saw me writing up a journal entry about it. i'm relying on her to keep her mouth shut - but the witch hunt has already started.

so yeah.. *i really should complain about a teacher threatening the class.* ahem. really, though, i didn't have any problem with the bonus question. but the school does have high standards, and it's a bit unprofessional for a teacher to ask such a question.

 

ps: i'd give you guys a proof (the test paper), but he hasn't returned them yet.

edit: wow.. definitely opened up my eyes to the issue. i'll take it up to case - if he does anything else creepy, i'll be a trigger-happy snitch for the headmistress. thanks you guys.

    Here is the article: mandatory "happened 2 days ago".

i am currently at a very large gathering of youth in the mountins of the eastern united states, hosted by an orginization known for being prominently masuline in nature.

at this gathering there are a plethera of different activities to entertain the many youth, spread throughout a roughly 100 square mile area. things like ziplines, scuba diving, rifle shooting, and the occasional concert. the food is quite sub-par, but the rest of the activities make up for it.

after a rather large concert, my group of friends and i started the long arduious trek back up a mountin to our camping area. the food that day had been particularly unpalitable and i had decided not to eat anything. having walked a good 10 miles before the concert, i was rather spent when i had arrived, let alone 4 hours later. the walk is rather mundane until the last quarter mile, where the path inclines to almost 45 degrees.

by the time i reached the incline i was tired and hungry, and wanted to get to the top as fast as possible to eat some of the more edible food i had hidden. i tied my boots, and took off into a run (or what counts as running going up a gravel path on a mountin). ignoring the warnings and protests of my companions i make it to the top turn into our campsite and promptly collapse from sheer exhaustion. almost entirely unable to move i drink the entirity of the 3 liters of water strapped to my back and the 4 packs of gummies i had on my person. after about 20 minutes i managed to crawl into my tent and pass out.

the next day i'm feeling much better and decide to eat breakfast, and head out with a friend to partake in the most popular pastime of trading patches and personal belongings. after treaking arround from area to area to find a popular set of patches based on an english comedy group, we are messaged to return to camp roughly 5 miles away. after about a mile i realize that i'm not going to make it back to camp, and check myself into one of the many needed medical tents (teenage boys tend to injure themsleves quite frequently). as i walk into the tent, i yet again run out of energy and plop into a chair.

after about an hour of drinking suger water and eating cereal bars i am able to aquire a ride back to camp, and rested the rest of the day. that night i learned that what i experienced is known as hypoglycemia, and is not something you want to do once, let alone twice in 24 hours.

there are 3 days left. lets see if i do it again.

so back then, i had a friend, who was way older than me which is around 5-10 years older than i was back then. his parents own a party organizer company and they had this tricycle that they use to deliver party stuffs from their base to their clients party place. he used to let me borrow it despite not having a license yet and being under-aged so long as i ride it within our village's premises only. back then, i did not know how to ride one so his sister and her friend thought me how to drive it. i was very thrilled about how easy it is to handle a manual transmission motorcycle, with a sidecar. when i got the hang of it, i'd ride around smirking at my friends at the basketball court showing my bike riding skills.. until that day...


it was just a regular morning (summer vacation days) and i was bored so i asked to borrow the tricycle again from my friend and rode it around our village smiling at people and nodding at them like a fool, also, like a mother fucker. (well.. i was a kid)


foolishly enough, i saw my school service, which is a van, that was just about to leave home. due to the urge of showing off my skills to our school service driver, i tried to overtake him through his left side to give him a smile. while i was on the process of overtaking him, he immediately stopped and then baammm! i accidentally hit our school service's rear bumper with the wheel of the sidecar of my friends tricycle.


the school service driver stepped out of the vehicle to take a look at the damage. he laughed hysterically discovering that his client's child had just hit his service vehicle. i immediately asked him yelling "why did you stop?" he replied, "you should have been alert!" and then i laughed back at him and say sorry. i told him to call our house and drove away immediately to bring the tricycle back to my friend's house. good thing there was no obvious damage done to my friend's tricycle.


after returning the tricycle to my friend, i ran lightningly fast to our house just to answer that fucking telephone before my mom, maid or someone else gets to it first, i was able to get there before our phone started ringing. i was standing in front of our telephone waiting for the call, looking very nervous knowing that my parents will discover what i've done (the horrors of getting a storm bolt to the head and not being allowed to play pokemon for a while ). i even checked the phone if it has a dial tone a couple of times just to make sure.


finally, after around 10 minutes, the phone rang. the owner of the vehicle was kind enough to let me do the job of telling my parents. the owner told me how much it would cost to have it repaired (2,500 philippine pesos or $50 usd) and explained to me why it costs that much.


my father was still at work and my mother was at home. so i had two choices, wait for my dad to deliver the bad news, knowing that i'd get a storm bolt to the head or tell my mom right away before my dad comes home, knowing that she might give me a bolt as well. after thinking about it for a while, i decided to go for my mom. i'd rather get hit by her than my dad anyway. 


so my mom was in her bed, with her laptop, working as usual and i told her everything. i was already bracing myself knowing that she'll hit me but i was wrong. not only that she did not hit me, she smiled at me and asked how much would it cost. i told her the price.. she embraced me telling me that i must not repeat it again. she also asked our maid to go to our school service's house to pay for it. 


i was happy and kind of bewildered at the same time. everything went smoothly and our school service driver and owner never really told my dad about what happened.


now that i am already 23 years old, my dad still doesn't know about it. also,  i haven't driven a motorcycle ever since that event.

    Here is the article: this happened a couple of hours ago. i had just arrived at my hotel from the airport for a business trip. i was pretty excited because this was my first time in mexico. anyway, i got to my hotel at around 11am and couldn't check in. so, i decided to drop off my luggage but keep my backpack to explore the town. big mistake. i still had my passport in my backpack. so, foolishly, i ventured out into the town to check out the local market. it was decently crowded because it was near the border and while i was browsing someone managed to steal my passport and my wallet. it wasn't until i got back to my hotel at around 3 when i realized this so now i'm just trying to contact the bank to see if i can cancel my cards. i have no idea what to do about the passport though. fml

    Here is the article: actually happened yesterday.

this morning i was taking a shower and had just finished when my boyfriend walks in like a zombie to go to the bathroom to pee. our bathroom is small so i couldn't get out of the shower because he was in the way. exited that he was up twenty minutes early i eagerly talk him into staying awake so he could help me make breakfast and we would have more time to spend together before leaving to go to work.

i should have just let him sleep. after much prodding(he had so much pee) he decides to stay up so he gets in the shower and it gets cold since i just took one. usually the water stays hot longer, i've taken a shower for an hour before (my showers on a work day consist of around 15-20 minutes). so now he's upset because he has to take a cold shower. 

then after the shower he gets dressed and can't find his black dress shoes. he recently got hired on full time from his co-op job and wanted to look nice so they would place him in a customer based job. he's a programmer and his job makes programs as well as trains and sells the programs to businesses. but any who. we just moved so the house is a mess and he doesn't know what happened to the shoes (he really liked these shoes) so now he has to buy another pair/ wear brown ones for today. 

so the work day goes by and his doesn't get any better. his coworkers forgot to tell him they were going to lunch so he arrived late and had to go by himself :( 

he had a late meeting that day so he got home around 7. i figured i would do laundry and get it done by the time he comes home, wednesdays are my usual laundry days anyways. but of course our neighbors were using the laundry room so i had to wait. forgetting that we were going to h&m after work, i load the clothes up at around 6:45. he walks in a little after 7 asking if i was ready and i was like "shoot! i forgot we were going to h&m, i have our clothes in the washer." he gave me the most i cant believe you did that face. i was like "it's ok the wash cycle will be over in 15 minutes then we can just bring the clothes up here and dry them when we get back" his i can't believe you did that face didn't go away. he asks if i checked his pockets. of course i said no he should clean his own damn pockets out before putting the laundry in the hamper. i cook, clean, do his laundry. he can at least take out the things in his pockets! i mean of course if its noticeable i'll take it out like his wallet or knife, i'm not that much of a bitch. but unless the clothes feel extra heavy i just throw them in the washer out of the good faith my wonderful boyfriend cleaned them out. 

well, my boyfriend does those studies where you go to a place, they ask you questions about gum or have you wash your hair with this bottle of shampoo and then a week later you answer questions and boom $100. he had left a check for $100 in his pocket, and i had washed it. hoping it would be ok, i go get the clothes and check his pockets. nothing. i asked him which pants they were in because i couldn't find the check. i get the pair of pants he tells me and check again. and low and behold the check, in a small wet ball at they very bottom of his front pocket. good.

so after discussing whose fault it was, we agreed it was both and head on to h&m and then agreed i would never get him to stay awake after he pees again.

 

edit: why so much hate? i'm genuinely admitting i fucked up. i don't need to be called names. maybe some of you should check the rules.

    Here is the summary: The author's boyfriend walked in on her while she was showering, and she tried to get him to stay awake to spend more time together before work, but it ended up with him taking a cold shower and forgetting his black dress shoes

    Here is the article: so, unlike many other tales, this happened minutes ago.

i'm currently a high school student studying web development, and hosting a tiny (read: used to be winxp) web server using linux.

for my culminating, i decided to have some fun and reach out of my comfort zone. instead of building something using pure html and css (the frame and paint, if you will), i decided to make something a little more dynamic using php and mysql (a self-building frame and a box that stores information).

so, i get a basic demonstration going: a table with a list of names taken from a mysql database. once that was working, i decided to go the extra mile and make a registration form. it would let you add another list to the table, then you could go back and see the name you added at the bottom.

after writing all the code for the form, submit page, and tweaking some stuff with the name listings, i noticed something weird. the submit page was blank. normally, this means that there's an error, but i can't see it. go back try again, with a different name. no luck.

finally, i force reload the form, thinking that it wasn't the newest version. it comes up blank, just like the submit page.

i close the files i have open, and reopen them. blank. empty. four hours of work gone. the name listings, the form, and the submit page. gone.

so, i close everything, turn on some soothing music, and open /r/tifu

. this is something to deal with when i'm not at the school library.

    Here is the summary: The author, a high school student studying web development, spent four hours working on a project and then lost all their work when they force-reloaded the form and the pages came up blank

    Here is the article: i recently got new car with manual transmission. given that last time i drove stick was about 20 years ago i am still trying to get used to it, but i love it!

earlier today i was getting ready to drop my little one at day care and as usual go start the car. typically i first put her in car seat, but this time for whatever reason started the car first. my driveway is at the angle so when i park the car nose facing the road i put gear in reverse, e-break on. so my daughter is standing just to the left of driver's side rear door. i push the clutch in, start the car, but forget to put gear in neutral. car jerks back pretty fast but not by much. this scared the hell out of my daughter pretty bad i guess and all i see in the mirror her turning around and running towards garage door, which was closed, plummeting her little pretty face right in it. i don't know why, but i chucked a bit (i know it's bad) and jumped out to see if she ok. she was fine, not a scratch. i guess she didn't know what has happened so there were no tears. all she said was, "daddy wanted to hurt me!" i am a monster.

    Here is the summary: You started your new car with a manual transmission, but forgot to put it in neutral before starting the car, causing it to jerk back and scare your daughter

earlier today i was getting ready to drop my little one at day care and as usual go start the car. typically i first put her in car seat, but this time for whatever reason started the car first. my driveway is at the angle so when i park the car nose facing the road i put gear in reverse, e-break on. so my daughter is standing just to the left of driver's side rear door. i push the clutch in, start the car, but forget to put gear in neutral. car jerks back pretty fast but not by much. this scared the hell out of my daughter pretty bad i guess and all i see in the mirror her turning around and running towards garage door, which was closed, plummeting her little pretty face right in it. i don't know why, but i chucked a bit (i know it's bad) and jumped out to see if she ok. she was fine, not a scratch. i guess she didn't know what has happened so there were no tears. all she said was, "daddy wanted to hurt me!" i am a monster.

    Here is the summary: The father, who had recently purchased a new car with a manual transmission, started the car with his daughter standing next to the car, but forgot to put the car in neutral, causing the car to jerk back and scaring his daughter

    Here is the article: this happened back when i was a teenager living with my mom.

my stepdad was in the hospital for some pretty serious stuff so my mom was spending pretty much every day there with him. i would come home from school and do chores and junk to try to keep things running. well one day my girlfriend and i come home from school on a pretty nice day, and my mom called and asked if i could walk the dogs. i agreed to and told my girlfriend to just wait at home since they were big dogs, but i had a bit of a headache, so i took an aleve before i left.
this is where it gets funny. i ate a few pieces of black licorice before leaving, which was the first time i'd ever eaten any before. so about halfway around the block i start sweating and itching like crazy, and my skin starts tightening, so by now i'm full sprint with a pit bull and a malamute and i run into my house and just yell "babe! i'm itchy!!!" 
paramedics came after i passed out, and when i woke up i told them about the licorice and they asked if there was anything else and eventually, by the time i met up with my mom at the hospital, they figured out it was naproxen sodium, the main shit in aleve.

    Here is the summary: The author, a teenager living with their mom, is asked to walk the dogs while their mom is at the hospital with their stepdad, and they agree despite having a headache and eating black licorice before leaving, which leads to an allergic reaction and a frantic run home

    Here is the article: so this happened to me when i was about 9 years old, that's 19 years ago but you will soon find out why i remember it like it was yesterday.

i was in primarily/elementary school and we had a culture where the affluent kids would bring something to share with the class during their birthdays. one of those kids happened to be a friend of mine and he had a really awesome birthday party in class, his mom came with a cake and drinks for everyone, i remember the presentation was very classy and legit. 

fast forward to the day before my birthday. i tell him (rich friend) and two other friends of mine that the next day is my bday and they get all excited but i tell them also not to tell anyone so it doesn't seem like a big deal because i knew we were not rich and my dad was very economical but thoughtful. 

so that evening i asked my dad if he could pull through for me and he was cool with with it, he went to the store and bought a bag of eclairs just enough for the whole class to get at least two each (eclairs was a premium brand of chocolate candy at that time) so i knew i was set. 

the next day, somehow the other kids in my class knew whose bday it was. they were already asking me what i was going to do early in the morning and i told them i just brought some candy to share with the class. long story short some greedy kids ended up convincing me to give them some since they could not wait until lunch time (this was the appropriate time to share your stuff with the class). 

so lunch time came and i realize that i may have made a terrible mistake by letting them eat my éclairs, many kids begged me that i just decided to give the ones who didn't get some by the end of the day. lunch time was over and just before the next lesson started some kids ratted me out to the teacher that it was my bday, i guess maybe because they didn't get their share and they thought i was not going to give them.

so the teacher asked if i had something, i said yes and went to the front of the class and placed the éclaires on her table so she could maybe help me give all or some of the kids. she looked at the bag and to my shock slapped it hard enough to make them scatter all over the class. 

she then told me to pick them up and go back to my sitting position and started the next lesson. i was really messed up and did not talk to my class mates or friends for the rest of the day. i felt so embarrassed to even tell my parents about it. i just consoled myself with the remaining éclairs.

    Here is the summary: The author's rich friend and two other friends were excited to learn that the author's birthday was the next day, but the author asked them not to tell anyone to avoid making a big deal out of it

    Here is the article: maybe this wasn't exactly a fuck-up, per se, but it did cause some negative reactions.

so, last night, for halloween, i didn't feel like dressing up, but i decided it would be fun to do [corpse paint](http://imgur.com/auy3yh2) and go out to meet friends in it. 

it's about 7pm, and i'm painting my face (almost done) when suddenly the doorbell rings. outside there's like 10 kids, all in their lame store-bought costumes and waiting for sweets. now, i decided it would be a good idea to open the door and scream at them, since they wouldn't be expecting it. 

and hell, they weren't. half of them started screaming in fear, the other half started crying. better still, i had no sweets to give them. i could say both the kids and their parents (who were walking with them) were pissed and very frightened after leaving my door, not to mention all the people whom i ran into while going to meet my friends.

    Here is the summary: The author's decision to wear corpse paint and scream at trick-or-treaters on Halloween resulted in negative reactions from both the children and their parents, with some of the kids screaming in fear and others crying

back in third grade there was a girl,  lets call her "kelly" well anyway kelly had a chronic skin rash which i now realize was probably plaque psoriasis . anyway she was always very bright and teachers loved her. being the delinquent i was at that age, i was essentially her opposite in about every way. i eventually became so mad and jealous that teasing was the only way i could express my anger (i know this sounds kind of like in defending my actions, but trust my i'm sick to my stomach with guilt as i write this).
so i started calling her lizard girl, and eventually the whole class got into it and eventually the whole grade, she would constantly burst into years over the name calling over something she couldn't control and after 4th grade she left our school and began home-schooling because she couldn't take it. it even got so bad as she tried to cut her arms with the safety scissors in a desperate attempt to be sent home from school. years later i am so ashamed of my actions and in the off chance that "kelly" is  a redditor and is reading this. i am so sorry. you have every right to hate me and i don't expect you to forgive me, but i'm sorry.

    Here is the article: this actually happened today, though i really wish it didn't.

to start the story off, i was hanging out at my boyfriend's house and we were eating pizza while watching some videos on youtube. his mom called from the kitchen telling me to come there, with uncontrollable laughter. 

being curious, i decide to go figure out what's going on. when i get there my boyfriend's brother, mom, and sister are laughing and snickering. "come on, drink this and i'll give you $5!" she usually makes a lot of smoothie concoctions, i figured this was one of those. at worst it'd be a bunch of fruit and veggies with soy milk. thinking this was an easy five, i took the glass and downed it. 

this is where i fuck up. thinking it'd go down no problem, i begin to gag and can't swallow. they're edging me on so i hold my nose and force it down... and then it burns to the point where i can barely breathe. it feels like my throat is closing up and i leap toward the sink to get some water, only when the water goes in everything comes out. not only did i puke up the drink, along with it came the pizza i was craving all day and finally had only half an hour ago. 

turns out that the drink was something called "fire cider" which is supposed to relieve joint pain and do some other things. it contains raw apple cider vinegar, honey, oranges, lemons, onions, ginger, horseradish, habanero pepper, garlic and turmeric. i'm not a person who enjoys spicy things so of course it didn't go down well.

his mom felt bad for me and ended up giving me $10 instead, but she recorded all of this but deleted it after she saw how miserable i was and they all got quite the laugh out of it. i sat bent over the sink for a good ten minutes before i felt like i could walk all the way back to the so's room and sink into his bed and cry.

    Here is the article: it's been a few hours since this fuck up and i'm starting to realize how big of a mistake this was.

went on a date with a guy i've been talking to for a while and we decide to go to the local park. it's around 7pm and the park is closed because of... well... idiots like me.

so we go to the swings and he gets in the tire swing and wants me to spin him. easy, i think, i use to do this for other kids all the time when i was little. i just gotta grab onto the chain and twirl in circles.

well, it turns out i'm much bigger and much less athletic than i was 8-10 years ago, and i managed to fling myself directly onto my ankle. i tried to brush it off as nothing, but i felt like i was going to throw up and felt light headed, so i decided to sit down. 

after sitting there for a good 20 minutes trying to hold a conversation in a pain i've never felt before (i've never had an *actual* physical injury before, do this is an entirely new kind of dull, throbbing pain), i decide to drop him off and go home. 

it's now midnight and i'm in too much pain to sleep, my ankle is swollen to the size of a couple of golf balls and is showing no signs of not hurting any time soon.

    3. Rate the summary with 5 percentages, where each one represents how likely the summary is going to get a score from 1 to 5. For example, if you think the summary is 80% likely to get a score of 5, 10% likely to get a score of 4, 5% likely to get a score of 3, 3% likely to get a score of 2, and 1% likely to get a score of 1, you should rate the summary as 80, 10, 5, 3, 2.

    Here is the article: it's been a few hours since this fuck up and i'm starting to realize how big of a mistake this was.

went on a date with a guy i've been talking to for a while and we decide to go to the local park. it's around 7pm and the park is closed because of... well... idiots like me.

so we go to the swings and he gets in the tire swing and wants me to spin him. easy, i think, i use to do this for other kids all the time when i was little. i just gotta grab onto the chain and twirl in circles.

well, it turns out i'm much bigger and much less athletic than i was 8-10 years ago, and i managed to fling myself directly onto my ankle. i tried to brush it off as nothing, but i felt like i was going to throw up and felt light headed, so i decided to sit down. 

after sitting there for a good 20 minutes trying to hold a conversation in a pain i've never felt before (i've never had an *actual* physical injury before, do this is an entirely new kind of dull, throbbing pain), i decide to drop him off and go home. 

it's now midnight and i'm in too much pain to sleep, my ankle is swollen to the size of a couple of golf balls and is showing no signs of not hurting any time soon.

but it doesn't stop there. because i'm a guy and my date was a guy and we live in the south, i have to be very careful about how i explain this to my family or risk opening an entirely different can of worms.

    Here is the summary: The author went on a date with someone they'd been chatting with, but ended up injuring themselves on a tire swing at the park they visited

    Here is the article: this happened yesterday. so one of my friends asked me if i wanted to try weed this week end. i wanted to try for a long time so i said yes.

technically, it was my second time. i've tried it last week but got no effects from it, so i tried again this week end.

this time was a little different. my friend told me we would get better results by taking a strong huff first, then take a deep breath of fresh air. so i do as he says, and it hurt like shit. after five times i couldn't take anymore, my lungs were (metaphorically) on fire.

soon after, i start to feel it. my whole body is numb and my perceptions slow down. at first it felt sort of funny, but then i get nervous. i don't like it, i don't like it at all. i tell my friend i feel afraid and need to lay down. i lay down on his couch, but the feeling of fear intensifies. it felt like i was dying, my brain slowly turning off. i feel sick, i throw up, a lot. i even tear up a little.

i try to relax and accept the effects but i get even more anxious. even music worsen my paranoia. i spent the whole night barfing in a bag, to the point where i didn't have anything to puke. i felt like i was going to have a panic attack. thankfully, i fall asleep a few hours later.

this was by far the most terrifying experience i had in my entire life. i don't know if this was linked to my adhd or the vyvance pill i took 13 hours before (which i take every morning, 5 days a week). anyway, i'm glad i'm alive and didn't get psychotic. i'm never touching that shit ever again.

    Here is the summary: The author tried weed for the second time and had a terrible experience, feeling numb, anxious, and experiencing intense fear and paranoia, leading to vomiting and a near-panic attack

    Here is the article: so i work in a small locally owned hardware store, my boss the store owner also works at the store, and parks his car in the same spot everyday. being the young "punk" teenager that works there i load all the customers cars, with there purchases. 

it was late in the day, and in my down time at work i assist in the lawn mower repair shop. we had just finished repairing a small zero-turn mower, and one of my coworkers told me to go test it. that where things went down hill literally. 

i took the mower out and around back of the shop where there is some flat grass where we test out the mowers, that rapidly transitions to a steep embankment. where all the employees park at the bottom.

i was driving the mower along the edge of the hill, when the front turned and pointed down the hill (front wheels are just casters on a zero-turn you have no control over them). this shot me down the hill, i pulled back on the control arms only causing me to speed up, because the wheels started spinning. i was a on a crash course with my boss's car. 

i avoided a direct hit with his car, instead destroying the employee parking sign, and only hitting the side of his bumper. the mower came out undamaged, the sign and post where destroyed, and the bumper was cracked and dented. somehow i still have my job.

    Here is the article: alright, so me and 3 of my friends just got through hanging out all day at a renaissance fair and figured we'd finish the day by eating some breakfast at ihop. lemme preface this by saying i don't get out much. i have never had a girlfriend/ really talked to girls short of "well, how about that weather?". i'm 23 too.
     so we get our table and this gorgeous indian woman that looked about my age comes to take our order. i got so stunned that i held everyone up, so she gave us another moment to decide and left. i figured that if i didn't say anything, i'd be in the same boat i'm in now, so i should just throw it out there.
      
     when she comes back, she asks, so we all tell her our order, and she asks me "alright, is that all for your order?". then i try to casually say "no, wait, and i have your number too?", and she shoots me down, looking all flustered and nervous. i expected my friends to joke on me about how i just bombed it, and maybe get a "better luck next time", but almost immediately after she's out of earshot, my friends kick both my shins under the table and rough me up a bit without causing a scene, yelling "what the fuck, bro!?!" now, i'm a small guy, and all of my friend have 60+ pounds on me, easily, so i'm incredibly bruised by this. i'm also thoroughly confused, since i thought i was the one that should have been embarrassed by getting shot down in front of my friends.
     so she comes back with our food and takes our payment with scarcely a word besides what she has to say to us, and rushes away every time. then my friends all scrapped together an abnormally large tip to her to "apologize" for what i did for some reason, and hurried me out of the door.
     if anyone could shed some light on this, i'd be grateful, because i just don;t get it. i guess i goofed up some type of social rule or something, and i feel kinda robotic for neither feeling disappointed for getting declined, nor understanding why what i did was bad, or just how bad/ embarrassing it was for everyone else, especially the waitress.

the worst part is that i have a job lined up for january 13th and now i have to tell my boss about the fuck up and maybe have my offer declined. 

fuck.

edit: things turned out decently. i did an internship this semester that i'm going to get to retroactively count for credit. i will graduate from college without taking any additional classes. i told my boss at work and he told me that he liked my integrity and honesty for coming clean about it and having a plan to recover. the job and salary are still on the table regardless of my degree. 

more on the reason i failed: the professor is an extremely hard grader with no teaching ability to merit it. the average % in the class was a 58. i got a 54, and he would not bump me up. every professor in the department knows that him and one other professor are terrible, but they can't be pushed out. my overall gpa, even with the d is a 3.4 (i only lost about .06 points because of it). this semester, i also got a b in a graduate level class with a foundation in high-level mathematics and completed two project based classes with a's, one from the best/most challenging professor in the department. sure, maybe i could have studied more, but this professor isn't free of blame on this part.

    Here is the article: a few years ago my parents relocated to the usa from canada, more specifically they moved down to winchester, virginia. 

now, i had already been down to visit them once in the past. they had me bring their cats down after they settled into their new home (i'm allergic... but that's a whole other tifu).

fastforward and roughly a year has passed. 

like the good son i am, i figure it's time for me to visit ma and pa for a little while. (tbh i just want to do some cheap shopping and drink copious amounts of american water, i mean beer)

anyways, the morning i am leaving for my trip i realize i've lost my gps... well fuck. so before i leave, i head on over to the local canadian tire and pick up the cheapest unit i could find.

i install the brand new gps in my truck and program my destination into the unit. it informs me that i will arrive in winchester around 9pm. it's 10am now, so it's going to be a 11 hour drive. i thought it was going to be shorter, but my memory seems to think this is about right.

so off i go. 

i thoroughly enjoy driving alone, i usually spend that time doing some introspective thinking or in-vehicle karaoke.

after about 4 hours of easy driving, i am getting close to the usa/canada border. 

but something isn't right, i'm heading much further west than i remember from my last visit. i stop for some fuel and do a quick search on google to make sure i'm heading the right way.

at this point i'm pretty much equal distance between the detroit border crossing and the buffalo border crossing. my last trip i went through buffalo, so this time i say fuck it and decide to cross at the detroit crossing instead. i'm in no real rush and a change of scenery might be nice. so i venture onwards.

once i make it to detroit, i realize why my parents cautioned me not to go through there. not only did the border agent think it necessary to thoroughly inspect my truck, but i'm pretty sure i saw a bunch of hobos with fingers inside of each others pooper in a strangers car with talk radio playing real loud...

with detroit behind me, my gps arrival time has been bumped closer to 10pm as a result of the long wait at the border and a few pit stops. but the good news is the highways have cleared up and i get to enjoy some pretty easy driving.

around 8pm my dad calls and asks how the drive is going and when i'll be arriving. i tell him i'm almost there and should be about another 2 hours. he asks where i am and i inform him that i'm close to dayton ohio and that i'll probably be stopping for a quick break. he asks again where i am, and i tell him again that i'm nearing dayton... 

he tells me he will call me back.

i pull off the highway and hit up a gas station to fuel up and grab some snacks. i sit in my truck and wait for him to call me back. i don't want to end up in an american prison cell for using my cellphone after all.

when he calls, he asks me for a 3rd time where i am, and for the 3rd time i tell him that i am about 2 hours away in dayton. he starts laughing...

he informs me that i am actually 6 hours away...

this can't be right i tell him, i'm looking right at my gps and it clearly says i am only 2 hours away. something isn't adding up. i go into the settings and that is when i realize my mistake. 

i am indeed only 2 hours away from winchester. winchester kentucky that is.

after a bit of cursing & swearing, i reprogram my gps for winchester virginia and learn that i am indeed over 6 hours away. 

i make it to their house about 3am where my dad is sitting there waiting for me, laughing his ass off.

    Here is the summary: After realizing I lost my GPS, I purchased a new one and set the destination to Winchester, Virginia, only to find out that I had programmed the wrong Winchester and ended up in Kentucky, resulting in a 6-hour detour

For example, if you think the summary is 80% likely to get a score of 5, 10% likely to get a score of 4, 5% likely to get a score of 3, 3% likely to get a score of 2, and 1% likely to get a score of 1, you should rate the summary as 80, 10, 5, 3, 2.

    Here is the article: a few years ago my parents relocated to the usa from canada, more specifically they moved down to winchester, virginia. 

now, i had already been down to visit them once in the past. they had me bring their cats down after they settled into their new home (i'm allergic... but that's a whole other tifu).

fastforward and roughly a year has passed. 

like the good son i am, i figure it's time for me to visit ma and pa for a little while. (tbh i just want to do some cheap shopping and drink copious amounts of american water, i mean beer)

anyways, the morning i am leaving for my trip i realize i've lost my gps... well fuck. so before i leave, i head on over to the local canadian tire and pick up the cheapest unit i could find.

i install the brand new gps in my truck and program my destination into the unit. it informs me that i will arrive in winchester around 9pm. it's 10am now, so it's going to be a 11 hour drive. i thought it was going to be shorter, but my memory seems to think this is about right.

so off i go. 

i thoroughly enjoy driving alone, i usually spend that time doing some introspective thinking or in-vehicle karaoke.

    Here is the article: wasn't today, but yesterday but yeah i'll tell it like its today. throwaway cuz my friends stalk me.

so recently in world history class, we learned about nanking, you know, the brutal raping and massacre of the chinese people by the japanese. i didn't pay attention too well and was kinda awkward since i'm the only japanese kid in my class.

later that day, i was coming out of the locker room from track practice, when i saw the chinese girl that i've liked for a while that lives in my neighborhood. (lets call her sarah). i know she rides my bus, but she always rides in the back of the bus, while i ride in the front with my friends. i never had the balls to really talk to her, but i chose to ask for a ride from her today because my friend that usually picks me up, had to go to a dentist appointment. so i took this opportunity to talk to her a little.

we talk a bunch and hit it off with her, and then she says i can get a ride back home. her dad arrives, he's pretty cool unlike most asian fathers. he asks if i'm chinese too and i tell him i'm japanese and he doesn't seem to mind, just out of curiosity. sarah asks if i want to get chinese food with them. i say "sure i love nanking!" to impress her father with my few chinese-skills that i learned in chinese class. (this is my 3rd year.) her dad stares straight at me and asks in the most sternest way "what did you just say?!" jenny looks at me in disgust and shakes her head no slowly. i said it again, thinking my tones are different and say "wo ai chi *nanking*" (translation: i love nanking). he yells even sterner and grabs a vaseline jar and looks ready to throw it at me. "do you think this is some kind of joke. leave!" he drives by a curb and while i'm too afraid to know what's best for me, i get out of the car. i hear jenny's dad yelling at her to that "he never wants to see that jap again."

i review my words on google translate and see that "nan" does not mean panda.

    Here is the summary: The author, a Japanese high school student, unintentionally offends Sarah's Chinese father by saying "wo ai chi nanking" (I love Nanking) during a ride home from school, not realizing that "nan" does not mean panda, but is a derogatory term for the Nanking Massacre

    Here is the article: this actually happened about 12 hours ago. i was outside most of the day cutting up all the tree limbs that had fallen down during a recent storm, and from the storm before that because i procrastinate with the best of them. as a card carrying daywalker, my skin had a healthy shade of steamed lobster. after a long day of sawdust and near misses with the chainsaw, i decided to celebrate my injury free day with a fire. i got my drink and lawn chair all set up. cue fuck up.
     i tried to light the fire a few times but it wouldn't stay lit, so i decided to speed up the process. never start a fire with gasoline kids. i poured some into a cup (because only an idiot would pour it out of the can right?) and told my 5yo to stand back. i started pouring it on what i thought was a completely snuffed fire when foom! the fire ball got me a little bit so i jumped back dropping the cup and sending the remaining gasoline splattering all over my legs and patio. instant liquid fire from toe to waist. i supermanned into the grass and rolled like a champ. i got it out after what felt like an eternity and stood up to the sound of my cheering son saying " daddy you did so good!! they even teach us that in school!!" i smiled and laughed and said hey how about we go find your mom. 
    watching the dr cut away they charred parts of skin was about when the shock wore off and i could feel every last puff of air like jagged nails. 

  you know the part they leave out of the stop drop and roll phase? its where the dr has to use tweezers to get every piece of dirt that you just ground into your second degree burns so you don't get an infection. i don't think that would be as catchy though.

    Here is the article: this actually happened  about 6 years ago but it is the epitome of my stupidity. 

so, i was camping with a group of kids and adults from my church's scout group. we were near the snake river in idaho. we were going to be rafting the river and just having fun for a few days. well, the first day we got to camp we had nothing to do in the afternoon, so we decided to make a rope swing. now, at the time, all the kids were 16-18 and the adults were in their 30s. we had just enough common sense to make a swing on a large branch and not some spindly thing. the branch we picked had a diameter of about 12 inches so we figured it could hold our weight. after finding this branch we tied a hammer to our rope and threw that over. success! our make shift swing was in order. we tested this out and it work perfectly. 

over the next few days we grew bored with simple swinging and progressed to more risky activities with the swing. we were full on sprinting to get as high as possible, putting multiple people on it, etc. you know, the kind of stuff teenagers are want to do. now, throughout this time the branch had held its own admirably well (we didn't pick a slouch of a branch after all). if this branch was a bro, he was the ultimate bro. always there for us and never slacking when we needed him. the best kind of bro. we had no reason to doubt the bro-branch when we attempted our final stunt. 

at this point, we were completely bored with simple swinging so we decided to haul people to the top like a pulley. i, myself, wasn't dumb enough to try this at first. that branch was 30 feet off the ground so there was no way i was going up there without having someone test it out. the guy who volunteered was about 220 and really built. a state champion wrestler so he was big enough and brave enough to assuage all our doubts about the sturdiness of the branch. he went up, touched the branch and chilled up there for a few minutes. no problems.

now that i had seen this system in action i was confidant enough to try it myself. i weighed only 125 so i had no reason to doubt that the branch would give out on me. 

oh, how wrong i was. 

i began my ascent and was steadily raised to the top. 10 feet up. 20 feet. 25 feet. nothing was going to stop  me from hanging at the top of this motherfucking tree. i was inches away from my goal. 30 feet. i did it! i had reached the branch! 

**crack**

oh. fuck. 

right as i touched it, the branch just snapped off and i plummeted to the ground. 30 feet, straight down. 

now, take a moment to imagine a bunch of 18 year old kids sitting under a large branch that is falling. the logical thing to do is to scatter and get out from the impact zone, right? well, everyone but one kid thought so. the wrestler. he had the noble thought to try and catch me and try and avoid getting a faceful of branch. well, he didn't exactly succeed. 

i fell straight down and hot the ground as if i were just standing up. all the impact shock went up my knees and spine. the wrestler missed me and instead caught the branch. *kind of.* he ended up getting hit on the head by this thing and got a concussion. 

now i was in immense pain and was writhing on the ground. everyone had recovered from the shock and was attempting to figure out if anyone was hurt. my first thought was to have someone help me up so i could try and walk this off. as i attempted this, the adults in the camp finally had gotten to the disaster site and were pushing me back down telling me not to move. all i could do was lie there and attempt to assess the damage. i was down. wrestler was down. bro-branch was down. this wasn't good. 

after a few minutes i convinced the adults to let me get up and try walking this off. i was lucky enough that i was able to walk and didn't seem to have a broken ankle or leg. but by god, was i in pain! i hobbled off to a chair by the fire so i could get off my feet for a bit. 

i have to say, the fact that everyone at camp was completely sober is what sets this apart. we weren't being stupid drunks, we were just stupid kids. 

now, i was in pain but felt well enough that we weren't rushing to the hospital to get me examined. i was just going to tough it out until we left. *two days later.* luckily, most of the pain had subsided and i was just extremely sore, although, i tried to avoid walking as much as possible.  

the ride home two days later wasn't much better, though. the rode was bumpy as fuck and every jostle was sending new pain up my spine. and to make matters worse, every time i would sneeze it would be like i was having a seizure. completely uncontrollable spasms for every sneeze. and i suffer from a photic sneeze reflex (commonly called sun sneezes) so i tend to sneeze quite often in bright light. 

we finally made it home and i walked in to greet my parents. my mom was exuberant to see me but all i could manage was a weak smile as i stammered "mom, i need to go to the hospital." to her credit, she took that reasonably well and i told her the whole story. she just shook her head saying how dumb i was and we left to get me checked out.

fast forward a couple days later after i have had x-rays and cat scans done. turns out i had 3 compression fractures in my lower vertebrae. and the best part of the whole diagnosis? there was nothing to be done. i had to deal with it and simply take it easy while the vertebrae un-compressed as much as possible. at least most of the pain had subsided.

now, nearly 6 years later, they are still slightly compressed, albeit better than they were when this happened. i still get pain back there from time to time as well and can't really be too aggressive on it.

we finally made it home and i walked in to greet my parents. my mom was exuberant to see me but all i could manage was a weak smile as i stammered "mom, i need to go to the hospital." to her credit, she took that reasonably well and i told her the whole story. she just shook her head saying how dumb i was and we left to get me checked out.

fast forward a couple days later after i have had x-rays and cat scans done. turns out i had 3 compression fractures in my lower vertebrae. and the best part of the whole diagnosis? there was nothing to be done. i had to deal with it and simply take it easy while the vertebrae un-compressed as much as possible. at least most of the pain had subsided.

now, nearly 6 years later, they are still slightly compressed, albeit better than they were when this happened. i still get pain back there from time to time as well and can't really be too aggressive on it.

    Here is the summary: The author, along with a group of teenagers and adults from their church's scout group, went on a camping trip near the Snake River in Idaho, where they attempted to make a rope swing using a large branch, which held up well until the author attempted to climb to the top, at which point the branch snapped off and the author fell 30 feet to the ground, injuring themselves and another person

    Here is the article: this happened just now.

so, on friday, i had a test in my ap english class. naturally, being known as the classic "good kid" (to keep this reputation, i used a throwaway account :p) i studied for the test. now, before the test, i heard other students lamenting about how they would fail the test, they didn't study, etc. the usual. so then, we took the test, i felt like i did pretty well, and so i thought that would be that.

**nope**

so, i returned to school today, and i went to that class, and the teacher talked to us sternly about a "cheating incident" and that the perpetrator would be in for some ***really big trouble.*** ehh. i had a few suspects in the class, knowing some of them, but surely it could not be me. during lunch period, i was called to the office. usually, when i am called to the office, it's because my parents dropped something off, or i forgot a paper in a class, and just about that. well, when i got to the office, they called me down to the head of discipline's office. i then started to get slightly worried about what happened. as soon as i'm down there, i see the principal and just about the rest of the administrative board. i get sat down and the first thing that he says is...

"i know about your cheating in your classes."

i was very confused. i didn't know what happened. i asked them about what happened, and sure enough, there was a cheating incident in the ap english class and it was pinned on me. apparently, it was because i got a 100 on the test, and the second-highest grade was a 39. i asked them how that proved that i cheated, and they said it was because some of the others were a students and that the test was probably impossible sans cheating.

they called both my parents down, and my parents argued for my side saying that i would never cheat, they need to show the evidence, yeah. they said that even the most unsuspected people can be cheaters and they they have a zero-tolerance policy against cheating and were by faculty policy not allowed to show the evidence. they said that i was so bright and that i had so much potential but i had to cheat and now i went and destroyed it all.

i was then expelled, told to get my shit, and go home. and now i have no chance of getting into my dream college, hell, probably won't get into college at all, won't get a job that pays above minimum wage, essentially, my life is fucked. and now i'm sitting here at my desk in nothing but my underwear playing l4d2 and writing a tifu on reddit.

    Here is the summary: The author was expelled from school after being accused of cheating on a test, despite their claims of innocence and their parents' arguments on their behalf

well, he told one of his standard puns regarding his junk, to which we all groaned, and we all wanted him to stop.  my brain struggled between "cut it out" and "knock it off".  naturally, what came out was "cut it off".  

everyone looked at me in shock, half thinking i was serious.  i quickly tried to correct myself, but it was too late.  everyone but him realized my intentions and laughed it off, but i could only fake laugh with him smiling at me with the most deadpan stare i've ever seen.  

after that, no one could let that go, but nothing's been the same. shit, i just had a brain fart, but every hangout with that guy now seems forced. 

at least it shut him up.

    Here is the article: so like most tifu stories this didn't happen today but it happened last night so it is still pretty fresh.

last night i went to dinner with one of my really good guy friends (we have actually been dating casually for about 2 months now). we went to dinner, which was great, and then we went to starbucks to get coffee. we got there, ordered our coffee (i got a tall pumpkin spice latte...i know, basic but so good.) and had a really good time there as well. well my mom texted me and asked me to pick up some eggs while i was out since we didn't have any at home. this wasn't a problem for me and i asked my friend if he would like to come with me. this is where the story gets good. 

we walk into safeway, and head back to egg aisle. well, safeway has these character balloons that are the worst renditions of the characters ever and quite frankly hilarious looking. we get to the egg aisle, and it's me, my friend, and another man. i grab the eggs i'm getting and as i'm turning around my friend makes a comment about how spiderman has baseball mitts for hands. i don't know why, it could have been i was feeling giggly from the caffeine or just because i was having a great night, but this comment made me laugh so hard. so hard that i farted. and it wasn't a cute girly fart either...this fart was a fart that comes out of a bearded man who just bench pressed a medium sized elephant. sure, it was embarrassing but something i could live with. then comes the worst part. i'm laughing so hard at spiderman's mitt hands, and laughing so hard at my fart, that i start to pee. i peed my pants. not just a tiny trickle, a waterfall. i'm doubled over, i'm laughing, i'm farting, and i'm peeing all while my friend is standing there. on top of that, the man that was in the aisle with us definitely saw the whole thing.

my friend (who is more than a friend) was really cool about the situation and we had a really good laugh about it this morning. and he still likes me so that's a huge plus. regardless, that is the most embarrassing thing that has happened to me to date.

    Here is the summary: The author had a hilarious and embarrassing experience last night while on a date with a guy friend, where they laughed so hard that they farted and peed their pants, with the whole incident being witnessed by another man in the Safeway egg aisle

    Here is the article: this actually happened many years ago, when i was in middle school.  a buddy of mine, nathan, had a yearly halloween party where he'd invite a bunch of folks over for a sleepover.  snacks, soda, movies, etc.  the goal was always to stay up all night, but that didn't always work out, and people would drop off to sleep, one by one.

this particular year, matt was the first to fall asleep.  we made a lot of fun of him, as it was only 11 p.m. and the rest of us were wide awake.  as he snored away, myself and another friend (jeremy) decided we wanted to prank him.  after some deliberation we decided on a tried and true classic.  we got some shaving cream and a feather, sprayed a nice large dollop in matt's hand and i handed jeremy the feather.

*"you do the honors."*


**hold on, wait a moment.** let's go back in time, first.  back to two days prior.  matt, jeremy and i are on the bus, on our way home from school.  we're talking about the upcoming party.  who's gonna bring the penthouse and playboy magazines? does anyone we know have any porn on vhs?  does nathan own super nintendo or does matt have to bring his with him?  you know, really important adolescent business.  we arrive at jeremy's stop and he gets off.  now the reasons are lost to time, but there was some sort of indiscretion or offense that jeremy had caused, and he needed punishment.  nothing severe, just a little kick in the pants to put him in his place.  so matt and i got to planning, and came up with our scheme.

**back to the future... well, past.. you know what i mean.**

jeremy has the feather, matt is passed out with a mountain of shaving cream in his hand, and jeremy starts to tickle matt's face with the feather.  matt stirs slightly, groans, and then lies still once more.  jeremy tries again, making the feather dance across matt's face.  matt moves again, this time his hand goes toward his face to scratch at the tickling spot.

then suddenly matt's hand abruptly changes direction.  before jeremy can react, matt's lathered hand connects with the side of jeremy's head with a satisfying *thwop*.  shaving cream flies everywhere, and the room erupts into the kind of  frenzied laughter that only sugar-high teenagers have.  nathan's mom screams at us from upstairs to tell us to be quiet, and eventually we're able to stifle it.

jeremy was picking shaving cream out of his ear for 20 minutes.  i still applaud matt's patience while he pretended to sleep.  eventually we moved on to watching *batteries not included* and reading letters to penthouse. the incident was largely forgotten by the time we reached high school, but i think on it occasionally and laugh to myself.

    Here is the summary: In middle school, Matt fell asleep at a sleepover before the rest of the group, and Jeremy and the narrator pranked him by tickling his face with a feather, causing Matt to accidentally slap Jeremy with a shaving cream-covered hand, leading to a chaotic and hilarious scene

jeremy was picking shaving cream out of his ear for 20 minutes.  i still applaud matt's patience while he pretended to sleep.  eventually we moved on to watching *batteries not included* and reading letters to penthouse. the incident was largely forgotten by the time we reached high school, but i think on it occasionally and laugh to myself.

    Here is the summary: In middle school, Matt, Jeremy, and the narrator planned a prank to tickle their friend Matt with a feather while he was sleeping during a Halloween party, but Matt unexpectedly retaliated with a slap to Jeremy's head, causing chaos and laughter

i was bored at home this particular afternoon when i started swiping right on tinder (i live in a small mountain town there isn't much to swipe at so most swipes go right). match with a cute girl my age (24) who says shes is hanging around her hotel's hot tub. 

"how far are you from xyz hotel?" she asks
"ten minutes" (!!!) i reply

i rushed to get bathing suit on and decided to throw some jeans on over in case we got drinks or went somewhere after. i got to the hotel's pool area and saw her sitting in the hot tub with her arms stretched out on the sides looking way too cool/hot for me. because i was so eager to get in with this girl i didn't even think to unbutton/zipper and ended up taking pulling down everything..jeans and bathing suit. i quickly pulled up my suit but the damage was done. we had an awkward 30 minute conversation with lots of small talk before i politely excused myself and went home.

    Here is the article: so standard this tifu took place two days ago. i was lying in bed at 2:00 in the morning with my girlfriend watching some tv. things start getting a bit heated and it turns into some play fighting. we're having a bit of fun and all is going well until the fu happens.

she puts her hand towards me as i raise mine and she finger slams into my palm. i hear a *pop* and immediately  know what i'd done. she has pretty weak fingers from doing it before but yeah, i dislocated one of her fingers. 

she proceeds to do one of those crying laughs for about ten minutes before getting up the courage to put it back in. it then got worse when this sent her into shock and she went really cold and couldn't function for about an hour. after some ice to the finger and a hot water bottle to keep her warm she returned to normality.

    Here is the summary: During a playful moment with my girlfriend, I dislocated one of her fingers when she finger-slammed into my palm, causing her to experience shock and temporary loss of function
